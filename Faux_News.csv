" Republicans Turn On Trump, Throw Him Under The Bus For F*cking Up Health Care Plan (DETAILS)","When Republicans celebrated Donald Trump s undeserved election victory, they probably never imagined he d damage the party as badly as he already has in just nine weeks.This week, Trump once again embarrassed the GOP by messing up their first attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare. Not only did Trump fail to sell the disastrous American Health Care Act, but he pulled the bill on Friday. Understandably, Republicans are pissed that Trump conducted things this way, and are distancing themselves from him more than ever. In fact, they re blaming him and saying that he and the White House had been an obstacle from the start, setting them up for failure. One House Republican (who wanted to remain anonymous) said: Their heart was not in the healthcare battle. Think about the level of intensity on the executive orders for the travel ban, or on the wiretapping claims. He certainly checked the boxes on healthcare, to his credit. But it s self-evident there was not a certain level of intensity devoted to this. Trump and his minions have countered this claim, with Press Secretary Sean Spicer issuing a statement on Saturday: The president and vice president left everything on the field  They were making calls and having members to the White House all week. In total, we spoke or met with over 120 members of Congress. And yet, this doesn t seem to add up, considering that Trump s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner were nowhere to be found as sh*t was hitting the fan on Friday. Kushner, who is one of Trump s key advisors, was actually skiing with Ivanka in Aspen as House Republicans tried to pass their horrible health care bill and failed. And it s not just Kushner they re pissed at   it s Trump himself.According to House staffers and other GOPers, Trump didn t seem focused when in meetings concerning the Obamacare repeal. Another unnamed Republican said: Halfway through that meeting, he stopped to talk about Gorsuch. His mind was bouncing around. I never felt they were dialed into this. Maybe next time the GOP will think twice about letting a five-year-old become their party s nominee. What we re witnessing here is the breakdown of the Republican Party, and it s so humiliating that we almost feel bad for them. Almost.Featured image is a screenshot",News,25-Mar-17
" Sean Spicer’s Twitter History Comes Back To Bite Him In The Ass, Trump PISSED (TWEETS)","No matter what Donald Trump does or where he goes, he s never actually doing the right thing and fulfilling his duties as POTUS.One might think that after suffering such a monstrous fail with his American Health Care Act, the president might double down and get right back to work on his quest to somehow  improve  Obamacare, which he insists is awful despite the fact the Americans overwhelmingly approve of it. But no   instead, Trump decided to spend his Saturday the way he s spent pretty much every Saturday since he became president   by playing golf.In the short 9 weeks of his presidency, Trump has already gone golfing 12 times   which is far more than any of his predecessors and former President Barack Obama, whom Trump once criticized for taking any downtime to play golf. Trump has been getting blasted for his weekend golfing getaways, and the White House has gone to great lengths to hide it:However, Trump s cover was blown when some Instagram photographs of Trump surfaced, revealing to Americans what Trump REALLY does when he has his  meetings. Pool was told Trump was in meetings at Trump National this afternoon. This Instagram photo posted from the course says otherwise pic.twitter.com/WMudqofGmO  Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) March 25, 2017As you can imagine, the internet didn t take kindly to being lied to, and went after Trump. One of the gems that resurfaced from this Twitter attack was this amazing old tweet from White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer   which is going to basically make Trump explode:Wow. That s one tweet Spicer probably wish he d never posted during Obama s presidency, because now it s insulting HIS boss! To make this even more humiliating for Spicer and Trump, Spicer recently defended Trump s  privacy  when he was questioned about how often Trump golfs.Twitter is basically losing it over this hypocrisy, and we can t help but laugh along:@seanspicer ? pic.twitter.com/pw2LQVmW1h  Parts Unknown (@nia_negasi) March 25, 2017   Featured images via Gage Skidmore / Flickr",News,25-Mar-17
 WATCH: FBI May Have VERY High-Level Witness To Blow Russia Scandal Apart,"CNN is reporting that Trump s disgraced national security adviser, Gen. Michael Flynn, may be the key to blowing apart the Russia scandal. Three of four key people, including Carter Page, Roger Stone and Paul Manafort, who have their own suspicious ties to Russia, have volunteered to speak to the House Intelligence Committee, but we haven t heard from Flynn recently. CNN s sources explain why: It is starting to look like, from my sources and then also from open reporting, that Mike Flynn is the one who may have a deal with the FBI, and that s why we have not heard from him for some time. It sounds somewhat uncertain and it is right now. However, Seth Abramson, who s an attorney and also a professor at the University of New Hampshire, broke it down this way:(1) First, as an attorney I want to make clear that, if this @CNN analyst s sources are correct, the #Russiagate scandal is blown wide open.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(2) The FBI flips witnesses, turning them into cooperating individuals, _only_ when they can help secure conviction of a bigger  target.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(3) Michael Flynn was the National Security Adviser for the President of the United States. The only _bigger_ target is Donald J. Trump.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(4) But Flynn also held a clandestine meeting with Russian ambassador/spy Sergey Kislyak and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner in December  16.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(5) And Flynn coordinated with infamous Iran-Contra figure and Russian oil/gas pipeline advocate Bud McFarlane in hiring Trump s Deputy NSA.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(6) And of course Flynn had the highest possible clearance and greatest possible access to POTUS in discussing matters of national security.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(7) Flynn s hire as NSA was controversial even suspicious when it was made due to Flynn s absolutely _terrible_ reputation in Washington.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(8) This suggests the hire wasn t based on merit, but rather the fact that Flynn is _known_ to have ties (in-person ties) to Vladimir Putin.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(9) We should conclude from the foregoing that Flynn was in the best position of _anyone_ involved in #Russiagate to see _all_ its contours.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017(10) Given all of the above, we can say that if any one person could bring down Trump due to #Russiagate, it s the man the FBI may now have. pic.twitter.com/sLwjBTVTcF  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 25, 2017There are reports that Flynn s spokesperson has said that Flynn will neither confirm nor deny whether he s cooperating with the FBI at this time.This is a developing story that s worth keeping an eye on, because this scandal is snowballing as more information comes out. Should CNN s story come to pass, then everyone involved, including Trump, will be in a world of shit.Even Devin Nunes, who keeps insisting that finding the leakers is mre important than getting to the bottom of the scandal, won t be able to maintain his position.Featured image by Kevin Hagen via Getty Images",News,25-Mar-17
 Rep. Ted Lieu Torches ‘Evil’ Donald Trump Over His Cruel Approach To Healthcare (TWEETS),"Donald Trump and Paul Ryan thought they d get to pass what could possibly be described as the most cruel approach to healthcare imaginable this past week. However, they couldn t even get members of their own party to go along with what was clearly a disaster. To that end, Trump, never one to take the blame for anything himself, decided to blame the Democrats for not voting with him on his horrible bill   even though it could have passed through the House of Representatives without so much as a single Democratic vote. Now that this excuse won t fly, Trump is back to his old line: Let Obamacare  explode. Well, Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA) is calling Trump on his horrible approach to handling the Affordable Care Act. Taking to Trump s own favorite platform, Twitter, Rep. Lieu said to Trump: President Donald Trump: You truly are an evil man. Your job is to help Americans. Not intentionally try to destroy their lives. ""President"" @realDonaldTrump: You truly are an evil man. Your job is to help Americans. Not intentionally try to destroy their lives. https://t.co/2M94E1g39b  Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 25, 2017Rep. Lieu them went on to remind Trump of the oath he took when he assumed the office of the presidency:Mr. ""President"": Art II of Constitution requires you to faithfully execute laws passed by Congress. Subverting #Obamacare violates your Oath https://t.co/2M94E1g39b  Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 25, 2017So, in other words, if Trump tries to sabotage the law, he will be in violation of his Oath of Office. Then again, he violates it every day, so what s one more instance of said violations, right?Ted Lieu is correct, though. Donald Trump is evil. This whole thing was nothing but a massive ego trip for him, and he doesn t give a damn about the citizens of this nation.Featured image via By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Getty Images",News,25-Mar-17
 WATCH: Joy Reid And Panel RIP House Intel Chair And Trump Stooge Devin Nunes Apart Piece By Piece,"An examination of Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes on Saturday was totally devastating and damning.This week, after FBI Director James Comey refuted Donald Trump s claim that he was wiretapped by President Obama, Nunes held a hasty press conference in a desperate effort to portray Trump as a victim whose wiretapping accusation was right all along.Nunes is in charge of the committee that is supposed to be investigating Trump s Russia scandal, but he tied the wiretapping claim into it in order to distract from the main investigation.But reporters have been digging into Nunes this week and have found some bombshells that should bring Trump and the GOP down, and Joy Reid and her panel discussed the top four.First, Nunes told Mother Jones reporter David Corn that he has never heard of Carter Page or Roger Stone, both of whom are Trump stooges with ties to Russia. Again, Nunes is the chair of the House Intelligence Committee charged with investigating Trump s ties to Russia. He should damn well know who Stone and Page are.Even Corn was  stunned  by Nunes answer and had only three possible explanations. Either he s a dimwit who hasn t read a single story about the matter he s supposed to be vetting or he has some brain disease and can t remember or he was lying to me,  Corn said.  Those are the only options I can think of. It was a bizarre moment and you re right, we could spend the next hour talking about all the weird things and bizarre things he did this week from cancelling hearings to coming forward with incomplete information to rushing to Trump. Corn then warned that Nunes demonstrated that the House Intelligence Committee is broken and is incapable of overseeing what the Executive Branch is doing. It is a breakdown, and I say this to be serious. It s the breakdown of the Congressional intelligence oversight process and the only reason we let the Executive Branch do secret work in terms of espionage, counterintelligence, counter-terrorism is because they ve overseen by the Legislative Branch. And Devin Nunes just showed this week that there is a complete breakdown in that process. Reid then turned to national security expert Malcolm Nance and asked him about why Nunes abruptly left his car after taking a phone call and disappeared for a bit. Nance opined that Nunes got called to the White House and was told to present the  incidental surveillance  as proof to vindicate Trump. Because soon after his disappearing act, Nunes called his press conference. Nance went on to call Nunes  clueless about what surveillance is. But that s not all. Reid asked Sarah Kendzior, who is an expert on authoritarian states, about Nunes taking information about the investigation to Trump.Kendzior explained that Nunes is  supposed to be watchdog but he s acting like a lapdog  and that instead of investigating, he s  acting like an informant.  She cited Nunes  behavior as just another example of Trump s corrupt regime.Scott Dworkin chimed in when Reid asked about Nunes owning part of a winery that has a direct connection to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin through a Russian investor. Dworkin pointed out that it should not be so easy to be connected to Putin and stated that Nunes should not be a congressman and he definitely shouldn t be the chairman of the intelligence committee since his wallet is so close to Putin.Here s the video via VidMe:Reid and the panel also wondered how Nunes ended up becoming the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee considering he has no intelligence experience and doesn t know much about it.But the bottom line is that Nunes just destroyed his credibility and the credibility of the committee he chairs. This investigation needs to be turned over to a special prosecutor and an independent commission because it s clear that Nunes is more interested in helping Trump cover up his Russia scandal than he is in investigating it and finding the truth.Featured image via screenshot",News,25-Mar-17
 Trump Staff Hangs Absurdly Offensive Abraham Lincoln Banner In Mar-A-Lago Dining Room,"A few years ago, teenage pop star Justin Bieber angered many people by commenting that he thought Holocaust victim Anne Frank would have been a  belieber.  Today, the 70-year-old President of the United States and his enablers pulled a similarly bone-headed stunt. Bieber was 19 at the time. What s Trump s excuse?Visitors to Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort were shocked to find that over the weekend, his staff hung banners  honoring  Abraham Lincoln by photoshopping a  Make America Great Again  trucker hat onto the former president s head.This is genuinely hanging in Mar-a-Lago for a dinner honoring Lincoln  pic.twitter.com/sRQLtjwBi4  B (@bXbyrne) March 25, 2017The banner went up in conjunction with a Republican Party of Palm Beach County dinner to celebrate  Lincoln Day.  Honoring Lincoln apparently didn t include celebrating his actual accomplishments, but connecting him to Donald Trump.They were so proud of this feat of egomania that they distributed the picture in the dinner program as well.The cover of the 2017 Lincoln Day Dinner program for Republican Party of Palm Beach County tonight at Mar-a-Lago. @WPTV pic.twitter.com/SJPlB8V6qb  Andrew Lofholm (@AndrewLofholm) March 24, 2017The only person who might find this stunt in good taste is Donald Trump   who recently learned that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. Great president. Most people don t even know he was a Republican. Right? Does anyone know? A lot of people don t know that. We have to build that up a little more. The Florida Republicans hosting the dinner (which, itself, is probably an ethics violation due to the fact that the current president owns the resort and will profit from it) seemed to take Trump s idea and run with it.That s an awfully big dose of wishful thinking. While it s impossible to know what a man who has been dead for 152 years would make of modern life, the idea that he would enthusiastically endorse a race-baiting grifter like Donald Trump is hard to picture. Trump couldn t even get a single living president to support him. Adding to that, the fact that Lincoln is widely regarded as perhaps America s greatest orator only makes it more unlikely that he would be impressed by a guy who can barely string two sentences together coherently.I mean, seriously  look at this garbage: Look, having nuclear my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart you know, if you re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world it s true! but when you re a conservative Republican they try oh, do they do a number. It s not exactly  Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. If Lincoln were alive today, he would probably have a really articulate, beautiful way of saying  Donald Trump, go screw yourself.  I ll have to settle for saying it as plainly as that.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,25-Mar-17
" After His Latest Major F*ck Up, Trump Heads Back To His Golf Club AGAIN","After offering Americans a sh*t sandwich for health care coverage, a plan which was slammed by conservative groups, doctors, hospitals, democrats, and liberals, Trumpcare, the Republicans attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, failed. Alleged president Donald Trump couldn t even get his own party to back his major campaign promise to eradicate Obamacare and replace it with a viable alternative. Republicans have been promising that for seven long years and the best they could come up with is tax cuts for the wealthy while the middle class and lower income Americans suffer. Naturally, Trump blamed Democrats.So what does an amateur president do after such a stunning defeat? The 70-year-old headed to Trump International Gold Club in Virginia on Saturday, reportedly for meetings, although, who he is meeting with is only open to speculation since it s not clear from pool reports.What is clear is that this marks the former reality show star s 12th visit to a golf course since his inauguration just two months ago. This also marks Trump s eighth weekend in a row making a trip to a Trump-owned property, the latter of which brings up his massive list of conflicts of interests. The former highlights his hypocrisy since he blasted Barack Obama for playing golf while he was in office.This also marks Mr. Trump's 8th consecutive weekend visit to a Trump-owned property (Mar-a-Lago club, FL golf club, VA golf club, DC hotel) https://t.co/uoLa4UvKKO  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 25, 2017Trump obviously needs a safe place to go to. The Trump-owned business, though, will profit from his presidency. This has been a reoccurring problem with the alleged billionaire, who, by the way, still refuses to release his tax returns.Each vacation Trump takes is costing the taxpayers dearly. Don t  worry,  though! As Trump put it in a tweet reportedly while he was en route to the golf club,  ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry! ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2017Trump is literally hoping Obamacare, which provides coverage for millions of Americans, will  explode. How is any of this Making America Great Again?

 Fox News FIRES Longtime Executive For Making Racist Remarks To Black Employees,"For years, Fox News hosts have been spewing racist remarks without consequences but apparently, when the racism is directed against their own African-American employees, the conservative network draws a line.Fox has reportedly fired longtime comptroller Judy Slater for making racist comments to black employees after her behavior was brought to the attention of her bosses.According to The Wrap,Slater, who is white and has worked at Fox for 19 years, was accused of asking one African-American employee if all three of her children were fathered by the same man, according to an individual familiar with the matter. She also referred to African American women as  sista  and stereotyped African-American employees  speech, openly complaining that they mispronounced words, the individual said.In a statement, Fox News condemned Slater s  abhorrent behavior  and claimed that such behavior is not tolerated by the network. We take any complaint of this nature very seriously and took the appropriate action in investigating and firing Ms. Slater within two weeks of this being brought to our attention. There is no place for abhorrent behavior like this at Fox News. Of course, if Fox News really takes racism seriously, they would oust personalities like Sean Hannity and Bill O Reilly, who have also made racist remarks over the years.Just last October, Hannity literally offered to send President Obama and his family back to Africa even though President Obama and his family are natural-born citizens of the United States.Nobody would have ever said this to any of our presidents who served before Obama, but Hannity did and he should have been fired on the spot.That same month, Bill O Reilly gave the green light to a segment featuring Jesse Watters mocking Asian-Americans. The segment drew instant outrage and condemnation from multiple Asian-American organizations. However, O Reilly is still on the air and Watters was promoted.O Reilly and Watters have often teamed up to reach new heights of racism, including a segment in 2015 aimed at shaming homeless black people.Fox host Jeanine Pirro should also be fired for taking racism and hate to a new level. Not only did she blame Michelle Obama for all the bad things that have happened in the world in a highly disrespectful rant, she told a black  Hamilton  actor to shut up and stick to hip-hop.So while it s good to see Fox News punishing racists in their ranks, they need to start cleaning house by firing the hosts who spew racism on the air. If Fox News truly takes racism seriously, that s what they need to do.",News,25-Mar-17
 ‘Pizzagate’ Conspiracy Rally Melts Down When Crowd Can’t Agree On Whether To Blame Jews,"A DC rally meant to prove  the existence of the long-debunked conspiracy theory known as  Pizzagate  reached a painfully stupid peak when the crowd couldn t agree on whether or not a secret Jewish cabal was to blame.For those that can t recall this particularly bit of idiocy coming from the right, Pizzagate was a conspiracy floated by right-wing fringe sites that claimed Hillary Clinton and other high-ranking politicians were involved in a child-sex ring in the basement of a pizza restaurant in Washington D.C. The conspiracy had been repeatedly disproven, but the requirement of having at least two brain cells and the ability to use them meant that a vocal group of nutjobs believed a cover-up was at play. It would have been mostly harmless if not for the fact that a believer of the conspiracy brought a rifle into the actual pizza place demanding to see the sex dungeon in the basement. He was arrested, but not before discovering the pizza place has no basement.His arrest did not stop the conspiracy. The remaining fanatics decided to host the DC rally to keep the conspiracy alive. Unfortunately, a gathering of this size of people dumb enough to believe the conspiracy in the first place was bound to have problems. It didn t take long for cracks to emerge. Naturally, xenophobia played a part.Members of the crowd  some of whom carpooled in a giant trailer decorated with Trump decals   grew tense when one speaker defended his personal theory that a Zionist plot was at the heart of Pizzagate. Others said they supported Israel. A fight ensued. Will Sommer of The Hill was there to witness the meltdown in all its glory:Pizzagate rally has switched into high context mode. References to international conspiracies, lines from the Book of Ephesians  Will Sommer (@willsommer) March 25, 2017Pizzagate rally divided over Zionism!

They did this not out of the kindness of their own hearts, but because the owner of Comet Pizza threatened to sue them if they didn t stop lying.

 The Wall Street Journal HUMILIATES Trump And GOP For Choking On Healthcare Bill,"Donald Trump and his Republican allies are total losers, and even the conservative-leaning Wall Street Journal admits it.The GOP proved that they are totally incapable of governing on Friday as the vote for Trumpcare failed to materialize after Republicans leaders in the House canceled the vote because they could not get the necessary support for it from their own party.It marked the second time in two days that Republicans failed to even bring their healthcare bill to the House floor for a vote.Of course, that s a good thing for the American people because the GOP plan would have gutted the Affordable Care Act, stripped health insurance from over 20 million people and caused premiums to skyrocket to prices unreachable for most Americans.But the failure to pass their own bill despite controlling Congress and the White House demonstrates once and for all that even with absolute power, Republicans are incapable of governing.For seven years, Republicans vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They rehearsed the vote to repeal it over 60 times in order to pander to their rabid base. But when it came down to it, Republicans choked under pressure from millions of Americans who angrily protested their effort to kill healthcare.In an editorial on Friday, the Wall Street Journal humiliated Trump and the GOP for failing to govern. House Republicans pulled their health-care bill shortly before a vote on Friday, and for once the media dirge is right about a GOP defeat. This is a major blow to the Trump Presidency, the GOP majority in Congress, and especially to the cause of reforming and limiting government. Republicans have campaigned for more than seven years on repealing and replacing ObamaCare, and they finally have a President ready to sign it. In the clutch they choked. Indeed, and it goes much deeper than that. For years, Republicans obstructed any and all legislation, including their own bills, all while insisting that they were capable of governing if only they could get a Republican in the White House.In November, they got their wish, but still could not pass their own bill, and the Wall Street Journal predicts that they won t repeal the Affordable Care Act at all. The risk of political suicide is not only too high to ignore, it s clear that there are conservatives who think government works best by failing to do anything. There will be no such repeal in this Congress, and probably not in any other. Republicans run the government and that means they are responsible for what happens in health care  Much of the current conservative establishment profits from fanning resentments, not governing. Legislative compromises don t help Heritage Action raise money for its perpetual outrage machine. An earlier generation of leaders at Heritage understood that the goal of winning elections was to achieve something. The current leaders seem happy with failure. In the end, the Wall Street Journal noted that this legislative failure is an  ominous  sign that Trump s presidency is a failure. Perhaps Mr. Trump and the GOP can recover from this debacle, but as an opening act to a new Presidency the collapse of his first legislative campaign is ominous. And that s particularly embarrassing because Trump has not even completed 100 days yet.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,25-Mar-17
 Republican Has Epiphany: ‘Wracking My Brain To Think Of One [Positive] Thing Our Party Has Done’,"Just a few years after Republicans shut down the government. Then came so close to defaulting on America s debts that the nation s credit rating was reduced. Then nominated a reality television star and serial liar as president. Then elected said reality television star and serial liar to actually be president even after a tape was released where he bragged about sexual assault. Republican Representative Tom Rooney had an epiphany: Maybe  maybe the Republican Party is a joke?It may seem obvious to some, but even Republicans themselves are starting to question whether or not the GOP has a single good idea in years.Rooney s epiphany came after he watched how his party botched a healthcare reform bill that the GOP had spent seven years promising to pass. From start to finish, the effort was a spectacular failure. The bill itself was a rush job and so poorly constructed that an independent assessment of its effects found that it would result in 24 million fewer people having insurance while also not saving the country any money. The bill s popularity hovered around 17%. Then the right-wing section of the Republican Party actually revolted against the bill because it didn t kick more people off of insurance. Then Trump demanded the GOP prove its loyalty to him by passing the bill anyway   and nobody listened. The bill failed before it even got a vote, humiliating both Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan.Republicans, including Rooney, were shook. So much so that Rooney began saying the one thing you as a Republican are never supposed to say aloud.As the prospect of a loss became more real on Friday, the frustrations of GOP lawmakers loyal to the leadership began to boil over.  I ve been in this job eight years, and I m wracking my brain to think of one thing our party has done that s been something positive, that s been something other than stopping something else from happening,  Representative Tom Rooney of Florida said in an interview.  We need to start having victories as a party. And if we can t, then it s hard to justify why we should be back here. Like many Americans, it s slowly dawning on Republicans that they really are the  Party of No.  Obstructionists. Haters. Fanatics. But not lawmakers.And Rooney wasn t the only one. The healthcare bill implosion was so incredible that other conservatives were having similar thoughts:GOP aide on CapHill: ""I'm starting to think that while we're pretty good at winning elections, we're not great at the whole governing thing""  Alex Roarty (@Alex_Roarty) March 24, 2017 Not great at the whole governing thing  could very well be the official Republican motto.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,25-Mar-17
 Petty Trump Responds To Trumpcare Failure By Hoping American Healthcare System Falls Apart,"Donald Trump is so petty about not getting his way on healthcare that he is literally hoping that our healthcare system fails.On Friday, House Republicans were forced to cancel a floor vote on their Trumpcare bill for the second time because it was heading for a massive defeat.It was a humiliating blow for a party that controls the House, Senate, and the White House.The Republican healthcare plan would have repealed the Affordable Care Act. Over 20 million Americans would have lost their health insurance and premiums would have skyrocketed.Only 17 percent of Americans supported the bill, which makes it far less popular than the Affordable Care Act.Trump immediately reacted by blaming Democrats, but again, Republicans control Congress so that excuse won t fly.On Saturday morning, Trump reacted again by expressing his hope that the healthcare system will collapse and told everyone not to worry because he will create a plan  for the people,  even though his previous attempt would have hurt millions.ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2017What you just witnessed is a sitting president literally desiring the failure of our healthcare system. Also, notice that Trump has stopped saying that the Affordable Care Act  is imploding  and is instead now saying that it  will explode.  It sounds like Trump just admitted that the Affordable Care Act was not crumbling as he previously claimed. Now he is just making a prediction.Of course, Twitter users responded by humiliating Trump for failing to gut the Affordable Care Act and torched him for hoping that healthcare fails in America.@realDonaldTrump To be clear: Trump s plan at this point is to try to slowly degrade health care then blame the ACA.

 WATCH: Conservative Group BRAINLESSLY Ran These Ads Cheering Trumpcare AFTER It Died,"Trump and the House GOP suffered a stunning defeat on legislation they promised would deliver better healthcare to millions, despite that promise being a lie. They pulled the Trumpcare bill from the floor early Friday afternoon, before getting a vote, because they knew it wouldn t pass. And that was absolutely humiliating for them.But what may be more humiliating is what the American Action Network a conservative PAC did on Friday night   the exact same day the bill failed. During Friday night basketball games, they ran television ads about the triumph of Trumpcare over Obamacare, saying the following: Republicans are keeping their promise with a new plan for better hrealthcare, More choices and lower costs, putting doctors and patients in charge again. No more big government penalties or job killing mandates. They go on to explain that the tax credits contained within Trumpcare would make healthcare more affordable, and that protections for people with pre-existing conditions would remain in place (which wasn t necessarily true).And then they do something truly amazing, given that these ads ran long after all the drama from the bill s death had quieted down. Watch one of these ads below:Why didn t they have these pulled? That just makes them look completely moronic.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,25-Mar-17
 WATCH: Fox Host Declares GOP Trumpcare Failure A Victory For President Obama,"President Obama has finally been vindicated after seven years of Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act resulted in humiliating failure on Friday.Once again, Republicans were forced to cancel a floor vote for their Trumpcare bill the day after previously pulling it because many Republicans couldn t bring themselves to vote for such a terrible piece of legislation.The bill would have repealed the Affordable Care Act, stripping healthcare from over 20 million Americans and causing healthcare premiums to skyrocket.Donald Trump, of course, immediately blamed Democrats for the defeat even though Republicans control the House, Senate, and the White House.In short, Republicans only have themselves to blame because they are the ones who tried to replace the Affordable Care Act with a plan that was just awful and universally opposed across the country.Adding insult to injury, Fox News anchor Bret Baier forcefully pointed out that while Republicans went down in flames, President Obama won the day. Let me just say one thing, the biggest winner today: President Barack Obama, who came out this week and defended his legacy healthcare law,  Baier began.  It is now clear that Republicans cannot do, at least yet, what they planned on doing in the campaign, after campaign from 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016,  repeal and replace  was the mantra. Indeed, Republicans rehearsed their repeal of the Affordable Care Act incessantly, holding over 60 useless symbolic votes over the years. But when push came to shove, Republicans demonstrated that they are incapable of governing even when they control every branch of government. Barack Obama has the win right now, and it has changed the entire way that we look at healthcare,  Baier continued.  It is now the Democrats  version, the ideology, that government does have a role in providing healthcare in some way shape or form. Thousands of Americans across the country showed up at town halls to confront Republicans in defense of the Affordable Care Act and only 17 percent of Americans approved of their bill.And in the end, not enough Republicans were willing to commit political suicide by supporting the bill and decided to stand against it instead.In conclusion, Baier echoed Fox Business host Stuart Varney by noting that Republicans control Congress and the White House but still could not get anything done. The repeal, drag it up by the root has not worked,  Baier said.  They can t get it through a Republican House, a Republican Senate and a Republican president. Today is a win for President Barack Obama. Here s the video via YouTube.Americans should remain vigilant, however, and continue to watch Republicans closely to make sure they don t try to sneak the bill through. Just like the Affordable Care Act failed a few times before it passed, the GOP could always bring up their terrible bill again for another vote. It will be up to each and every one of us to make sure they fail again. But for now, the Affordable Care Act is the law and Republicans should accept that and get over it.Featured image via Pete Souza",News,24-Mar-17
 RNC Paid TENS of THOUSANDS To Intel Firm With MASSIVE Russian Ties To Dig Up Dirt On Hillary,"During the campaign cycle, payments from the Republican National Committee to this company called the Hamilton Trading Group drew some attention because the RNC said they were payments for an assessment of building security at RNC headquarters in Washington and it looked unusual on a financial disclosure form. That was the RNC s story, as well as that of Hamilton s co-founder, Ben Wickham, and they stuck to it.Until recently. Most of the $41,500 the RNC paid to Hamilton actually went towards intelligence-gathering for the purpose of digging up dirt on Hillary Clinton. Wickham, an ex-CIA officer, insisted at the time that his work was entirely for building security, but now he s saying that he  wasn t totally forthcoming  because the dirt-digging they did was protected under a non-disclosure agreement.The big kicker is that Hamilton has strong connections in Russia. They ve done background checks and provided security services for American companies and officials   work that was done by an ex-KGB agent. According to Wickham, Gennady Vasilenko has  very good contacts in Russia.  However, he also claims never to have had any contact with Donald Trump, Paul Manafort, or any of their people, and that their work has nothing to do with Russia itself.We re pretty sure at this point that Russia hacked the DNC and began releasing batches of documents and emails that were damaging to the DNC for the purpose of helping Trump and harming Hillary. That the RNC worked with a company, which has its own ties to Russia, to build two dossiers on Hillary that supposedly showed she intervened on behalf of energy companies that had donated to the Clinton Foundation in both Israel and Bulgaria just compounds their growing  Russia problem. Trump has people on his team in the White House that have their own ties to Russia. House Intel chair Devin Nunes may have his own ties. Now the RNC itself admits to paying a company with heavy connections to Russia to dig up dirt on Hillary Clinton during the election. This has been out of control for a long time.Featured image by Justin Sullivan via Getty Images",News,24-Mar-17
 Schumer Goes ALL IN On ‘Incompetent’ Trump White House After Healthcare Bill Fails,"The Republican Party and the Trump White House just suffered a humiliating defeat as their signature campaign promise   to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act immediately   couldn t even pass a vote on the House floor with a large GOP majority.Of course, this is a major victory for Democrats, and a political disaster for Republicans. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wasted no time in blasting the Republicans  inability to govern, and the Trump White House in particular. In a press conference shortly after the bill failed, Schumer said: The TrumpCare bill failed because of two traits that have plagued the Trump presidency since he took office: incompetence and broken promises.  I have never seen an administration as incompetent as the one occupying the White House. Schumer went on to openly mock Trump s own claim to fame   deal-making. He snarked,  so much for the art of the deal,  referencing Trump s famous book. Schumer went on to say that Trumpcare should be abandoned in favor of fixing Obamacare: They should depart the field, cut their losses and abandon their quixotic attempt to pass TrumpCare once and for all. Schumer then reminded Republicans that he is willing to work with them on a fix for Obamacare, but will not be helping them to repeal anything to do with the Affordable Care Act: What we said, we stand by. If they would denounce repeal .then we ll work with them on improving [ObamaCare] and making it better. But they can t continue to want to repeal. Schumer went on to remind everyone of a truth that we see every time Republicans are in power: They are very good at criticizing. They re not very good at governing. Schumer also waved away Trump s pathetic attempt to blame Democrats for the bill s failure, and even went so far as to essentially call him a liar: It s another one of his big tall tales. He couldn t get enough Republican votes, he never tried to reach out to Democrats in any way. So the blame falls with president trump and with the Republicans. Indeed. They know how to be against things, how to try and pass draconian laws that are way outside the mainstream opinion of the American people. But when it comes to actually making lives better and making government work, they haven t a clue.Thanks for your candor, Senator Schumer. We need voices like yours right now.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,24-Mar-17
 Trump Goes Ballistic Following His AHCA Defeat: The REAL Losers ‘Are Pelosi And Schumer!’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump drew a line in the sand: Pass the Obamacare repeal and replace bill or else.Then it blew up in his face. Republicans created a bill so unpopular that he couldn t even get it to pass the House. Trump told them to pass the bill anyway   and Republicans ignored him. The legendary  dealmaker  failed spectacularly. So  he s blaming Democrats.In a presser held shortly after he and Paul Ryan agreed to pull the bill rather than face a humiliating defeat during voting, Trump said this outcome was actually  better  than passing the bill because now the Affordable Care Act will collapse on its own. If that reeks of desperation, it only got worse from there. Just two minutes in, Trump claimed the failure of this Republican bill made Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer the real  losers. That is an astounding amount of deflection.FULL REMARKS: @POTUS on the GOP health care bill, which has been pulled. https://t.co/XSqXSToBHV pic.twitter.com/RiIhIA7N35  Fox News (@FoxNews) March 24, 2017 Now they own Obamacare. They own it. 100% own it. This is not Republican healthcare. This is not anything but Democrat healthcare. They have Obamacare for a little bit longer until it ceases to exist, which it will at some point in the near future. The fact that Democrats  own  Obamacare isn t exactly breaking news. They ve  owned  it for seven years, and in the meantime, the president whose name is on it was re-elected in a landslide. It seems unlikely that Schumer or Pelosi are particularly worried about the ACA being seen as  Democrat healthcare.  The healthcare bill is currently at its most popular point ever.Despite Republican lawmakers  efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, a new survey shows that support for the health care law has reached an all-time high.According to the Pew Research Center which conducted the poll, 54 percent of 1,503 adults surveyed between February 7 and 12 approve of the law while 43 percent disapprove.As ever, Trump is showing the country that he has an inability to accept responsibility for his actions. When he strikes out, he blames everyone but himself. It s the judges. It s the  illegal  voters. It s the media. It s the Democrats. It s never  Donald J. Trump, epic buffoon.

 Authors Of Failed GOP Bill Which Would Have Kicked 24 Million Off Insurance Reportedly ‘Near Tears’,"The authors of the Republican bill that would have caused as many as 24 million people to lose health insurance and bankrupt countless others are reportedly  near tears  and  demoralized  following the bill s failure to make it through the house.Guys who wrote this bill are in shock. A couple darn near tears. They know how bad this is.  Mike DeBonis (@mikedebonis) March 24, 2017Republicans supporting this bill were looking forward to the massive tax cuts it gave to millionaires and the major slashes to things like Medicaid and Planned Parenthood. Paul Ryan, the bill s biggest supporter, remarked that he had been dreaming of gutting health care since he was  drinking at a keg  in college. So close to that goal, he looked tired and defeated at a press conference held immediately after the bill s implosion. He admitted that the Affordable Care Act is likely here to stay.Ryan s bedraggled look led to at least one epic joke at his expense:Texas Republican Jodey Arrington was equally crestfallen.The lone Texas Republican freshman, Rep Jodey Arrington, backed the bill and is incredibly demoralized. Quotes to come  Abby Livingston (@TexasTribAbby) March 24, 2017And Rep Mike Conaway decided the most optimistic thing he could say about the day was that he wasn t dead.Rep Mike Conaway is clearly disappointed but does have this reminder: ""Any time you're on this side of the dirt, it's a good day.""  Abby Livingston (@TexasTribAbby) March 24, 2017Twitter users weren t exactly sympathetic to these heartbroken Republicans. The bill was a complete mess and would have caused immeasurable harm. Trump himself seemed to have absolutely no idea what was in the bill and didn t seem to care. The GOP was poised to pass the bill despite these drawbacks for purely political gamesmanship. Still obsessed with their irrational hatred of Obama, they even scheduled the vote to be on the 7th anniversary of Obamacare.@mikedebonis Imagine being moved to tears that your attempt to kill poor people slowly didn't work out.

 Paul Ryan Admits Obamacare Will Be Law ‘For The Foreseeable Future’ After GOP Bill FAILS (VIDEO),"Well, folks, your health care is safe for the  foreseeable future  according to Speaker Paul Ryan. After the GOP abruptly pulled their healthcare bill from consideration Friday, spirits among the worst among us were pretty dim. We just pulled it,  Donald Trump told the Washington Post after the decision to nix the embarrassing disaster of a bill, noting that he doesn t  blame  Ryan for this huge loss. Moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains. We re feeling those growing pains today,  Ryan told reporters, noting that  this is a disappointing day  for those whose biggest dream is stripping healthcare from millions and that  doing big things is hard. All of us, all of us   myself included   will need to time to reflect on how we got to this moment,  he added.How we got to this moment is that the Affordable Care Act is immensely popular. While it could use some improvements   like a move toward universal healthcare   the GOP s effort to  repeal and replace  is not as popular with voters as it may have seemed on the campaign trail.But they won t actually reflect on that, will blame Obama, and will present Americans with something equally horrible somewhere down the line.Ryan was forced to utter one of the most beautiful 22 words we have heard since Donald Trump was kinda-sorta elected by less than half of the population: ObamaCare will remain the law of the land until it s replaced. We re going to be living with ObamaCare for the foreseeable future. The president gave his all in this effort. He did everything he possibly could to help people see the opportunity we have with this bill. He really has been fantastic,  Ryan said. Still, we have to do better and we will. This battle is won. The Affordable Care Act is safe for now. But the war is far from over, and all of us must fight each day to oppose the GOP s hateful agenda.The only thing standing between them and the destruction of all we hold dear is us.Watch Ryan s shamed admission below:""Obamacare is the law of the land and it will remain the law of the land until it's replaced,"" Speaker Ryan says: https://t.co/Okz2bwUl4f pic.twitter.com/9F3MnW7oMR  CBS News (@CBSNews) March 24, 2017Featured image via screengrab",News,24-Mar-17
 GOP In CHAOS As Obamacare Vote Goes Down In Flames (DETAILS),"The entire Republican Party spent the 2016 campaign season running on a promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. However, now that they have the House, the Senate, and the White House, they re like a dog who caught a car it s been chasing for years, and they can t agree on what to do.This entire week has been spent with party members bickering amongst themselves, and many members of the GOP House Conference in open revolt against Paul Ryan s repeal and replace bill. In fact, the bill was so terrible and would cost so many people their health coverage, that even Donald Trump wouldn t put his name on it. The White House has openly said not to dub the plan  Trumpcare. Well, it seems that for now, there will be no Obamacare repeal. In fact, there won t even be a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has pulled the bill because it seems it became clear Friday afternoon that they would not have the votes to get this mess of a healthcare reform bill past the House, much less past the Senate. Of course, this comes just one day after Trump gave House Republicans an ultimatum: Either hold a vote or there will be no Obamacare repeal on his watch, period.That really should come as no surprise, given Trump s low level of patience, short attention span, and penchant for throwing tantrums. He also reportedly said to those voting  No,  on the bill,  I m gonna come after you.  So, who really knows what will come of the relationship between the White House and Congress after this; after all, it was already just a lukewarm marriage of convenience.Well, we ve given the GOP a chance to govern. They have all three branches of the federal government. And they have instead descended into utter chaos in 60 days flat, have been fielding scandal after scandal, and have gotten nothing done. Time to give it back to the Democrats, because it s clear that the Republicans can t handle it.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,24-Mar-17
 Ivanka Trump Gets BURIED By People Calling Her Out For Letting Her Dad Kill Women’s Healthcare,"Ivanka Trump is catching hell right now for being a hypocrite when it comes to women s healthcare.In 2016, Ivanka Trump campaign for her dad by claiming that his administration would support a variety of women s issues including maternity leave.However, Donald Trump s desperate effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act would wipe out maternity care, mammograms, contraception, and would make the cost of healthcare for women skyrocket because insurance companies would be allowed to once again classify being a woman as a pre-existing condition.In short, for all of Ivanka s claims that her dad will be a champion for women, he is proving her to be a total liar. And what s worse is that she is doing nothing to stand up for women.And that s why Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards called out Ivanka on Friday and warned her not to betray women. It s time for Ivanka to   stand for women,  Richards said before calling Ivanak s silence on the bill  deafening. Currently, Ivanka is on a swanky ski trip in Aspen while Republicans prepare to gut healthcare for millions of women across the country. This is going to be a catastrophe for women in this country,  Richards continued.  Any woman who votes for this bill is betraying every woman in America. Women will lose not just their healthcare, but lose their lives over this bill. Here s the video via YouTube.Ivanka s refusal to help women by standing up to her dad has also created a firestorm on her Twitter feed as even more people called her out on social media for being a hypocrite in response to her praise of a paid leave speech delivered by actress Anne Hathaway.@IvankaTrump Now that you ve got an office in the West Wing, how about you stand up for women in the current healthcare discussion?

 WATCH: Hell Freezes As Fox News Host Calls Republican Party A ‘Disgrace’ For Being Incapable Of Governing,"Things just went from bad to worse for the Republican Party.Being in charge just isn t what Republicans imagined it would be like.After all, they have majority control of the House and Senate and have the perfect puppet in the White House to rubber stamp their destructive agenda.But millions of angry Americans across the country, including Democrats, Republicans, and independents, have made Republicans in Congress incredibly nervous about the GOP healthcare bill. Nervous enough to actually oppose it.The Trumpcare bill would strip healthcare away from 20 million Americans and cause premiums to skyrocket, both of which Donald Trump promised would not happen. In short, he lied, and many Republicans don t want to commit political suicide with him.The Republican failure to pass their terrible bill is good for the American people, but it s politically harmful to the GOP because their failure to pass their own bill despite having majority control makes them look incompetent of governing.Keep in mind that Republicans have insisted for years that they are more capable of governing the United States than Democrats. But when Americans actually put them in charge of the entire government it turns out Republicans were all talk and no walk.Rather than govern, Republicans have let Trump systematically destroy this country and now they have failed miserably in their first effort to pass a major policy on their agenda.And even Fox News is disgusted by how Republicans have performed.During his show on Fox Business on Friday, stalwart Republican cheerleader Stuart Varney literally called the entire Republican Party a  disgrace  and conceded that  they can t govern,  much to the surprise of Juan Williams. I personally believe at this moment in time, the Republican Party is a disgrace,  Varney declared.  I m serious. I am serious. We elected the Republicans to run the House, the Senate and the White House and the very, very first thing that comes up on the legislative agenda they vote no, they re split. They can t do it. They can t govern. I am really fit to be tied. Varney invited Williams to take shots at him and the GOP but he declined to do so, opting instead to point out that the Republicans who oppose this bill are doing so because it s a bad bill.Here s the video via YouTube:Indeed, the bill is not better than the Affordable Care Act. In fact, it kills all of the good things the Affordable Care Act provides and takes America back to a time when the uninsured rate was shockingly high and people had to choose between paying for healthcare or paying their bills to avoid homelessness and starvation.But Republicans only have themselves to blame what the position they are in right now. Rather than supporting a law that includes many Republican ideas such as an individual mandate, they chose to viciously oppose the law instead and demonize it for political gain. Furthermore, they had seven years to come up with a better healthcare plan and couldn t even do that. More Americans now understand that the Affordable Care Act was not the evil Republicans portrayed it to be and they now want to save it. Americans are learning about all the good things Republicans would be destroying by repealing it.And now even Fox News is having a hard time defending Republicans on this issue. And losing the support of their propaganda machine should signal to Republicans that they have royally f*cked up.Featured image via screenshot",News,24-Mar-17
 Democrats Offer Bill That Would FORCE Trump To Keep One Of His Promises,"The vast majority of Donald Trump s campaign promises were both unworkable and, well, hateful. His promise to  lock (Hillary Clinton) up,  was as empty as it was unifying for those on the rabid right. It was the same with his promise to build a wall along the Mexican border and his promise to  repeal and replace  Obamacare on day one. Occasionally, though, like a broken clock, Trump occasionally got it right, and now Democrats want him to make good on one such promise.Despite the fact that nearly everything Trump adorns with his name is made elsewhere, one of the cornerstones of his presidential campaigns was to force manufacturers to employ Americans.Republicans are doing everything in their power to ensure that Trump doesn t get to keep this campaign promise. There s a bill in the Senate that would help deliver clean water to Americans and help Flint, Michigan with emergency funding. Originally, there was a  buy American and hire American  provision in the bill. That should be non-controversial, right? Well, Republicans, who seem to stand against absolutely everything that s good and right, stripped that part out of the bill back in December. Now Dems want them to bring it back.Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis) reintroduced the provision to the bill:Dem senator to reintroduce #BuyAmerica legislation @thehill https://t.co/uRuOOH9Bbg  Sen. Tammy Baldwin (@SenatorBaldwin) March 24, 2017 Now is the time for President Trump to decide if he will keep his promises by supporting this legislation, or will he go along to get along with Congressional Republicans who have embraced the status quo and blocked this legislation that puts in place a strong Buy America standard,  said Baldwin, who planned to announce the bill at a Wisconsin foundry that makes manhole covers for cities throughout the United States.  The choice for the Republican establishment in Washington is clear: Do you stand with American manufacturers and workers or do you support spending taxpayer dollars on Chinese and Russian steel for American water infrastructure projects? Source: IB TimesDem senator to reintroduce #BuyAmerica legislation @thehill https://t.co/uRuOOH9Bbg  Sen. Tammy Baldwin (@SenatorBaldwin) March 24, 2017Baldwin s bill deals with the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which in the last two decades has delivered nearly $28 billion in financing for more than 12,000 drinking-water projects across the country. Her legislation would mandate that moving forward, the program targets its funding to projects that use only American-made iron and steel.It s unlikely the bill will pass with this provision, but it does put Trump s feet to the fire. If he signs the Republican version (which he almost certainly will), it will be just more evidence that the emperor has no clothes.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,24-Mar-17
 WATCH: Rachel Maddow Laughs At Republican Effort To Pass Universally Hated Trumpcare Bill,"House Republicans failed to pass their disastrous healthcare bill on Thursday and Rachel Maddow hilariously mocked them for it.Due to the deep unpopularity of the legislation, Republican leadership decided to cancel the vote on the bill at the last minute rather than see it get humiliatingly defeated.Many Republicans are leaning against the bill because it fails to lower premiums and would strip healthcare away from over 20 million Americans, many of whom are conservatives who rely on the Affordable Care Act, which actually does keep premiums lower and covers more people.Under the Trumpcare bill, senior citizens would have to pay nearly ten times as much money on healthcare than what they currently pay under the Affordable Care Act. And since senior citizens are a major voting block for the GOP for some reason, Republicans are backing away from the bill.Of course, Republicans have been rehearsing the repeal of the Affordable Care Act for years, holding over 60 separate votes in the House over the years just to make their conservative base happy. But now that more people understand what the Affordable Care Act actually has done, they are fiercely opposing any repeal effort.Rachel Maddow noted the angry crowds of constituents at Republican town halls and pointed out with a laugh that the GOP bill is more unpopular than despised New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the universe, including our weird politics. A day after the election, nobody would have told you that Republicans would have any trouble repealing Obamacare. That s what they could do on their own, they d push on an open door. The Affordable Care Act, they d been rehearsing repealing it for years. It would definitely be their first casualty, no problem. Then they d get on to the hard stuff. But people all over the country in every congressional district in the country changed the course of that otherwise inevitable history.The Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act has a 17 percent approval rating. That s worse than Chris Christie. There is not a single Congressional district in this country where the number of people who like the Republican idea out-number the people who strongly hate the Republican idea. Not in a single Congressional district. That happens for a reason. That political climate doesn t exist in nature, it is created by people engaged in political action. Maddow concluded the 2-minute segment by reminding everyone that Republicans failed to pass their bill despite having majority control of the House and said it s all thanks to people who have added their voices to the chorus of those opposed to killing a law that actually helps people. For the people who have been trying to save the Affordable Care Act all over the country, even what just happened tonight is huge,  Maddow said.  Everybody thought Republicans would be able to move at will on this but people said nope. Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump s healthcare plan would literally kill people in this country and that s not right. It s inhumane. It forces people to choose between getting medical care or not going bankrupt and that s morally wrong. Healthcare is a human right and it s a need that no one should be priced out of having.If Republicans somehow ram this legislation down our throats they should be brutally punished for it. Because any lawmaker who supports something that kills people is not someone who should be in public office.Featured image via screenshot",News,24-Mar-17
 Adam Schiff SAVAGES Republicans For Canceling Hearing On Russia Collusion To Please Trump,"If you were unaware, there was a much-anticipated hearing on the collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence operatives during the election scheduled on Tuesday   key word  was. Because The Donald totally has nothing to hide at all, the GOP nixed those plans. The public hearing was to feature former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who was fired by Trump for doing her job, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper   both of whom are figures Republicans do not want to allow near a microphone.Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff announced on Friday that Trump transition team member and chairman of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Rep. Devin Nunes canceled the hearing.BREAKING: Chairman just cancelled open Intelligence Committee hearing with Clapper, Brennan and Yates in attempt to choke off public info.  Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) March 24, 2017Schiff also criticized Nunes for running a  dead of night excursion  for documents related to surveillance of Trump associates while leaving the rest of the committee  in the dark. We strongly object to the cancellation of this hearing,  Schiff says.  We would still urge the majority to reconsider. The witnesses have made it clear to us they are still available and we would urge that that hearing be allowed to go forward. Recently, Nunes gave us a clear indicator that he is compromised when he ran directly to The Donald with alleged information showing that information regarding Trump and his team was perfectly legally incidentally collected while intelligence agencies were monitoring some pretty nasty people overseas. He did not share this information with his fellow Congressmen and women.There is no question now. There is no defense.

 SPINELESS: Paul Ryan Actually RAN AWAY From Reporters After Trumpcare FAIL (VIDEO),"Everyone knows Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has absolutely no backbone, but what he did yesterday was an entirely new low for the Republican Party.Yesterday was a disaster for the GOP to begin with. Donald Trump pathetically failed to gain enough votes for the disastrous American Health Care Act, and the GOP suffered a major humiliation as the glorious plan they ve been promising to implement and do away with Obamacare with for the past seven years deteriorates before their eyes. After such a horrible, embarrassing day, it was clear that Ryan didn t have it in him to face the press and answer the many critical questions that Americans have about Trumpcare.Ryan emerged from the failed discussions over Trumpcare, visibly frustrated and not in the mood to make nice with reporters. He gave a short statement in which he was clearly angry and uncomfortable: For seven and a half years, we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it s collapsing and it s failing families, and tomorrow we re proceeding. He ended his address abruptly, literally running off and away from reporters demanding answers. You can watch this disgusting behavior below, courtesy of the Rachel Maddow Show: This is clearly a sign that the GOP knows how badly they ve just failed, and they re aware of how pathetic the party looks right now. This could not be a more painful time for the GOP   their disastrous reality television star of a candidate won the election and even though he s only been in the White House a little more than two months, he s f*cked things up more than anyone thought he would. With Trump s help, the Republican Party has done irreversible damage to its reputation   and they only have themselves to thank. Ryan s cowardly behavior only solidifies the fact that the GOP is crumbling before our very eyes.Featured image via screenshot",News,24-Mar-17
 WATCH: Trump’s Head Will Explode With Rage When He Hears What Lawrence O’Donnell Said About Him,"MSNBC host Lawrence O Donnell did not hold back on Thursday night.Earlier in the day, House Republican leadership saw the writing on the wall and canceled the vote on their healthcare bill.So far, 27 Republicans are leaning against the legislation it does nothing that Donald Trump promised it would do like lower premiums and cover everyone.Indeed, the bill would make premiums skyrocket uncontrollably and would strip healthcare from over 20 million Americans. Senior citizens would suffer the brunt of the financial pain as they would would be charged ten times as much for health insurance under the bill than they are under the Affordable Care Act, which really has made health insurance more accessible and affordable.But after the vote in the House was canceled, Trump lashed out at House Republicans and demanded that a vote be taken on the bill on Friday because he refuses to negotiate any longer on it.So during his show on Thursday night, Lawrence O Donnell took Trump to the woodshed for quitting and noted that President Obama never quit trying to get the Affordable Care Act passed. If you are a House Republican and this is a tough vote for you, the president is saying to you on the front page of the New York Times tomorrow,  I quit, and I quit in the Senate. I do not have the patience or the ability to stay focused on this and get it through the Senate,  which is much harder than getting it through the House. O Donnell is absolutely right. Senate Republicans are even more concerned about the Trumpcare legislation. If passed, the damage will even touch their own voter base, which could result in the Senate flipping back to the control of the Democrats. The Senate is much more vulnerable to being lost than the House is since Republicans have guaranteed control of the House through gerrymandering.But O Donnell had even stronger words for Trump just a few seconds later. This is the laziest, most ignorant president in history,  O Donnell declared.  President Obama never once said something like this in the crusade to get that thing passed because he knew how to stay with it and get it passed. Here s the video via YouTube:Trump is throwing a fit because he expects Congress to ass whatever he wants them to pass and it just doesn t work that way. The Congressional Budget Office analysis of the bill was disastrous for the GOP. And the bill is hated more by Americans than the Affordable Care Act ever was. And thousands of their constituents have showed up at Republican town halls across the country to express their anger over their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.In the end, letting this bill die is probably the best move Republicans can make unless, of course, they propose replacing the Affordable Care Act with universal healthcare. But we all know that will never happen even though it would cover everyone and bring the cost of healthcare down dramatically.One thing is certain, though. When Donald Trump hears what O Donnell just said about him his head is going to explode.Featured image via screenshot",News,24-Mar-17
" Woman CORNERS GOP Senator Trapped On Flight, DEMANDS Explanation To Trumpcare (DETAILS)","A Republican Senator found himself in a tough position when he was trapped on a flight with an American citizen who wanted answers about the disgusting repeal and replacement of Obamacare.Oklahoma resident Kendall Brown noticed that she was on the same flight as Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) on Thursday evening, and decided to take him up on his claim that he would  listen to all voices  if anyone had questions about the GOP s new health care bill. Brown had previously sent letters, emails, and tweets to Lankford, but so far she had been unable to get a response to her questions. However, now that she realized Lankford was trapped on the same airplane with her, she decided this was a great opportunity to get some answers.Once Brown noticed Lankford, she posted a photo of him to her Facebook page, and soon people were begging her to ask him questions. Brown first tried to get Lankford s attention on Twitter, asking him to chat with her about Trump s disastrous plan to repeal and replace Obamacare:  However, Brown still didn t get a response. Twitter users even began to suggest that Brown try to approach him in person. Brown opted to write him a note, and by the time she was finished she must have gotten Lankford s attention because he actually approached her!Lankford asked Brown  specifically  what her question was and she said: I want to share my story with you and I want to have my voice heard on why the ACA is important to me. The conversation ended with an agreement to speak sometime in the near future about the GOP s bill at length.UPDATE: I spoke with @SenatorLankford and gave him this. I m very hopeful we ll be able to get coffee this week & look forward to chatting! pic.twitter.com/AtbRwkJm6P  Kendally Brown ? (@kendallybrown) March 24, 2017While Brown doesn t think Lankford will meet her in person, she hopes they might chat on the phone. She is passionate about addressing her concerns with Lankford, because earlier that day Lankford said in an interview that he would  listen to all voices    something that Brown doesn t think he truly means, considering he hasn t held a town hall on the topic yet. She said: He pretty specifically isn t listening to all voices right now and that s why I approached him. I know there are a lot of people out there that have just as compelling stories about why they need the ACA. So, I had an obligation to approach him, not just for me but for everyone. As Brown s story has gotten more attention, her social media accounts are now full of stories from Americans stating how Obamacare helped them. Brown says she is going to print these stories out and give them to Lankford so he can see how disastrous the repeal and replacement of Obamacare might be.Featured image via Kendally Brown Facebook",News,24-Mar-17

" FBI: After Blocking Trump’s Muslim Ban, Hawaii Judge Inundated With Threats","After a federal court struck down the new version of the Muslim ban (which was basically just like the first one) Donald Trump called it  judicial overreach  at a rally in Nashville, Tennessee, and said that it makes our country look  weak.  And now, the federal judge in Hawaii who ruled against Trump s newest version of a Muslim ban is inundated with threatening messages since the ruling, according to the FBI. Hours before the ban was to go into effect, US District Judge Derrick Watson s ruling resulted in a temporary restraining order nationwide. This was the second time a court ruled against Trump s executive order which resulted in chaos worldwide. Travellers were in mid-flight after the alleged president signed the first one. Protests at airports ensued after people were detained without notice.The FBI did not provide details as to the location the threats are coming from, however, the agency did say they are coming from within the mainland.The U.S. Marshals Service has had to fly in about a dozen deputies from the mainland to provide 24-hour protection for Watson, according to HawaiiNewsNow. The FBI said it will assist the the U.S. Marshals Service if necessary to protect the judge. The illogic of the government s contentions is palpable. The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed,  Watson wrote in the ruling. Trump s own words were used against him in the ruling.Hawaii News Now   KGMB and KHNLThreats against a federal judge or his or her family is a federal crime and is considered obstruction of justice. Trump went on a tweetstorm against the first federal judge who ruled against his travel ban.Even Neil Gorsuch, Trump s Supreme Court nominee who is hoping to take Merrick Garland s stolen seat, called the alleged president s tweets attacking federal judges  disheartening  and  demoralizing.  Still yet, White House press secretary Sean Spicer denied that Gorsuch was referring to Trump.More than one judge has been the target of threats after Trump publicly criticized them. That includes a Seattle judge known for his conservative legal views, who was appointed by George W. Bush.It s clear that Trump is inciting these threats, knowing full well that his die-hard supporters will do his bidding. LOCK HIM UP!Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",News,24-Mar-17
 Trump Just Issued A New But Utterly USELESS Threat On Endangered Trumpcare Bill,"The  American Health Care Plan,  a.k.a. AHCA or  Trumpcare,  didn t get the vote Thursday that it was supposed to because there are too many Republicans in Congress that won t vote for it. Trump has been trying to bully them into doing so, including threatening the jobs of Republicans who vote against it. Now, though, he s made what he no doubt thinks is his most terrifying threat yet, except it s really not.He s threatened to leave Obamacare in place if Trumpcare fails in Congress.If you re sitting there scratching your head, you aren t alone. The ACA, also known as the dreaded Obamacare, would remain in place and intact regardless of what Trump does. The question is who would be responsible for that, politically, and the answer is and has always been Republicans. Trump seems to think he can hold that over their heads to force a vote.Mick Mulvaney, the White House s budget director, has even told House Republicans that Trump is done with negotiations and just wants a vote now. He said that if they vote the bill down, then Trump will just proceed to work on other parts of his agenda. Which, really, is the obvious option.One has to ask: Does Trump really think that he s going to cow intransigent Republicans this way? Should Trumpcare fail, the ACA would remain the law of the land regardless of what Trump does because he can t repeal it all on his own.There are House Republicans that aren t part of the intransigent Freedom Caucus who have said they can t back the modified bill, which is considerably worse than the original bill. There s also the fact that Senate Republicans have already said they don t have the votes to pass Trumpcare.To appease one side, such as the Freedom Caucus, Republicans have to alienate another side, like moderates. They re stuck between a rock and a hard place on this   and it s a situation that Trump s bullying can t really make worse.There s a small chance that the bill will pass the House tomorrow, but with the Freedom Caucus and moderates being unhappy with the bill, it will probably fail. If it fails, Obamacare will remain the law of the land. Republicans already know they ll bear the burden of that. Trump s threat is ridiculous.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,24-Mar-17
 WATCH: Jake Tapper Mocks Republicans HARD On CNN For Humiliating Failure To Pass Trumpcare,"House Republicans had seven years to come up with a plan superior to the Affordable Care Act and their plan is so bad that not even the GOP majority could pass it.After uselessly voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act over sixty times during those years in order to please their conservative base, Republicans appear to be chickening out from actually doing it.Because once the dubiously named American Healthcare Act passes, it would strip health care from over 20 million Americans, many of whom are Republican voters for some reason.The bill would also cause the price of healthcare to skyrocket, especially for senior citizens who would have to pay ten times as much as they do right now under the Affordable Care Act.Anyway, the vote on the Republican bill was scheduled for Thursday, but once Republican leadership realized that they could muster enough members of their own party to get the necessary number of votes, they canceled the vote.Seriously. Republicans control the House and they couldn t even bring up their own bill for an up or down vote. Simply put, it was a humiliating failure of epic proportions.Once Donald Trump found the egg on his face, he immediately demanded that House Republicans vote on Friday. And so we now wait for the moment when Trump suffers a major policy defeat because Republicans discovered that repealing the Affordable Care Act isn t such a great idea after all.Adding to the humiliation on Thursday was CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who pointed out how long Republicans have been having their collective wet-dream about repealing the signature achievement of America s first black president, and then mocked them for failing to do so. It turns out it s a lot easier for Republican leaders to say  repeal and replace  than to do it,  Tapper said. Seven years ago today, the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare was signed into law by President Obama and since that time Republicans have been planning, hoping, dreaming for this day, the moment where they could finally repeal Obamacare and replace it with their own solution to the nation s health care mess. They have had seven years to prepare for this day.Now weeks after optimistic talk from House leaders, declarations from White House secretary Sean Spicer that  the bill will pass the House tonight and there is no Plan B,  well, the bill was in such peril Republican leaders pulled it and postponed the vote. And what critics are calling an  embarrassing and ignominious move,  so humiliating, it signifies the only thing worse would have been to actually bring it to a vote where Republican leaders were apparently confident it would die. Here s the video via YouTube:If this bill fails to pass it will be a humiliating defeat for Trump and Republicans, but it will be a glorious victory for the American people and the millions who rely on the Affordable Care Act to help get and keep accessible and affordable health insurance.So as Friday approaches, Americans need to urge their Republican representatives to vote against the bill. Because if Trump is able to bully the holdouts into voting for it, he can bully them into voting for anything and then America is truly screwed.Featured image via Cagle",News,23-Mar-17
 Meet The Girl Republicans Are Trying Like Hell To Kill (VIDEO),"Republicans are hell bent on repealing Obamacare. They don t care how many people it kills. After eight years of demanding the Affordable Care Act be repealed and replaced, the best they could come up with when they finally won the majority, was a plan that will kick 24 million people off of their health insurance. The proposed bill was especially cruel to the elderly, the sick, and the disabled. Thankfully, the American Health Care Act didn t make it past Thursday s House vote, but only because a significant number of Republicans didn t think it was cruel enough.This is Ashley, and she is one of the many people the Republicans are trying to put into an early grave.A few years ago, when she was only 22 years old, Ashley was diagnosed with Lupus, an autoimmune disease in which the body s own immune system turns on itself and attacks various organs throughout the body. Ashley s case proved to be severe. Among other things, the Lupus has attacked her brain, which causes seizures.Her entire digestive system is paralyzed, a condition called gastroparesis. She is unable to eat or take any medications by mouth because it just sits in her stomach until it is eventually vomited back up several days later. She has had multiple feeding tubes surgically implanted, which allowed liquid nutritional supplements to be delivered directly into her intestines. But in Ashley, the gastroparesis has paralyzed her intestines too.Because of this, Ashley has relied on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for more than two years   in other words, she is fed through an IV. She has had multiple ports installed in her chest over the years, along with a countless number of PICC lines. Anytime you see her, she will have her trusty backpack carrying her TPN pump which feeds her through a tube in her chest from the IV bag she lugs around.Just to make things fun, Ashley s body has decided to develop a blood clotting disorder that doctors have not yet been able to diagnose or identify. She has repeatedly had potentially fatal DVT s over the past few months, including a particularly dangerous one in her neck that developed even after she was placed on high doses of blood thinners.Now that you have a little background, and rest assured that this is only a small snapshot of her overall medical picture, I will get back to my point because this isn t a sob story. Ashley is a fighter and the only thing she needs less than pity is the GOP s  make America sick again  plan.Ashley is alive because West Virginia chose to take part in the Medicaid expansion. Republicans want to gut Medicaid, and West Virginia s budget is already pushed to the max. If there have to be cuts, expensive patients like Ashley will be the first to go and spending caps in the AHCA would do just this. Getting her treatments approved are already a nightmare. If the GOP gets their way, this girl will die. She won t live long enough fight it or look for other options. Without Medicaid, Ashley will die. Period.I would like to think that putting a face on this would compel a little compassion from the right, but Republicans don t give a f*ck about Ashley or any of the other sick Americans they are trying so hard to kill. After all, their only complaint about the GOP plan is that it isn t going to kill enough people.You can watch Ashley talk more about her illness here, via the Invisible Disability Project: Featured image via Facebook",News,23-Mar-17
 Desperate GOP LITERALLY Spreads Trump’s Wiretap Lies To Fleece Their Supporters,"It was bound to happen   as soon as House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes said that he had evidence people in Trump s transition team were recorded during foreign surveillance activities, Trump and his loyal subjects within the Republican Party pounced. Never mind what else Nunes said that the information collected was incidental and probably legal the GOP saw their opportunity to clear their president s name and paint Obama as the evil, criminal, dictatorial president they always  knew  he was.The National Republican Congressional Committee sent out emails this morning with the subject line,  Confirmed: Obama spied on Trump.  They quoted Politico:  Trump transition members were under surveillance during Obama administration.  And they quoted Nunes:  Members of the Donald Trump transition team, possibly including Trump himself, were under surveillance during the Obama administration following November s election. Here s the full letter:Whoa. as flagged by the DCCC, Republicans are now fundraising on the false claim that Obama spied on Trump pic.twitter.com/AKzw3jAAQJ  Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) March 23, 2017Is there context? Of course not. That s nonexistent in their letter, but here s some: The quote from the Politico story is the caption on top of the video they posted of Nunes  press conference. And here s some more relevant context from that story: Nunes set off the firestorm with a news conference earlier in the day in which he described the surveillance of Trump aides through what s called  incidental collection,  something he noted was routine and legal. Such collection can occur when a person inside the United State communicates with a foreign target of U.S. surveillance. In such cases, the identities of U.S. citizens are supposed to be shielded   but can be  unmasked  by intelligence officials under certain circumstances. Furthermore, Nunes himself said: This is a normal, incidental collection, based on what I could collect. It alarms him anyway, for some reason.However, more significant than that is the fact that Nunes also said yesterday that he still has no evidence Trump, his team, or his campaign were wiretapped or otherwise the target of surveillance by the Obama administration. None. Zero, zip, zilch, nada.  I have said this for many, many weeks,  he told White House reporters.What we have now is a party that s actively and knowingly spreading Trump s lies to gain an edge they know they re losing. Should investigations conclude that not only did a sitting president level a demonstrably false accusation against his predecessor, but also that he colluded with Russia during the election cycle, the GOP is sunk.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,23-Mar-17
 Photo Of GOP Meeting To Kill Maternity Care Goes Viral After People Notice Totally Offensive Detail,"In a stunning example of just how out-of-touch and heartless the Republican Party is towards women s healthcare, Vice President Mike Pence convened a meeting to discuss the topic of stripping maternity care requirements from health insurance   and forgot to invite even a single woman.Needless to say, an image of the meeting is now blowing up on social media as Americans sit in stunned amazement that this is how Congress and the White House think of the women who make up half the country.Democratic politicians were equally outraged. Massachusetts Representative Jim McGovern tweeted his anger over the sheer audacity of this meeting.

The bill has been nothing short of a disaster for Republicans. For starters, it keeps many of the items that infuriate conservatives intact, while at the same time doing everything that Obamacare did, but less well. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that over 24 million people would likely lose their health insurance thanks to this bill. For many people, it would also cause their premiums to skyrocket.Rather than fix the bill   or better yet, keep the ACA   Trump and Ryan are making huge concessions to the ultra-right. One such concession is to remove the  health care  part of the health care bill. Republicans are considering dropping the so-called  essential health benefits  of the ACA, allowing insurers to pick and chose what they want to cover. Naturally, things like maternity care and emergency services would be the first to go. Which brings us back to the  House Freedom Caucus  and its all-male members.In a dimly lit room, the group of conservative white men sat around a table and weighed the relative merits of providing maternity care to women. To give one an idea of how dismissive these elderly GOPers were towards giving health care to women, here s how Trump s Press Secretary Sean Spicer framed it:Sean Spicer on healthcare: ""I think if you're an older man you can generally say that you're not going to need maternity care.""

 Trump Supporter Full Of Regret Because Her Undocumented Immigrant Husband Is About To Be Deported,"A woman in Indiana is feeling the pain of Donald Trump s immigration policies personally. Apparently, she believed her family would be exempt because she voted for him.In 1998, Roberto Beristain crossed the southern border of the United States without documents to seek a better life. He found one.He opened a restaurant called Eddie s Steak Shed, fell in love with a woman named Helen, married her, and had four children.Immigration and Customs ignored Roberto and decided not to follow an order to deport him for over a decade. After all, he proved himself to be a model citizen and a productive member of society. Plus, he routinely checked in with ICE.His hypocrite wife, on the other hand, only has herself to blame for what Roberto is going through now.Because of Trump s obsessive anti-immigration crusade, Roberto has now been arrested and is going to be deported on Friday after being in the United States for nearly 20 years.As it turns out, Helen is a Trump supporter. She voted for him because she ironically believes that undocumented immigrants should be deported. However, she seriously bought Trump s claim that he would only deport criminals. The problem is that Trump and his rabid conservative base believe being an undocumented immigrant is a criminal act (it isn t). [Trump] did say the good people would not be deported, the good people would be checked,  Helen whined to Indiana Public Media.Of course, Trump lied. Surprise!Did Helen think that because she supported Trump that his policies for everyone else would not touch her own family? After all, Roberto is an undocumented immigrant and she was warned repeatedly during the 2016 campaign that Trump s immigration policies would even target immigrants who had not committed crimes.It s really hard to sympathize with Helen at this point. She willingly voted for a man who has an open disdain for immigrants and her vote is now coming back to haunt her.One wonders if she will continue supporting Trump after this or will she be yet another of the growing number of Trump supporters who turned their backs on him after they discovered they had been duped?Trump s immigration policies are literally tearing families apart and creating an atmosphere of fear and hate across the nation.This story just further demonstrates that you get what you vote for.Featured image via Jim Lo Scalzo   Pool/Getty Images",News,23-Mar-17
 WATCH: Nancy Pelosi Takes House Intel Chair To The Woodshed For Being A Trump ‘Stooge’,"GOP Rep. Devin Nunes is feeling the burn after Nancy Pelosi ripped him a new one on Thursday.On Wednesday, Nunes went to the White House to personally give information to Donald Trump about the House Intelligence Committee s investigation into his Russia scandal.Nunes claimed that some Trump team members were incidentally caught on surveillance conducted by foreign intelligence and then suggested to the media that Trump s accusation against President Obama was right all along. I guess it all depends on one s definition of spying,  Nunes said during the rushed press conference, which was put together in a desperate effort to defend Trump.Nunes  press conference and his visit to the White House were done without the knowledge of the rest of the committee. Clearly, Nunes went rogue and disgraced himself in the process since he is the chairman of the committee.Furthermore, Nunes  actions make it clear that he s not interested in conducting a fair investigation. He s only interested in helping Trump.And that s why Nancy Pelosi nailed him to the wall. Chairman Nunes is deeply compromised, and he cannot possibly lead an honest investigation,  Pelosi told reporters.  He committed a stunt at the White House yesterday raising questions about Chairman Nunes  impartiality. Pelosi reminded the press that Nunes worked on Trump s transition team so it definitely looks like Nunes is doing Trump s bidding.She then blasted Republicans for desperately saying anything to help Trump. The Republicans are grasping at straws,  Pelosi said.  FBI Director Comey confirmed that President Obama did not wiretap President Trump, affirmed an investigation into links and coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Indeed, Comey dropped these bombshells last week during under oath testimony to Congress. The revelations nuked whatever shred of credibility Trump had left and now charges of treason are hanging over Trump and his administration.But Pelosi wasn t done with Nunes yet. She had even stronger words for him. By being a stooge of the president of the United States, he has demonstrated very clearly that there is no way there can be an impartial investigation under his leadership on that committee,  Pelosi declared. She then went on to call for the creation of an independent commission to continue the investigation.Here s the video via Twitter..@NancyPelosi calls House Intelligence Cmte Chair Devin Nunes a  stooge for the president of the United States  pic.twitter.com/RlqfPA5fNE  CSPAN (@cspan) March 23, 2017It s clear that House Republicans are colluding with Donald Trump to help him discredit the investigation against him. There needs to be an independent commission and a special prosecutor involved. Republicans have zero credibility to do their jobs. Nunes went behind his colleague s backs to deliver information to Trump and then held a hasty press conference. He s a shill for Trump, and this video of Nunes refusing to say whether he got his information from Trump proves it.Republicans are rigging the House Intelligence Committee investigation and something needs to be done about it.Featured image via screenshot",News,23-Mar-17
 President Obama Came Out Of Retirement Today To Slam Republicans On Healthcare,"After two months of an administration that gives literal meaning to the term  bully pulpit,  it becomes easy to forget what a real president sounds like how a real president discusses disagreements. On Thursday, though, we received a brief reminder as President Obama took a break from his retirement to talk about health care and not once did he use the words  fake news  or even  sad. Today is the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act, a law, that despite Republicans  claims otherwise, took months and months to draft, debate and eventually pass. Obama, as well as anyone, knows that the law isn t perfect, but he does recognize some very basic facts, which boil down to we re much better with it than without it. Obama said it better in a statement on Thursday. So the reality is clear: America is stronger because of the Affordable Care Act,  Obama said.He s right. The uninsured rate has been cut almost in half since the law s inception and it goes down every year.Republicans want to change that and Obama didn t let that go. In his very diplomatic style that we so desperately miss, the President urged Republicans to pass a bill that would improve upon the Affordable Care Act, not make it worse. So if Republicans are serious about lowering costs while expanding coverage to those who need it, and if they re prepared to work with Democrats and objective evaluators in finding solutions that accomplish those goals   that s something we all should welcome,  he said.  But we should start from the baseline that any changes will make our health care system better, not worse for hardworking Americans. That should always be our priority.  Only, as we know, Republicans don t give a crap about making the law better, unless by better, you mean giving rich people a huge tax cut while leaving older poor people much, much poorer.Fortunately, the fate of this bill, which will go up for a vote on the anniversary of Obama s signature healthcare law, is uncertain to say the least. At this point, it s far more likely to fail than to pass.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images",News,23-Mar-17
" Reeking Of Desperation, Trump Sends Out ‘Poll’ Asking His Followers To Prove They Love Him","Facing corruption scandals, nepotism scandals, Russian interference in the election scandals, and a healthcare bill that appears to be so awful even Republicans won t touch it, Trump did what comes natural to him  beg his supporters for love.In a poll that has already become the laughingstock of the internet, Trump sent email subscribers a single question meant to  prove the American people stand behind our great movement : Do you stand with President Trump?The answers were hilariously loaded. Poll takers could pick just one of two options:Apparently Trump didn t want people answering the wrong way in a non-scientific poll meant to boost his ego. Leaving nothing to chance, he made the  no  answer an insane screed against Democrats and the media.Actual email sent out by Trump Headquarters pic.twitter.com/8c3qwbNoUb  Molly Crabapple (@mollycrabapple) March 23, 2017Notably, there are already existing polls which are meant to gauge whether the American people support the president or not. They are conducted by legitimate polling organizations. The latest ones show that at this point in his term Trump is perhaps the least popular president of all time.President Donald Trump s job approval rating has dropped to 37%, while 58% of Americans disapprove of his performance so far as president, new Gallup figures show.Naturally, the poll ends with a plea for money.

On Twitter, he s stopped even trying to find legitimate sources for his claims. Now he exclusively tweets out links to disreputable right-wing conspiracy sites. During a TIME magazine interview, Trump ranted about how he is always right and never wrong.The whole thing is getting a disturbing  Hitler s final days in the bunker  vibe to it.

" White Supremacist Kills Black Man, Planned On Murdering More (VIDEO)","James Harris Jackson, 28, eventually surrendered to police in New York City to admit to fatally stabbing a 66-year-old black man in the chest with a 26-inch sword that has an 18-inch blade. The sword exited the victim s back after being plunged into his chest. Jackson, an army veteran from Baltimore, held a long-time hatred of black people and had traveled to Manhattan with the goal of killing black men.This is an attack you won t see amateur president Donald Trump tweeting about.Timothy Caughman, 66, the white supremacist s victim, stumbled into a police station bleeding from stab wounds to his chest and back, Assistant Chief William Aubry, the commander of Manhattan South detectives, told reporters at Police Headquarters, according to the New York Times.After taking down his first victim, Jackson set his sights on another black person just blocks away but something reportedly  spooked him. He appeared to be very close, following a black guy,  a source said.  He slows down and at one point he turned around and came back. It s clear he was really focused on the guy for some time. Then, he falls out of camera view and doesn t attack the guy. He made statements that he was following the guy but something spooked him. Jackson was arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, but the chief said they wanted to upgrade the charge by classifying it a hate crime.Watch:.@NYPDMTS walk James Harris Jackson, an army veteran & member of a hate group in Maryland, accused of killing a #NYC black man @NYDNVideo pic.twitter.com/DWwGxM0GgG  Edgar Sandoval (@edjsandoval) March 22, 2017Surveillance video of Jackson near the scene:Jackson admitted to police that he was a member of a white supremacist group and said that he detailed his racist views on his laptop computer, according to the Daily News.Jackson told the authorities that he initially wanted to stab a black man, then grab a police officer s gun and  shoot some people,  a police source said.Aubry said,  He wanted to make a statement. Jackson told police that he has been  harboring (racist) feelings for quite some time,  and it s believed he had these feelings for over 10 years, police said. He knew what he was doing when he was coming up here,  Aubry said at a press conference.  It is believed he was specifically intending to target male blacks. It s been well over 10 years that he has been harboring his hate towards blacks. Jackson reportedly said he doesn t like interracial relationships.

 Trump’s TIME Interview Is The Most Batsh*t F*cking Insane Thing You’ll Ever See,"Donald Trump at this point is known for spewing crazy statements, but in an interview with TIME, The Donald somehow managed to outdo himself in attempting to defend some of his more batsh*t insane lies.Asked about his claim that President Obama put a  tapp  on his  wires  at Trump Tower, The Donald explained that he has  articles saying it happened.  The random, word salady string of words Trump threw together to support this one is so impressively moronic that Sarah Palin seems like a genius by comparison: No, I have, look. I have articles saying it happened. But you have to take a look at what they, they just went out at a news conference. Devin Nunes had a news conference. I mean I don t know, I was unable to see it, because I am at meetings, but they just had a news conference talking about surveillance. Now again, it is in quotes. That means surveillance and various other things. And the New York Times had a front-page story, which they actually reduced, they took it, they took it the word wiretapping out of the title, but its first story in the front page of the paper was wiretapping. And a lot of information has just been learned, and a lot of information may be learned over the next coming period of time. We will see what happens. Look. I predicted a lot of things that took a little of bit of time. Here, headline, for the front page of the New York Times,  Wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides.  That s a headline. Now they then dropped that headline, I never saw this until this morning. They then dropped that headline, and they used another headline without the word wiretap, but they did mean wiretap. Wiretapped data used in inquiry. Then changed after that, they probably didn t like it. And they changed the title. They took the wiretap word out. Devin Nunes did indeed have a  news conference  in which he did attempt to push Trump s lies by pointing out that many of The Donald s associates had been caught up in perfectly legal  incidental collection  while the FBI and other agencies were looking into foreign suspects. Nunes, a prominent member of Trump s transition team, also completely skipped telling his fellow Russia investigators of this development and ran directly to Mr. 45 with the information.Though Nunes has previously said there is no evidence that Obama  tapped  Trump s  wires,  The Donald took the incidental collection of information   a term he admits he does not understand   as proof that he was correct about that dastardly President Obama: Well, he just got this information. This was new information. That was just got. Members, of, let s see, were under surveillance during the Obama Administration following November s election. Wow. This just came out. So, ah, just came out. Trump also told TIME that he will be  proved right  about his wacky claim that three million undocumented immigrants voted for his opponent, swinging the popular vote in Hillary Clinton s favor. Despite the completely false nature of Trump s allegations, he says he s  forming a committee on it  and it may be  more than  three million   a  serious problem. Asked about his completely unfounded claim that thousands of Muslims celebrated in the streets of New Jersey after 9/11, Trump claimed that it was in the Washington Post. This claim has been disputed by literally everyone with any sense.Trump even defended his blatantly incorrect claim that Ted Cruz s father helped kill JFK by saying it was in a  newspaper.  It wasn t, but that didn t stop him from lying again: Well that was in a newspaper. No, no, I like Ted Cruz, he s a friend of mine. But that was in the newspaper. I wasn t, I didn t say that. I was referring to a newspaper. A Ted Cruz article referred to a newspaper story with, had a picture of Ted Cruz, his father, and Lee Harvey Oswald, having breakfast. In fact, according to The Donald, he is not responsible for any of his lies because someone else made the numerous false claims elsewhere and he simply repeated them: Why do you say that I have to apologize? I m just quoting the newspaper, just like I quoted the judge the other day, Judge Napolitano, I quoted Judge Napolitano, just like I quoted Bret Baier, I mean Bret Baier mentioned the word wiretap. Now he can now deny it, or whatever he is doing, you know. But I watched Bret Baier, and he used that term. I have a lot of respect for Judge Napolitano, and he said that three sources have told him things that would make me right. I don t know where he has gone with it since then. But I m quoting highly respected people from highly respected television networks. This is perhaps the most insane interview conducted with the President of the United States.

" WATCH: McCain Scorches His Own Party’s Sham ‘Investigation,’ Says Congress Is Not Credible In Russia Probe","Arizona Senator John McCain seems to be the lone patriot left in the GOP right now, along with perhaps South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. It seems McCain has had just about enough of the shady shenanigans regarding the so-called  investigation  into the Trump campaign s ties to Russia and possible collusion. During an interview on Wednesday, McCain called for a new, independent commission, saying to Greta Van Susteren on MSNBC: It s a bizarre situation, and what I think, the reason why I m calling for this select committee or a special committee, is I think that this back-and-forth and what the American people have found out so far that no longer does the Congress have credibility to handle this alone. And I don t say that lightly. These tough remarks come as things heat up on Capitol Hill regarding Russia, with the Republican Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes (R-CA), and the Ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff (D-CA), now openly feuding over how things are being handled. This is especially true since Nunes decided to brief Trump   the very subject of this investigation   before briefing his own committee.It s high time the rest of the Republican Party grew a pair and put country before party and put a stop to this nonsense. Impeach Trump, investigate his entire administration, and if/when criminal wrongdoing is found, prosecute them.Watch the video below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,23-Mar-17
 WATCH: Oklahoma Republican Declares That Rape Is The ‘Will Of God’,"Women should get as far away from Oklahoma as soon as possible because Christian Sharia law is about to make their lives a living hell.If Oklahoma state GOP Rep. George Faught has his way, rape will be on the path to being legal in the state. At least that s what rapists are hoping for after Faught made a frightening statement on the subject during a debate on House Bill 1549, which restricts abortion.Democratic Rep. Cory Williams masterfully cornered Faught during the hearing by asking him if he believes rape and incest are the  will of God  since the legislation has no exceptions for either, meaning women would be forced to give birth to their rapist s baby.Faught s reply is absolutely appalling and demonstrates once again why women should never vote for Republicans, especially Republicans who want to base our laws on the Bible. Well, you know, if you read the Bible, there s actually a couple circumstances where that happened,  Faught said.  The Lord uses all circumstances. I mean, you can go down that path, but it s a reality unfortunately. Faught literally just used the Bible to justify rape. And then he used it to justify incest. Same answer,  Faught replied. Then he argued that Williams  questions have nothing to do with the bill. Williams vehemently disagreed and explained why. You are proffering a divine intervention as the reason why you won t do that and so I think it is very important,  Williams said before demanding Faught repeat his answer again.  This body wants to know   and myself personally   whether you believe rape and incest are actually the will of God. Faught obliged and stated that rape and incest are God s will because God is sovereign over all activities that happen. It s a great question to ask. And, obviously if it happens in someone s life, it may not be the best thing that ever happened, but   so you re saying that God is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someone s life and can t use anything and everything in someone s life and I disagree with that. Seriously.Here s the video via YouTube.This is exactly the same kind of statement that Republicans like Rick Santorum and Richard Mourdock made during the 2012 Election. I believe and I think the right approach is to accept this horribly created   in the sense of rape   but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you,  Santorum said during his run for the presidency.  As you know, we have to, in lots of different aspects of our life. We have horrible things happen. I can t think of anything more horrible. But, nevertheless, we have to make the best out of a bad situation. I ve struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize that life is that gift from God,  Mourdock said during his Senate run in Indiana. And even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen. Both of these assholes think that rape is sanctioned by God and that women should appreciate the  gift  God is giving them by force. It s disgusting and is the reason why both men lost their races.And now Faught should be ousted from office as well.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,22-Mar-17
 WATCH: Hawaii Republican Leaves Party After GOP Leadership Punishes Her For Criticizing Trump,"Democrats are about to welcome another voice into their big tent after Republicans in Hawaii decided their tent wasn t small enough.In January, Hawaii state Rep. Beth Fukumoto attended the Women s March in protest of Donald Trump. As an American, Fukumoto has every right to exercise her freedom of speech and right to protest.But Republicans in the state decided that a woman s place is not in the Republican Party if she won t submit to Trump.So they stripped Fukumoto of her leadership position in the statehouse and tried to force her to resign simply because she criticized Trump.Republicans also condemned Fukumoto because she dared to work with Democrats on legislation to benefit the people of Hawaii.Fukumoto refused to be bullied by her sexist and racist colleagues and continued to represent her constituents. And now, after a couple months of thought, Fukumoto has decided to ditch the GOP to become a Democrat. When I joined the Republican Party eight years ago, I did so with a group of people my age who were full of hope, ideas and energy,  Fukumoto said.  I discovered that it wasn t just me and my Republican friends trying to change the status quo. There were good Democrats trying to change things too. So we started working together. But, in doing so, I ran into Republican partisanship that insisted I stop working with Democrats even when it clearly benefited our community. In a video explaining her decision, Fukumoto said that some constituents think she should stick it out in the GOP and be a voice of opposition from within. However, she would rather join the Democrats and actually get things done. I want to be productive,  she said.  I could stay. I could continue to criticize. I could be that voice of opposition, but what good does that do for the people of Hawaii, and what good does that do for my district? I think there s a much better opportunity that if I disagree with what the Republican Party is doing, to be able to work productively as a Democrat to offer a different solution, so that s what I m announcing today. Here s the video via KHON2.Indeed, what s the point of staying in a party that hates you? Ultimately, Fukumoto made the best decision by joining a party that actually appreciates her voice and ideas. Meanwhile, Republicans only have themselves to blame because they are so blinded by their loyalty to Trump that they literally let a woman who wanted to be part of the party s future become part of the Democratic Party instead.Once again, Republicans clearly demonstrated that women, especially women who criticize Trump, are not welcome in their party.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,22-Mar-17
 BOMBSHELL: Devin Nunes’ Entire Net Worth Sunk In Company With Strong Ties To Russia,"If today s fiasco, which came courtesy of House Intel chair Devin Nunes, wasn t enough to convince anyone that he can t conduct a credible investigation into whether or not Trump and his teams colluded with Russia, then this should be: Nunes has put almost his entire net worth into a winery with strong ties to Russia.How strong? Well, the Alpha Omega Winery has distributors all over the U.S., but just a few abroad. One of those overseas distributors is the Luding Trading Company in Russia. Luding is, in fact, Russia s largest distributor for alcoholic beverages. But they don t just operate in Russia   they also appear to have a relationship with Vladimir Putin: The Luding Company and the Yerevan Ararat Brandy-Wine-Vodka factory sent greetings to Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, on his 55th birthday and made a birthday present of bottles of the Noy, the Sovereign 55 cognac and the Vanatur and Varpet unique 1952 vintage wines, 1952 being the President s birth year. If Russia were truly a free, democratic state, then maybe this could be overlooked as nothing more than a large company wishing the leader of a country that had given them so much a happy birthday. But Russia, under Putin, is anything but truly free. With Luding being the country s largest distributor of alcohol, it s highly unlikely that Putin doesn t have his fingers in it somewhere. The fact that Nunes has his money sunk there is a pretty big deal.It s also odd that Alpha Omega Winery would have a relationship with Russia s largest distributor when they only have a relationship with one Western nation (Switzerland). They don t have any relationships with any other distributor in the EU, which means no relationships with NATO allies at all.Then there s the fact that Nunes is one of the people Trump called upon to refute news about the whole Russia scandal. That right there compromised the House s investigation into Trump and Russia because it blurs the lines between the intelligence community, the White House, and Congress.And Nunes actually did what Trump asked him to   he started sending messages to reporters challenging the Russia stories. As the chairman of the committee investigating the Trump-Russia tie, he should never have done that.It appears more and more likely that Nunes was never acting independently in this investigation. And given that he s got business ties to Russia tenuous or not he should have recused himself from this investigation the instant it got underway.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,22-Mar-17
 Trump’s ‘Grab Them By The P***y’ Nature Reappeared During Meeting With Japanese Prime Minister,"Trump s disgusting brand of misogyny was laid bare for all to see during the election cycle and it should have sunk him, because he literally bragged about sexually assaulting women by kissing them without waiting, and also saying women would let him  grab them by the pussy,  because he was famous. If you thought that his being elected would have toned that down, you thought wrong. And he doesn t seem to care who s around when he gets lewd and disgusting like that.Last month, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. These kinds of meetings often require translators, and in this case, the translator was a woman. And Trump couldn t stop thinking about her. From Vanity Fair: [V]intage Trump is not going anywhere anytime soon. A couple of weeks earlier, during a visit by the Japanese prime minister, Shinz  Abe, the president told an acquaintance that he was obsessed with the translator s breasts although he expressed this in his own, fragrant fashion. Seriously, he said, practically right in front of another world leader, that he was obsessed with a woman s breasts. Was his mind even on the meeting or was he just staring at her breasts the whole time?Those comments, which Trump and his loyal subjects dismissed as mere locker room talk, led to men assaulting women on subways and sidewalks, literally yelling,  Grab her by the pussy!  Trump normalized objectifying and assaulting women because hey, if he can do it, then why can t everyone?And he s still at it! Now the question is, how often does this happen while he s meeting with diplomats and world leaders? What about the foreign press? Does he do this all the time, and nobody says anything? He s not just a joke, he s a vile, disgusting pig of a joke.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,22-Mar-17

 BREAKING: Evidence Trump Colluded With Russia Is Now ‘More Than Circumstantial’ (DETAILS),"The Democratic ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee dropped a bombshell Wednesday afternoon when he revealed that there is  more than circumstantial evidence now  of collusion between Donald Trump and Russia.Speaking to MSNBC s Chuck Todd, Rep. Adam Schiff said the evidence that Trump s team colluded with Russia is no longer just circumstantial. On Sunday, Schiff said that there was circumstantial evidence of collusion and direct evidence  of deception, but today, he said there is more.When Todd asked him if the case for collusion was only circumstantial, Schiff said, I can tell you that the case is more than that. I can t go in to the particulars but there is more than circumstantial evidence now,  Schiff said. You have seen direct evidence of collusion?  Todd asked. I don t want to go into specifics but I will say that there is evidence that is not circumstantial and very much worthy of investigation  Schiff said.This is the furthest a lawmaker has gone regarding proof that Trump was working with Russia to cheat his way into the White House.On Monday, during a hearing before the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed that the bureau is investigation both Russia s interference in the election and the possibility that Trump was in cahoots with Putin the whole time. Comey also testified that this investigation began way back in July of 2016.You can watch Schiff s interview here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,22-Mar-17
 A Liberal Had A Heart Attack; You Need To See The Reactions From The Right,"Former conservative turned liberal activist, David Brock, suffered a heart attack Tuesday. The news is scant, but it doesn t seem to be life threatening, thank goodness. Conservatives, though, are completely giddy about the fact that a man is ill.Brock, who was instrumental in the right-wing campaign to take down Bill Clinton, and of the smear campaign against Clarence Thomas accuser Anita Hill, had a change of heart in the late 90s.Since his wakeup, Brock founded MediaMatters, the left-wing media watchdog organization and an anti-Republican PAC called American Bridge. He was (and is) also a strong advocate for Hillary Clinton.It s understandable why conservatives would dislike Brock. MediaMatters made its claim to fame by using Republicans  own words against them. Literally. Most of what they post is video and transcript of Republicans putting their own feet in their mouths. Naturally, they call that  fake news  and worse. The right tends to look at Brock as some sort of bogeyman, much like they look at George Soros. So, imagine the glee from the  pro-life  party over the fact that Brock suffered a heart attack.David Brock had a heart attack. Maybe Satan is calling one of his children home.  Cailin4Trump?

" BREAKING: Lead Republican Investigating Russia Just PROVED He’s In It For Trump, Not The Truth","Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and in charge of the investigation into whether Russia influenced our election, says he has information that members of Trump s transition team were, in fact, sort of but not really under surveillance after the election. He also reiterated that he doesn t believe Trump Tower was actually tapped, making his statements to the press confusing and conflicting.But the kicker here isn t the conflicting statements. It s that Nunes shared this information with the White House before he shared it with the rest of the intelligence committee   specifically, the Democrats, thus proving that he s way too biased and partisan to conduct a truly credible investigation.It seems that the Democratic members of the committee actually learned of all of this via the media this afternoon. In fact, Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the following about it:Today, Chairman Nunes shared information with WH still withheld from our committee. He cannot conduct a credible investigation this way. pic.twitter.com/wwrp7H7JWC  Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) March 22, 2017The information that Nunes gave to reporters earlier today is extremely important  way too important to withhold from the rest of the committee like this. Here s what he told White House reporters: First, I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions, the intelligence community collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition. Details about U.S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated intelligence community reporting.I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked.Fourth and finally, I want to be clear: None of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or of the Trump team.What I ve read bothers me and I think it should bother the president himself and his team because I think some of it seems to be inappropriate. Oddly enough, Nunes also said that he believes that this information was incidentally collected, and that members of the transition team were not specific targets of surveillance. He also believes that the information was collected legally, and disputed again Trump s claim that Obama tapped his phones at Trump Tower: No, no, no. That did not happen. I have said this for many, many weeks. The fact that Nunes decided to go running to Trump with this information, instead of briefing the rest of the committee as he should have done, suggests he s incredibly partial to Trump. He s still working on the assumption that who leaked info is more important than whether a foreign power just installed a puppet government here, undermining our democracy in one of the worst ways. This is just ridiculous   we need this turned over to an independent panel. We can t trust Nunes to either get his info straight or to behave in as impartial a manner as possible.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,22-Mar-17
 Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Trips Force Secret Service To Divert Crime-Fighting Funds To Pay For More Security,"Despite repeatedly claiming that he will be tough on crime, Donald Trump s weekend escapades to Mar-a-Lago are literally forcing the Secret Service to do less crime-fighting.The Secret Service does not merely exist to protect presidents and their families. They perform other duties as well that keep America safe such as busting currency counterfeiters, searching for missing and exploited children, and cybercrimes.But instead of doing that part of the job, the Secret Service is being forced to abandon those responsibilities in order to spend more time and money on presidential security. And it s all because Trump refuses to stop going to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach every single freaking weekend.According to the Washington Post, the Secret Service asked for an additional $60 million for their budget to fund security for Trump Tower in New York City because Melania Trump refuses to move into the White House. The extra funding would also go towards the security requirements necessary for when Trump goes to Florida to play golf.But the White House budget office denied the request. You know, because Trump actually doesn t give a shit about fighting crime.So the Secret Service is being forced to cut funding from their criminal investigation wing, which will likely lead to a rise in those criminal activities because the Secret Service won t be able to do their job effectively.Trump s vacations to Mar-a-Lago costs taxpayers $3 million every weekend and so far, Trump has only stayed in Washington one weekend since taking the oath of office. In fact, it was the weekend after taking the oath that Trump chose not to go to Palm Beach.Speaking of Palm Beach, despite promising to create jobs, Trump s frequent visits to Mar-a-Lago on the taxpayer s dime is taking a toll on local businesses there because all the extra security measures are causing businesses to lose money. Local taxpayers have also had to spend money on extra security for Trump, which has forced the Palm Beach city council to consider a measure that would slap a tax on Trump to help reimburse the city.And at the rate Trump is going back and forth between Washington and Palm Beach, he will likely force the Secret Service to blow their entire budget well before the next fiscal year commences. Trump is on pace to take more vacation days in one year than President Obama did in eight, and Trump s vacation time will cost taxpayers even more.So not only are taxpayers losing money, the American people are losing a crucial element of our ability to fight crime in this country. Not only can counterfeit money flow to fund multiple criminal endeavors, it can hurt the economy by flooding it with too much currency and would hurt the reputation of the dollar. If other nations and businesses can t trust the authenticity of our money, the whole system could suffer greatly.Perhaps the Secret Service would be better off choosing to not protect Trump so much. After all, he s the one making their job more difficult than it should be.

Comey also confirmed that Trump s wiretapping accusation against President Obama is bullshit.These revelations have given the White House Press Corps a lot of questions to ask, and Sean Spicer is not happy about it.In particular, Spicer has had to deal with questions surrounding former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who has been attempting to spread pro-Putin propaganda on behalf of Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska for over a decade.Again, Spicer does not like having to answer questions about Trump s ties to Russia. He would like the media to ignore them and become propaganda outlets for Trump instead. But Spicer is not getting his way.During Wednesday s press briefing, Axios reporter Jonathan Swan asked Spicer about Manafort s connection to Russia and wanted to know if Trump knew about it. H was not aware of Paul s client in the last decade,  Spicer claimed before getting snippy.  What else is coming out? What else don t we know? Where he went to school, who he went to grade school with, who he played with in the sandbox? Of course, Spicer s credibility imploded on his first day on the job so reporters have no reason to believe him when he claims Trump doesn t know something.Anyway, another reporter attempted to ask a follow-up question and that led to yet another testy exchange, which morphed into yet another Spicer temper tantrum.SPICER:  I m answering a question, here. REPORTER:  I m asking a question. SPICER:  No, you re not. The answer to your question is to talk about someone having a client ten years ago that had a consulting company with clients around the world. I don t know what he got paid to do. He was a consultant, he had clients around the world. There was no suggestion he did anything improper but to suggest that the president knew who his clients were from a decade ago is a bit insane. He wasn t a government employee, he did not fill out any paperwork attesting to something. There was nothing he did to suggest at this point that anything was nefarious, he was hired to do a job, he did it plain and simple. Here s the video via YouTube: Sean Spicer is seriously terrible at his job. His credibility is shot all to hell and he constantly shoots himself in the foot by getting into confrontations with reporters because they ask certain questions that Spicer and Trump would rather not have to answer.INstead of attacking the media, Spicer would be better off just answering the questions, because the more defensive he gets, the more it looks like Trump has something to hide. And that means Spicer will have to answer even more questions.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,22-Mar-17
 Donald Trump Jr Posts Disgusting Lie About London’s Muslim Mayor Minutes After London Terror Attack,"This morning, a man drove his car into a crowd near the UK s parliament building and began attacking bystanders with a knife. Across the ocean, America s conservative handled the scary situation with characteristic boorishness. At the forefront of this despicable behavior was President Trump s own son. British police hadn t even confirmed the number of dead before Donald Trump Jr used the attack as a pretext to promote Islamophobia on Twitter.While emergencies workers worked on the injured and police began piecing together what happened, Don Jr. decided his contribution would be to spread a vicious and pathetic lie about London s mayor. Why would he focus on this man while the city was still in shock? Because Mayor Sadiq Khan is Muslim.In a tweet, Don Jr. implied Khan was somehow sympathetic to terrorists, inaccurately quoting him as having said  Terror attacks are part of living in big city [sic].  Don commented: You have got to be kidding me?! You have to be kidding me?!: Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan https://t.co/uSm2pwRTjO  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 22, 2017Like clockwork, other conservative Trump-clingers began running with the quote as well.Will London's Muslim mayor, @SadiqKhan, once again say that Muslim terror attacks are just ""part and parcel"" of living in a major city?  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) March 22, 2017Can't wait for London s Muslim Mayor to lecture us about how terror attacks are  part and parcel  of urban life  again.  Faith J. Goldy  ?? (@FaithGoldy) March 22, 2017The problem: The quote and the link used in Don Jr. s tweet are ludicrously wrong. The real quote paints Khan as a man not sympathetic to terrorism but vigilant about stopping terrorism. Here s the full quote given in 2016 to the Evening Standard: What I do know is that part and parcel of living in a great, global city is that you ve got to be prepared for these sort of things. You ve got to be vigilant. You ve got to support the police who do an incredibly hard job. You ve got to support the security services and I think speculating when you don t know the facts is unwise. In other words, Khan is doing all the things every mayor in every major city in the world is doing: Working to stop terrorism while knowing that a big city s size and landmarks make tempting targets. Nowhere does he accept that terrorism is  part and parcel  of urban life. Fighting it is.Don Jr has yet to express any condolences to the families of the victims. He s so far tweeted exclusively about Muslims (including this lie about London s mayor). The lack of basic decency seems to run in the family. Don Jr. s dad once commented on the mass shooting in Orlando by infamously saying  appreciate the congrats. It s like every tragedy is seen not as a horrifying moment of pain and suffering for the victims but something to be exploited to further an agenda. Don Jr desperately wants to smear Muslims and if it means lying about the mayor of the city that was just attacked, then that s what he ll do.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images",News,22-Mar-17
 ‘Dealmaker’ Trump LOST Votes When He Visited Congress To Beg Them To Pass His Healthcare Bill,"Donald Trump is another step closer to suffering a major policy defeat, and that s good news for the Affordable Care Act.Trump and House Republicans have been pushing for passage of a bill they dubiously refer to as the  American Healthcare Act,  depsite the fact that s it not American nor is it healthcare.Indeed, the legislation is designed to kill the Affordable Care Act, which slowed the rising costs of health insurance premiums and extended healthcare coverage to tens of millions of Americans.If Republicans pass Trumpcare, millions of Americans will lose their coverage and the price of healthcare will skyrocket, especially among senior citizens.The Republican bill is a bad one, but Trump, who thinks it s  wonderful,  went to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to beg Republicans to pass it and threatened to punish any Republicans who vote against it.Several Republicans who attended the meeting told the Washington Post that Trump literally promised to  come after  them. I m gonna come after you, but I know I won t have to, because I know you ll vote  yes,  Trump said.  Honestly, a loss is not acceptable, folks. But apparently, Trump s threats spectacularly backfired and his self-manufactured reputation as a  dealmaker  took a humiliating hit.Prior to the meeting, NBC had counted 17 Republicans who were leaning against the bill. After the meeting NBC counted 27, which means ten Republicans turned against Trump and his pathetic health care bill in a matter of hours.Republicans are hoping to bring the bill up for a vote on the House floor on Thursday, but it won t pass if GOP leadership can t keep the number of Republicans leaning against it under 22.This would be a humiliating defeat for Trump, especially after he has repeatedly hyped the bill on social media.On Wednesday morning, Trump bragged about the bill on Twitter again.Big day for healthcare. Working hard!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2017It s a big day alright. Will these 27 Republicans refuse to let Trump bully them into voting for a bad bill or will they stand their ground and kill it on behalf of the tens of millions of Americans who desperately need their healthcare coverage?If they stand their ground, Trump will be a loser, but the American people will win. And last time I checked, congressmen work for the people, not Trump.Featured image via Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty Images",News,22-Mar-17
 Sarah Palin Removes Offensive Tweet After Being Humiliated For Whining About A Black Man Donating To Charity,"The overwhelming response to her temper tantrum was so humiliating that Sarah Palin removed the outrageous tweet.Just after midnight on Wednesday morning, Palin apparently learned that former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick donated money to Meals on Wheels.Palin has relentlessly targeted Kaepernick because he exercised his freedom to kneel during the national anthem in protest of police brutality against people of color.Kaepernick is currently a free agent and will likely find a new team before the next NFL season begins, but that didn t stop Palin from gloating about his current status.In response to Donald Trump s draconian budget that slashes funding for Meals on Wheels, a program that helps millions of senior citizens get a meal and a well-being check every day from a volunteer, Kaepernick donated $50,000 to the organization.For some reason, Palin has a problem with this and she threw a mini hissy fit on Twitter complete with a link to a story on her own website.Palin soon deleted the offensive tweet and we ll get to the reason why shortly, however, a screenshot was obtained by a Twitter user.Since she deleted her tweet, here s the screengrab where she mocks Kaepernick for donating to Meals on Wheels. pic.twitter.com/yPFYgR23zu  Rey  Azure  McSriff (@aguyuno) March 22, 2017As you can see, Palin mocked Kaepernick for currently not having a job, even though there are still quite a few months before the next NFL season begins and free agency is part of the game.Palin linked to story on her website that called Kaepernick s donation a purely  political stunt. You know, because Palin doesn t believe Kaepernick is capable of such a generous gesture out of the kindness of his heart.The article has also been removed.And that s because Palin was buried under such an avalanche of humiliation that she was forced to do so.In particular, Twitter users pointed out that Palin herself does not have a job. She s a mere grifter who quit her previous job as Governor of Alaska because it was easier to swindle money out of her gullible fans.imagine being so racist you get mad a black athlete for donating to meals on wheels https://t.co/wIEa4RBK3s  Adam H. Johnson (@adamjohnsonNYC) March 22, 2017@SarahPalinUSA Has your lazy ass ever finished a job?  Drew MacDonald (@DrewYouRiot) March 22, 2017@ItsTonyNow What is Sarah Palin s job exactly  Harvey K. ? (@krallenbauche) March 22, 2017@SarahPalinUSA you dismiss donating to the needy as a political stunt?  Wilson (@mikebabaganoosh) March 22, 2017And that s pretty much how it went until Palin was so shamed that she took down her tweet and the article.Perhaps, next time, Palin will criticize Donald Trump for cutting Meals on Wheels instead of attacking someone for helping them. Of course, that would be something only a human being with a soul would do.",News,22-Mar-17
 The Supreme Court Delivered A MAJOR Blow To Neil Gorsuch As He Was Testifying,"One of the selling points of Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch is that his decisions are actually so mainstream and widely respected that he s never been overturned. Well, that argument wasn t true before he testified, but today it s even less true. One of decisions was unanimously overturned by the very court he s applying for, while he was testifying on his own behalf in front of Congress. To my recollection, no opinion I have authored has been reversed by a reviewing court or affirmed with significant criticism,  he wrote in a questionnaire submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee this weekend.Source: Daily CallerBefore this week, Gorsuch had had at least eight cases reviewed by the higher court. Seven were upheld by the court.Two opinions he joined were overturned by the high court. One was Direct Marketing Association v. Brohl, a case concerning whether federal courts had jurisdiction to hear a challenge to a state tax law. The second case concerned a sentencing issue. Gorsuch did not write the opinion in either case.His streak was broken on Tuesday. The case was about the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which ensures that students with disabilities are provided with a  free appropriate public education  from the federal government.Under Gorsuch s opinion in Luke P., a school district complies with the law so long as they provide educational benefits that  must merely be  more than de minimis. De minimis  is a Latin phrase meaning  so minor as to merit disregard.  So Gorsuch essentially concluded that school districts comply with their obligation to disabled students so long as they provide those students with a little more than nothing.Gorsuch s decision was even too much for the hardline conservatives on the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the unanimous opinion, saying that the  de minimis  criteria is far too low.When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing  merely more than de minimis  progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all. For children with disabilities, receiving instruction that aims so low would be tantamount to  sitting idly . . . awaiting the time when they were old enough to  drop out. Source: Think ProgressWhile this certainly doesn t disqualify Gorsuch from the office (the fact that he s only under consideration because Republicans stole the seat is what disqualifies him), it is a problem for the Trump administration. Trump rightfully took a lot of heat for mocking a reporter with a disability while on the campaign trail. With the latest Supreme Court decision, that can of worms opened right back up in an already contentious nomination hearing.Featured image via Wikimedia.",News,22-Mar-17
" Trump Campaign Manager Busted In Another HUGE Lie, Worked For A Decade To ‘Benefit Putin Government’ (DETAILS)","More information about Donald Trump s Russian ties keeps coming out and now another shoe has dropped. According to the Associated Press, Paul Manafort, who served as Trump s campaign manager in 2016, spent about ten years working to  benefit  Vladimir Putin. His job? To make Putin not look like a murderous dictator.The AP reports:Manafort proposed in a confidential strategy plan as early as June 2005 that he would influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and the former Soviet republics to benefit the Putin government, even as U.S.-Russia relations under Republican President George W. Bush grew worse. Manafort pitched the plans to Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006, according to interviews with several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. Manafort and Deripaska maintained a business relationship until at least 2009, according to one person familiar with the work.Trump, his administration, and Manafort himself have spent months downplaying his involvement with Russia, even after he left the campaign because of his Russian ties. But it turns out that Manafort was apparently far closer to Putin than he ever let on.In a memo to Deripaska in 2005, Manafort wrote that we are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success.  The effort, he explained, will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government. Manafort responded with a statement that said his dealings with Deripaska are being unfairly painted as  inappropriate or nefarious  and insists this is all just part of a massive  smear campaign. I worked with Oleg Deripaska almost a decade ago representing him on business and personal matters in countries where he had investments,  Manafort said.  My work for Mr. Deripaska did not involve representing Russian political interests. This latest disclosure comes after FBI Director James Comey confirmed on Monday that the bureau is investigating not just Russia s interference in the U.S. election, but also the possibility that Trump colluded with them to sway the election.You can watch more on this story here, via MSNBC:Featured image via video screen capture",News,22-Mar-17
 Trump’s Rambling Speech About Abe Lincoln Is Like Watching A Car Crash In Slow Motion (VIDEO)," I m convinced that whenever Trump says  most people don t know,  it really means  I just learned.'  That was Chris Hayes s takeaway from watching Trump s flailing attempt to talk about Abraham Lincoln   a man he clearly knew nothing about. The fact that he was ignorant of one of America s most famous presidents was painfully obvious.An infamous bullshitter, Trump is either getting worse at it or we re getting better at spotting it.Trump was at a fundraiser for Republicans when he decided to share a little hidden gem about Abraham Lincoln that he assumed nobody knew: Lincoln was a Republican.For most people who graduated elementary school that is common knowledge. For Trump, it was a revelation. He was so impressed by it that he ordered Republicans to start paying to promote the fact. Great president. Most people don t even know he was a Republican. Right? Does anyone know? A lot of people don t know that. We have to build that up a little more. Naturally, even that statement was a lie. A recent Pew study found that over half of respondents knew that Lincoln was a Republican.Nevertheless, he instructed right-wing Political Action Committees to start buying television ads to inform the public that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. The crowd politely laughed, unsure if it was a joke or not:The remainder of Trump s speech was equally insane. At one point, he noted a few rival real estate developers in the crowd and had an on-stage meltdown. He s President of the United States and still engaged in petty feuds with business tycoons that he views as his competitors. His unfiltered rant is like watching his brain go to war with itself. He knows he should be more dignified, less petty, but he just can t help it.This is, by far, my favorite bit from the president s speech tonight. pic.twitter.com/xDTMZy9zeI  Hunter Walker (@hunterw) March 22, 2017Truly unhinged behavior.Featured image via Twitter",News,22-Mar-17
 The Wall Street Journal Just Slammed Trump As A ‘Fake President’ For Lying So Much,"This is especially monumental since the Wall Street Journal is a conservative newspaper.Donald Trump is running out of supporters, and that includes his supporters within the media.The straw that appears to have broken the camel s back is Trump s accusation that President Obama wiretapped him during the 2016 Election. Of course, Trump offered zero evidence to back up his claim then and he still hasn t provided any now.But when FBI Director James Comey testified to Congress under oath that Trump s wiretapping accusation is complete bullshit, whatever shred of credibility Trump had left imploded in an instant and now some right-wing media outlets are backing away from him.Fox News began distancing themselves from Trump after he threw them under the bus because Sean Spicer repeated a claim that President Obama enlisted British intelligence to wiretap Trump, which was basd o a conspiracy theory offered up by Fox legal analyst Andrew Napolitano, who has since been refuted by the network and removed from all programming indefinitely.And now the Wall Street Journal appears to also be coming to their senses.In a piece published on Tuesday, the Journal slammed Trump for clinging to his lies about Obama like a drunk person clinging to an empty bottle. The President clings to his assertion like a drunk to an empty gin bottle, rolling out his press spokesman to make more dubious claims,  the Journal wrote.  Sean Spicer who doesn t deserve this treatment was dispatched last week to repeat an assertion by a Fox News commentator that perhaps the Obama Administration had subcontracted the wiretap to British intelligence. The Journal then pointed out that Trump did this all the time during the election and that he was able to get away with it at the time because his supporters did not care about the truth. As Trump said during the campaign, he could have murdered someone in broad daylight on the street and his supporters would have still voted for him.But Trump is in the White House now, and that means his usual tired rhetoric and outrageous accusations horrify more people than it amuses because the American people as a whole are watching. And most of them despise Trump and are terrified of what he will do next.Trump s credibility has imploded here and abroad as he has caused international incidents between us and some of our strongest allies. For instance, he insulted Great Britain and Germany in the week alone and has also insulted Mexico, Australia, and China. How is Trump going to convince other nations to support our foreign policies if he can t even get along with the nations we get along with the most? All of this continues the pattern from the campaign that Mr. Trump is his own worst political enemy,  the Journal continues.  He survived his many false claims as a candidate because his core supporters treated it as mere hyperbole and his opponent was untrustworthy Hillary Clinton. But now he s President, and he needs support beyond the Breitbart cheering section that will excuse anything. As he is learning with the health-care bill, Mr. Trump needs partners in his own party to pass his agenda. He also needs friends abroad who are willing to trust him when he asks for support, not least in a crisis. The Journal then concluded by calling attention to the fact that Trump s poll numbers are in the toilet and that Americans think he s a fraud. Two months into his Presidency, Gallup has Mr. Trump s approval rating at 39%. No doubt Mr. Trump considers that fake news, but if he doesn t show more respect for the truth most Americans may conclude he s a fake President. Frankly, it s too late for Trump to rebuild his credibility, assuming he had any to begin with. He refuses to admit he was wrong and refuses to apologize even when he is proven wrong beyond a shadow of a doubt. He has lied so much in just the first 60 days of his presidency that even Richard Nixon would be embarrassed.At this point, Trump needs to resign or he should be impeached. America cannot afford to put up with his lies any longer. He is going to cause an international incident someday that could get us all killed because he couldn t keep his big mouth shut. He s a disgrace to the nation and out Constitution and he must be stopped before he humiliates America worse than he has already.Featured image via Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images",News,22-Mar-17
 Former Colorado GOP Leader Who Said Only Dems Commit Voter Fraud Charged With Voter Fraud,"Just last year before the 2016 presidential election, conservative radio host and former Colorado Republican chairman Steve Curtis said, It seems to me that virtually every case of voter fraud I can remember in my lifetime was committed by Democrats. The state s prosecutors on Tuesday accused Curtis, 57, of voter fraud for allegedly filling out and mailing in his ex-wife s 2016 ballot for president, KDVR reports.Curtis has been charged with one count of misdemeanor voter fraud and one count of forgery.The Washington Post reports:The case is the only voter fraud investigation related to the 2016 election that has resulted in criminal charges in the state, the Colorado secretary of state s office told Denver s ABC affiliate.Curtis has not entered a plea. If convicted, he could face more than a year of prison time and a $5,000 fine.Watch: His ex-wife, Kelly Curtis, said, I was livid over the whole situation, definitely. Curtis said that she left her husband after being married for just nine months. I didn t feel it was an equal partnership, I ll just leave it at that,  she said. It was demeaning and presumptuous, and I had no idea what would go on in someone s mind to cast my ballot for me illegally, actually to go to all the trouble to forge my ballot,  Ms. Curtis said.The forgery was discovered by Weld County prosecutors when Kelly Curtis called the county s Elections Office in October to ask how she could vote because she had just moved to South Carolina and explained that she was still registered to vote in Colorado. Kelly was told by an election worker that she had already voted by mail and the elections office already had her ballot. I was just completely stunned. I thought there had to be some kind of mistake,  Kelly Curtis said.In 2011, Steve Curtis oversaw the advisory board for the Denver Tea Party Patriots.While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump alleged that the election would be  rigged  and claimed that there was widespread voter fraud. Without offering evidence   just as with his recent wiretap claims   Trump said after the election that between 3 to 5 million votes were cast illegally. Trump said that to prove that he really won the popular vote (he did not win the popular vote).Following the election, it was found that the few who were charged with voter fraud, were in fact, Republican voters.As for Steve Curtis, he certainly excels at projection.Image via screen capture.

 This Die Hard Trump Supporter Has Now Gone Full #NeverTrump (VIDEO),"Kraig Moss was a die hard Donald Trump supporter. He followed the then-GOP presidential candidate around the nation, playing his guitar and singing special songs he had written especially for Trump. He was well known in Trump supporter circles, due to his guitar decorated with Trump stickers and other campaign items. He became known as the  Trump Troubadour.  In the end, Moss had attended 45 Trump rallies. However, all of that has changed now.Moss tragically lost his son to a heroin overdose. He sincerely believes that if his family had had health insurance at the time of the overdose, his son might still be alive. That s why Moss no longer supports Trump: because of his pushing the new healthcare bill that is being trotted out by House Republicans. Moss knows how awful the bill is, and how many people it will rob of healthcare. Thanks to this fact, he no longer sings his Trump songs, and he no longer supports the president. Moss says of his turning on Trump: The bill is an absolute betrayal of what Trump represented on the campaign trail. I feel betrayed. The disastrous healthcare bill will result in terrible losses for addiction services. For Kraig Moss, this is personal. So, now, instead of promoting Trump, Moss held a fund raiser to help a drug rehabilitation facility, raising $3,000 in his son s name.Hopefully, more and more people begin to realize what a massive con Trump has managed to pull off, and he gets annihilated in four years if he isn t impeached first.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,22-Mar-17

 Cowardly GOP Rep. Files Police Complaint Against SENIORS Because He’s TERRIFIED Of Dissent,"Republican members of Congress, who love claiming that they re the only party that stands for real Americans, are now terrified of their own constituents. This is happening for one simple reason   they never expected their own constituents to be angry with what they re doing on Capitol Hill. So instead of facing the music and admitting that the entire GOP platform is something Americans don t want, they re running scared.Such is the case with Idaho representative Raul Labrador. His office had the audacity to file a complaint against a group of people made up primarily of senior citizens because they were showing up at his office in Lewiston on a weekly basis to voice their displeasure with him and the GOP. Labrador obviously considers this a threat, and perhaps, if they d threatened violence it would be.But that s not what s happening. Chris Ankeny, the chief of police in Lewiston, the Idaho town where this is taking place, says these people were protesting in front of Labrador s offices and that no crimes had been committed. Employees are uncomfortable with them because of the national attention this group had garnered, not because of credible (or even in-credible) threats.Labrador s office contacted the D.C. Capitol Police over this because that force has jurisdiction over U.S. Congresspeople s offices in addition to Capitol Hill. They did so because they felt the Lewiston department wasn t doing anything. The thing is, a good police department won t do anything when they confirm that there s no crime happening (including threats). So what this is is an office full of people who can t handle dissent.The worst part is that this group has so many seniors, and Labrador won t hear them. These are people who may be worried about cuts to programs they depend on, including Medicare and Meals on Wheels. Others living in and around Lewiston are worried about climate change and clean energy. They say Labrador s absence from his offices is a sign of cowardice, and they re not wrong. He is a coward.Many Republicans have run away and hidden from their constituents lately because they can t tolerate the fact that their constituents  concerns run counter to the GOP s platform. They re too used to putting party above country. Maybe this is uncharted territory for them, but shouldn t these guys, who work for the very people they re pissing off, actually stop to listen?Or are they not what they ve been trying to sell to us?It s really disgusting that Labrador s office feels so threatened by non-violent, non-threatening protests from senior citizens that they ve had to file a complaint.Featured image by Gage Skidmore.

 Trump Sends Lawyers After 17-Year-Old Girl Over Website Where Kittens Scratch Him,"What happens when a thin-skinned bully becomes President? Apparently, he will even threaten children who hurt his precious little fee-fees.A 17-year-old girl known only as Lucy from San Fransisco created a cute website for her resume that featured kittens punching Donald Trump. Lucy created  TrumpScratch.com  as a  fun little  project. It s pretty simple   users click on The Donald s face to punch him with tiny kitten paws.But her project, which was intended for fun, caused Lucy to fall into a legal nightmare because at his core, Donald Trump is nothing more than a schoolyard bully who can t deal with any form of criticism whatsoever.After the website was live for three weeks, Lucy received a cease and desist letter from Trump s general counsel.The letter calls Trump a  well-known businessman  and informs Lucy that As I m sure you re aware, the Trump name is internationally known and famous. And, of course, as a public figure he opens himself up to criticism   even if it is in the form of a kitten-themed website it took a high school girl three hours to code. I was going to just let this go, but I think it s, pardon my French, fucking outrageous that the president of the United States has his team scouring the internet for sites like mine to send out cease and desists and legal action claims if we don t shut down,  Lucy told the Observer.  Meanwhile, he tweets about The Apprentice ratings and sends out power-drunk tweets about phone tapping. HOW ABOUT BEING THE PRESIDENT?

It s so sad that his administration is focused more on being liked, burying real news and taking down sites like mine as they supposedly make him look bad,  she says.You can view her masterpiece here.Featured image via screengrab",News,21-Mar-17
 American Spring Breakers Chant Trump’s ‘Build That Wall!’ While IN MEXICO,"While a group of Americans were vacationing in Cancun, Mexico for Spring break, they broke out in chants of  Build that wall!  earlier this month and even though there were complaints, they refused to stop, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reports.A Mexican newspaper, The Yucatan Times, blasted the group in an editorial Friday, calling the students  behavior while on a ship  unacceptable.  The paper said this is not an isolated incident from young spring breakers and noted that there have been other  acts of xenophobia and discrimination against Mexicans within their own country. The paper wrote that  in recent days many Spring Breakers have been offensive, rude and haughty towards Mexican people. According to witnesses, the  Build that wall  chant grew increasingly louder. In the face of such stupidity, one doesn t know how to immediately react,  one woman who was on the boat with her husband and witnessed the incident wrote on Facebook.  We were stunned. The whole thing seemed implausible. I have always been tolerant of the countries of the world and I have wanted to believe that human stupidity and ignorance   is characteristic of a small group of people,  Anaximandro Amable wrote.  But there are things with which one cannot be tolerant, such as discourse that incites hatred. The paper adds that  This situation is far from being an isolated incident, and it adds to the growing number of complaints from tourism sector workers. While Trump was on the campaign trail his crowd of supporters routinely broke out in  Build the wall  chants.In 2015, Trump said, I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. And now, Mexico is not paying for the wall. We, the taxpayers, are.Hey Trump supporters, if you guys could quit embarrassing the rest of us, that d be great. Thanks.Image via screen capture. ",News,21-Mar-17
 Nixon’s Counsel During Watergate CALLS OUT Trump Administration: They’re ‘In Cover-Up Mode’,"The man who served as White House Counsel to former President Richard Nixon during Watergate (and ended up facing charges for helping to it cover up) is weighing in on Donald Trump s ongoing scandal with Russia. His opinion? Trump s administration is  in cover-up mode. John Dean sat down for an interview with MSNBC s Chris Hayes on Monday night and his summation of Trump s current situation was clear when Hayes asked about Trump s shady ties to Russia and his bogus wiretapping claims. In fact [the White House] is in cover-up mode,  Dean replied.On Monday, FBI Director James Comey testified before the House Intelligence Committee and he confirmed that the bureau is indeed investigating Russia s interference in the 2016 election. He also said that the FBI is investigating the possibility that Trump and his campaign colluded with Russia.In addition, Comey said during the hearing that the Justice Department has absolutely no evidence to support Trump s claim that former President Obama had the phones at Trump Tower tapped.According to Dean, Trump s desperate attempts to distance himself from Comey s testimony is highly suggestive of a  cover- up. There s just never been any question in my mind about that. I ve been inside a cover-up. I know how they look and feel. And every signal they re sending is:  We re covering this thing up,'  Dean said. Experienced investigators know this. They know how people react when they re being pursued, and this White House is not showing their innocence, they re showing how damn guilty they are, is what we re seeing. During the Watergate scandal, Dean ended up charged with obstruction of justice. Trump, he said, is well on his way to committing the same crime. There s also the question of whether this White House will obstruct, essentially, an investigation. You now have the head of the FBI with a target painted on its back, the front-line investigators with targets painted on their backs; you have a U.S. attorney the president said he was going to retain who has been summarily fired in Preet Bharara, and it strikes me that there is in some ways a kind of obstruction land mine   that the entirety of the White House now has to tip-toe through,  Dean said.Trump had personally promised Bharara that he would be keeping his job, then last week he changed his mind and fired him without warning. Bharara just happened to be investigating Trump s Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price (among other things), but of course, this had absolutely nothing to do with Trump suddenly deciding to give him the boot. (Insert sarcasm here.)Trump s Russia problem isn t going away anytime soon. Like with Watergate, it is just a matter of time until the truth comes out and Trump s dirty deeds blow up in his face.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,21-Mar-17
" Lindsey Graham Just Went ROGUE, Threatened To IMPEACH Trump (VIDEO)","We re only two months into Trump s failing presidency, and even the Republican Party wants nothing more than to see the end of it. What s even more surprising, is that many of the party s most prominent members are doing very little to hide their feelings and disappointment.Earlier today, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) took the opportunity to grill Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch during his confirmation hearing. Graham has been a major critic of Trump since his presidential campaign, and he made sure to insult Trump on his stance on torture practices while questioning Gorsuch. Sending a warning to Trump about his stance on waterboarding in particular, Graham said to Gorsuch: You have said several times he is not above the law. So if we have laws on the book that prevent waterboarding  do you agree with me that the Detainee Treatment Act prevents waterboarding? Under the Detainee Treatment Act, waterboarding is illegal   and yet, Trump has blatantly stated during his campaign that he doesn t believe waterboarding is a torture method. He has previously said in several different interviews that waterboarding  absolutely  works and claims it is  just short of torture. Graham then followed his question to Gorsuch up with this statement, which sounded much like a promise and a threat to Trump: In case President Trump is watching   if you start waterboarding, you may be impeached. Gorsuch s response made it perfectly clear that he was in agreement with Graham. He said: Senator, the impeachment power belongs to this body. No man is above the law. You can watch Graham send this shocking message to Trump below:There have never been more reasons to impeach a president, and now even Republicans are beginning to recognize that this man does not belong in the White House.Featured image via screenshot",News,21-Mar-17
" Trump Has A Really, REALLY Disturbing Bedtime Ritual, It Will DISGUST You (DETAILS)","Donald Trump s two month old presidency has been so disastrous, the only things we know he s doing (besides working to strip health care from millions of Americans and humiliating the country) is play golf and watch television. A LOT of television.Pretty much everything Trump has tweeted or referred to in interviews has been influenced by something he watched on TV   Fox News in particular. Trump s obsession with cable news and the way he s being portrayed is an all-consuming hobby for the narcissistic POTUS, and he s taken it to a truly disturbing level.Apparently, according go New York Magazine reporter Gabriel Sherman, Trump records news shows all throughout the day so he can watch how different networks have covered him right before he goes to bed. He does this every single night! In an appearance on Slate s Trump podcast, Sherman said: People in Trump world say basically a lot of Fox. But the other thing he does, from a source close to the White House told me that he does DVR basically all of the cable news. It s kind of remarkable when you think about it, that someone would actually want to watch cable news on recording. Donald Trump, apparently he does. And when he goes back up to the residence at the end of the day, I ve been told does spend a lot of time flipping through cable networks, including CNN, and catching up on the way that he s been covered. This is a man whose validation is cemented by how the media covers him. So he sort of obsessively monitors his media coverage. So basically, Trump s unhealthy obsession with television is just another way that he caters to his monstrous ego. This makes perfect sense, especially since Sherman stated that Trump s primary source of live information  was Fox News, one of the only networks that routinely speaks of him favorably. It would be nice if, for a change, Trump would stop watching television (especially the highly inaccurate Fox News) and actually do his job for once.Featured image is a screenshot",News,21-Mar-17
 BUSTED: Republican Conspired With Aide To Label Angry Constituents ‘Un-American’ For Booing Him,"A Michigan Republican may have literally guaranteed that he won t get another term in Congress.Republicans across the country have been cowardly avoiding holding town hall events because thousands of their angry constituents have been showing up to protest their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a move that would strip healthcare away from millions of Americans and drive up the price of healthcare beyond what many can afford.And that s exactly what happened on Saturday in Michigan when Rep. David Trott actually had the balls to show his face to his constituents in the 11th district he supposedly represents.However, things went spectacularly wrong for Trott from the beginning as the 1,000 people in attendance were not amused by his defense of the repeal effort. The crowd booed him and chanted,  Vote him out!  Things got even worse when Trott lied by claiming that the United States military is  the weakest it s ever been. In fact, our military is the most funded military on the planet. It could be cut in half and still be the most well-funded military on Earth. Claiming that our military is weak is not only a lie, it s an insult to every American who currently wears the uniform.But in response to being booed off the stage, Trott dug the hole deeper by getting caught on a hot mic conspiring with one of his aides to portray his own constituents as  un-American. We re going to take that part where they re booing funding the military and I m going to get somebody to write a story and we re going to promote the sh*t out of that,  an aide told Trott behind closed doors.  It s un-American crap. Here s the video via YouTube: That s right. A Republican congressman is literally going to get someone to write a cheap propaganda story for him so he can accuse his own constituents of hating the military and portray them as  un-American  in retaliation against them for booing him and his lies.Forget waiting until the next election, Trott should be forced to resign in disgrace right now for what his aide just said about his own constituents.Featured image via screenshot",News,21-Mar-17
" Fox & Friends Ignores FBI Director’s Trump Bombshell, And Jake Tapper CALLS THEM OUT","Fox & Friends continues to embarrass themselves in defense of Donald Trump, and CNN host Jake Tapper took them to task for it.On Monday, FBI Director James Comey testified under oath on Capitol Hill that Trump s accusation that President Obama wiretapped him is totally false and that Trump is under investigation for colluding with Russia during the 2016 Election.Trump s credibility was completely destroyed and his Russia scandal only deepened.But Fox & Friends downplayed Comey s damning testimony by claiming that Americans  didn t miss much  and posted a video on Twitter featuring 25 seconds of footage of Comey telling lawmakers that he can t answer their question.

 WATCH: Morning Joe Hosts Urge Republicans To Abandon Trump After FBI Director Comey’s Testimony,"If Republicans listen to this sage advice, Donald Trump would be a lame duck president before completing his first 100 days.In stunning testimony to Congress on Monday, FBI Director James Comey confirmed that Donald Trump lied when he accused President Obama of wiretapping him.For more than two weeks, Trump has been desperately trying to make his accusations against President Obama stick, but has repeatedly failed to provide evidence to support his claims.That culminated in Comey s testimony under oath in which it was revealed that Trump is full of shit and he is being investigated for colluding with Russia during the 2016 Election.Apparently, the investigation has been ongoing for months, which means Trump s Russia scandal just got a whole lot worse, especially for Republicans who continue to defend him.Comey s testimony was aired on national television and was seen by millions of Americans.At a time when Trump s poll numbers are in the toilet, one would think that Republicans would abandon his sinking ship before they drown with him. But so far, Republicans are stubbornly standing by him because they don t want to lose their rubber stamp in the White House.Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, however, are urging Republicans to run away from Trump or face serious consequences in 2018 when the midterm elections roll around and give Americans their first chance to tell Trump and his Republican allies to go f*ck themselves. Republicans have to understand right now, if this continues, and this is awfully early to say this, but if this continues, at least in the House, and there were a lot of Senate seats, they are going to be shocked on Election Night if they don t take care of themselves,  Scarborough predicted. If the Republican Party doesn t start taking care of itself and stop making fools of themselves for a guy who is going to keep tweeting lies and nonsense   they can t chase that around,  Scarborough continued.  They can t defend the indefensible. Here s the video via YouTube: If Republicans continue to pretend that Trump is not a threat to our nation there will be hell to pay. Millions of Trump voters are experiencing buyer s remorse right now and millions of voters who sat out in 2016 are itching to make up for that mistake in 2018 and 2020. But regardless of what Republicans in the House and Senate do, they should be ousted from office anyway. They had a chance to prevent Trump from ever becoming president and put their greed and lust for power above the security and well-being of the nation. They betrayed the United States by turning a blind eye to Trump s associations with Russia and Vladimir Putin and they continue to betray our country now. Republicans should abandon Trump to save their souls, not their jobs.Featured image screenshot",News,21-Mar-17
 Trump’s Terrible Monday Has A Major Historian Suggesting That Treason Hangs Over His Administration,"Donald Trump must be forced to resign or be impeached, because this is really bad.On Monday, Trump s delusional alternate reality was shattered into a million tiny pieces when FBI Director James Comey shot down his accusation that President Obama wiretapped him AND revealed that Trump is under investigation for possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 Election.As Comey spoke, one can only imagine that Trump was throwing a massive hissy fit as his wall of lies crumbled all around him and on live television no less.And we all know how much Trump hates being humiliated on national television. His rants about Saturday Night Live have demonstrated that perfectly.The American people had a front row seat as Trump s credibility was flushed down the toilet into the very swamp he claimed he would drain.Trump is only 60 days into his presidency and he is already an unprecedented failure.Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley s evaluation of Trump s crash and burn is damning and only makes it clear that Trump will be the biggest loser in presidential history.Usually, historians avoid using the word  treason  when they evaluate a president, but Trump s case is so far beyond the pale that Brinkley pretty much had no choice.The fact that Trump is under investigation by the FBI right now and has been for months is absolutely astounding. There s a smell of treason in the air,  Brinkley told the Washington Post.  Imagine if J. Edgar Hoover or any other FBI director would have testified against a sitting president? It would have been a mind- boggling event. Indeed, even Richard Nixon didn t suffer such an embarrassment during his presidency despite being the only president who has resigned the office in disgrace. At this rate, Trump is on pace to become the first to ever be ousted via impeachment. This is the most failed first 100 days of any president,  Brinkley continued.Again, Trump still has 40 days to go before his first 100 days are completed. Yet he is already plagued by scandals and the American people despise him. To be as low as he is in the polls, in the 30s, while the FBI director is on television saying they launched an investigation into your ties with Russia, I don t know how it can get much worse,  Brinkley concluded.But it will get worse, especially as Trump s policies begin to take their toll on our nation. The GOP healthcare bill that Trump thinks is  wonderful  is set to strip health insurance from tens of millions of Americans while causing the price of healthcare to skyrocket.Trump is gutting environmental protections, education, workplace regulations, food aid programs, the State Department, the United Nations, and just about anything else that helps or improves the lives of Americans, all while seeking huge tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy.And it s all to fund his useless border wall and an increase in spending to a military that he uses irresponsibly.Trump has also strained relations with China, Australia, Mexico, Germany, and Great Britain as international tensions rise.Clearly, it can get worse, and it likely will continue to do so until Republicans in Congress finally recognize that Trump is a threat to our republic and our survival as a nation.Featured Image: Capitol Hill Blue ",News,21-Mar-17

 Trump Has Planted Spies To Ensure His Cabinet’s Loyalty – What He’s Calling Them Is TERRIFYING,"It s hard not to wonder just how paranoid and/or dictatorial Trump really is. One would think that, since he s the one appointing his cabinet, that he d be able to trust those secretaries to do their jobs according to how he wants them done. Apparently, though, that s not the case. Trump is so ridiculous that he s appointed many White House aides whose jobs are specifically to spy on the cabinet secretaries.All of these people have the title of  senior White House adviser,  and their offices are very close to their secretaries  offices. The point literally seems to be ensuring the cabinet secretaries  loyalty to Trump, seeing as how they report to the Office of Cabinet Affairs and not to the secretaries.But that s not all. That would be bad enough, but the White House has names for some of them that aren t  senior White House adviser.  For instance, the officer who s spying on General Mattis over at the Department of Defense is literally called  the commissar.  That s a reference to Soviet-era Communist Party officials whose task was just to ensure their commanders  loyalty.These people are embedded in every agency from the Departments of Defense and Health and Human Services to the EPA, even to NASA. They are in constant contact with the White House.Obama, Bush and Clinton did not use this kind of spy method to ensure their cabinets did exactly as they were told.And that s nuts. But one former Trump adviser actually thinks this is smart, which just illustrates the level of paranoia and authoritarianism that has existed inside Trump s circles even before he was elected: Especially when you re starting a government and you have a changeover of parties when policies are going to be dramatically different, I think it s something that s smart. Somebody needs to be there as the White House s man on the scene. Because there s no senior staff yet, they re functioning as the White House s voice and ears in these departments. We guess the secretaries themselves just aren t good enough.The funny thing is that the Trump administration is all up in arms about  the deep state,  and the alleged  shadow government  that Obama s supposedly running to oppose Trump. Yet, they re creating their own shadow government with these  advisers  who are supposed to spy on leaders to make sure they remain properly loyal.If Trump can t trust even his own appointees to be loyal without spies like this, then he has no business running the U.S. government. But we already knew that, and this is just the latest thing to prove that Trump is trying to position himself as Supreme Overlord of the United States, or something.Featured image by Andrea Morales via Getty Images",News,20-Mar-17
 Fox News Finally Fired An Analyst For Going TOO FAR With Lies Defending Trump,"Donald Trump just lost another one of his propagandists thanks to Fox News.Last week, Andrew Napolitano opened his big mouth and threw gasoline on a raging fire by claiming that President Obama enlisted British Intelligence agency GCHQ to wiretap Trump.Napolitano s desperate claim came after Trump and his team repeatedly were unable to produce any evidence that President Obama ordered such a wiretap.Rather than vet the claim, White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer repeated it to the press and a firestorm ensued as GCHQ issued a rare statement refuting the accusation. Thus, Napolitano helped create an international incident between the United States and one of our oldest allies.But when asked about the accusation during a press conference, Trump threw Fox News under the bus by blaming them directly instead of taking personal responsibility for repeating an accusation made by a pundit. We said nothing,  Trump said.  All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox. So you shouldn t be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox. Fox News immediately scrambled to refute Napolitano. Fox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano s commentary,  Fox anchor Shep Smith said.  Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now-President of the United States was surveilled at any time in any way. Full stop. Fox anchor Bret Baier soon followed. We love the judge, we love him here at Fox, but the Fox News division was never able to back up those claims and was never reported on this show,  Baier said.And now that FBI Director James Comey has put the nail in the coffin of Trump s wiretapping accusation, Fox News has moved to punish Napolitano.According to the Los Angeles Times, Fox News has removed Napolitano from their programming indefinitely. People familiar with the situation who could speak only on the condition of anonymity said Napolitano is not expected to be on Fox News Channel any time in the near future,  the Times reported.Indeed, it appears that Napolitano really has been yanked off the air. After all, Monday has been a heavy legal news day considering Trump is being investigated by the FBI and Neil Gorsuch is being grilled on Capitol Hill. It s heaven for legal analysts but Napolitano didn t provide any analysis for Fox News. That s because instead of being an objective analyst, Napolitano chose to support Trump by tossing out unverified claims even though he damn well knew that Trump s accusation was a lie in the first place.Napolitano s credibility is now in shambles just like Trump s. The only difference is that while Napolitano has been removed from his job, Trump continues to remain in the White House.Featured image via screenshot",News,20-Mar-17
" FBI Investigating Russian Connections To Far-Right Websites Including Breitbart, Infowars, Etc. (DETAILS)","With the 2016 election over, many questions still remain as to its outcome and if it is to be considered legitimate. As of now, the FBI and other intelligence agencies are still looking into Russian involvement in our democratic process and how the foreign power may have played a role in influencing the election results.One of the ways Russia may have influenced the election may have been through bots that spread far right-wing media stories throughout social media.According to McClatchy: Federal investigators are examining whether far-right news sites played any role last year in a Russian cyber operation that dramatically widened the reach of news stories   some fictional   that favored Donald Trump s presidential bid, two people familiar with the inquiry say.Operatives for Russia appear to have strategically timed the computer commands, known as  bots,  to blitz social media with links to the pro-Trump stories at times when the billionaire businessman was on the defensive in his race against Democrat Hillary Clinton, these sources said. Further: The bots  end products were largely millions of Twitter and Facebook posts carrying links to stories on conservative internet sites such as Breitbart News and InfoWars, as well as on the Kremlin-backed RT News and Sputnik News, the sources said. Some of the stories were false or mixed fact and fiction, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the bot attacks are part of an FBI-led investigation into a multifaceted Russian operation to influence last year s elections.Investigators examining the bot attacks are exploring whether the far-right news operations took any actions to assist Russia s operatives. Their participation, however, wasn t necessary for the bots to amplify their news through Twitter and Facebook. This past election cycle, the far-right in particular waged a war of disinformation like one that really hasn t been seen before. It didn t matter if a story wasn t real, if it was anti-Hillary or pro-Trump it went out fast and spread like wildfire. Not only were the stories mass created, but they were also seemingly consumed by readers at an alarming rate.McClatchy reports: As for the bots, they carried links not only to news stories but also to Democratic emails posted on WikiLeaks, especially those hacked from Podesta and made public in October, said Philip Howard, a professor at the Oxford University Internet Institute who has researched the bot attacks. Study of bot-generated Twitter traffic during last fall s Trump-Clinton campaign debates showed that bot messages favorable to Trump significantly outnumbered those sympathetic to Clinton. Hopefully federal investigators get to the bottom of what is happening on the far-right internet to affect the outcome of elections. If there is a connection to Russia, not only would that be huge news, but it would confirm long-held suspicions by many on the left in regards to the disinformation campaign that s been going on for years by the right.Russia is clearly trying to insert itself for its own benefit into elections and policy around the globe. It needs to be stopped, and it needs to be stopped now.Featured Photo by Marianna Massey/Getty Images",News,20-Mar-17
 Spicer Says Trump Can Golf But Obama Shouldn’t Have For This Ridiculously BS Reason (VIDEO),"Trump spent the weekend golfing in Florida. By low estimates, this is Trump s 6th golf vacation of his presidency. By higher estimates, this is his eleventh. He s been in office for just two months. Why is there discrepancies? Because Trump and his staff have repeatedly lied about his golfing outings. In one egregious example, staffers said he dropped by the golf course to merely chat with friends   then a pro golfer tweeted that he had just finished up a game with Trump. Oops. The White House simply will not be straight about Trump s obsession with golf.And they have every reason to be worried. Trump s vacations are costing American taxpayers millions of dollars per weekend. And while he hits the links, his administration tries to cut spending on things like after school food programs for hungry kids and Meals on Wheels for struggling seniors.It s also a reminder that Trump is a massive hypocrite. During Obama s tenure, Trump repeatedly attacked the president for using his scant vacation days to golf. Trump s Twitter history is an endless parade of hostile tweets directed at Obama:Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2014President Obama played golf yesterday???  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2013During his campaign, Trump vowed to never take a vacation and to never leave the White House. Instead, he s taken six weekend vacations and spends nearly all of his time at his Mar-a-Lago resort   a business still owned by himself and which recently jacked up its membership fees to reflect the fact that joining now means getting the chance to rub elbows with the president.All of this to say it was more than a little ridiculous for Sean Spicer to even attempt to defend his boss s hypocrisy on this front. Trump is so clearly breaking his promises that even a shameless flack like Spicer had to feel a twinge of embarrassment for these whoppers. Nevertheless, here we are:REPORTER: In his first eight weeks in office, President Trump has made at least 10 trips to the golf course. He regularly used to criticize President Obama for spending time on the golf course, how is his golf game any different? SPICER: Well, I think two things. One is you saw him utilize this as an opportunity with [Japanese] Prime Minister Abe to, um, help foster deeper relationships in Asia and have a growing relationship that s going to help U.S. interests. How you use the game of golf is something that he s talked about. Secondly, he had a mini-Cabinet meeting the other day down in his club in Virginia and I remember so many people jumping to the conclusion that he s going down and playing golf. Just because you go somewhere doesn t necessarily mean you did it.All of what Spicer just said is unfettered garbage. For starters, President Obama frequently used his time playing golf to conduct official business, including one time inviting the Malaysian Prime Minister to a round to   you guessed it  help foster deeper relationships in Asia. Obama was able to accomplish that without spending every single weekend of his presidency playing golf.As to Spicer s second point: His example of Trump s  mini-cabinet meeting  in Virginia is an awkward one. If Trump wasn t golfing there, why was he there at all? Why move all of his staff down to a Virginia golf course that he owns just to hold a meeting he could have had at the White House? Perhaps because, as with Mar-a-Lago, Trump still owns that business and forcing the entire White House to attend a meeting there is a financial boon to Trump s own bank account. Spicer s hamfisted attempt to defend Trump s golfing actually makes him look more corrupt.Featured image via YouTube",News,20-Mar-17
 Ivanka Trump Just ACTUALLY Became Our New First Lady,"If you ve been joking that Ivanka Trump would make a perfect First Lady (given Trump s numerous remarks through the years about how he wants to yeah), prepare to have your goddamn mind blown.Ivanka Trump won t be receiving a salary, but she will be getting her own West Wing office, government-issued communications devices, and security clearance (yes, the jokes kinda write themselves).In the past, The Donald has described Ivanka as  voluptuous  and a  piece of ass  who has  the best body.  He has also, as we re sure you aware, said that perhaps [he d] be dating her  if she wasn t his daughter. He also famously talked about how he kisses her as often as possible in comments so creepy the Dr. Oz show was forced to edit them out.

" Conservatives Blast Tomi Lahren For Being A Hypocritical Shill, Suspend Her Show","Tomi Lahren, the overly-emotional, angry and vitriolic face of new-age conservatism has been suspended at The Blaze after admitting she is indeed pro-choice. The revelation, which has spurned outcry from both the left and the right, has reportedly left her suspended from her popular show.During a Friday appearance on The View Lahren admitted she is pro-choice, and accused small government Republicans who are pro-life of being hypocrites. Lahren s exact comments were:I am a constitutional, y know, someone that loves the Constitution. I m someone that s for limited government. So I can t sit here and be a hypocrite and say I m for limited government but I think the government should decide what women do with their bodies. I can sit here and say that, as a Republican and I can say, you know what, I m for limited government, so stay out of my guns, and you can stay out of my body as well.The revelation angered many on the right, naturally. So much so that conservatives have turned against herThe Outset s Danielle Butcher, an anti-feminist conservative, lambasted Lahren as a  shill  in her latest article, writing:The Republican Party is a big-tent party, and an individual needn t adhere to each plank in the party platform to have a space to stand. If you believe in limited government, free market capitalism, and fiscal responsibility by all means consider yourself a conservative.There is not, however, room in the Republican Party for shills.Lahren s acceptance of abortion would not be so outrageous were it not for her implied rejection of it. As OUTSET Contributor Kareim Oliphant tweeted,  Tomi Lahren lambasts abortion with righteous indignation only to reveal she s pro-choice. This is your  principled conservative leader? This is a keen observation, as Lahren has previously tweeted,  Illegals have rights in the USA but not the unborn?  and included segments in her show ranting and raving against Hillary Clinton s support for gun control, comparing gun deaths to the life that is ended during abortion procedures.So the racism was OK. The conspiracy theories were OK. The vitriol and rank anger were A-OK. But her veiled support for abortion rights? Too far.But it wasn t just Butcher who blasted Lahren. Glenn Beck, owner of The Blaze and thus her boss, called her out publicly on Twitter:Wait, libertarian views? Help me out on Trumpcare, stimulus, and executive orders. Trump is anything but libertarian. #intellectualhonesty https://t.co/jlt5sFvQMP  Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) March 20, 2017Lahren likes to describe herself as a libertarian, yet sucks up to Trump and his unconstitutional, overreaching immigration orders. Leave it to Glenn Beck to eat his own (yet again).Apparently Tomi Lahren s stupidity has reached a boiling point as Beck seeks to terminate her contract in September (and possibly before that) and has even suspended her from appearing on her prime-time slot  Final Thoughts.  According to the Daily Beast:Right-wing firebrand and rising media star Tomi Lahren has reportedly been suspended by TheBlaze, where she hosts a primetime commentary show. Lahren, 24, came into controversy over the weekend after a Friday appearance on The View, in which she claimed to be  pro-choice  and essentially argued that anti-abortion conservatives are hypocrites. Her comments led to a public scolding from her boss, Glenn Beck, who then used his radio show on Monday morning to subtly jab at her as intellectually dishonest. According to The Daily Caller, another conservative outlet, Lahren s  suspension is in effect for at least one week,  and that even though  Lahren s contract with the company goes until September  she may leave the company before then.  The reasons for her alleged suspension were not revealed in the report.Republicans are turning on their own, and that s quite alright with me. If it means we don t have to listen to the whiny snowflake that is Tomi Lahren give her uninformed and grossly emotional opinion, we should all celebrate.Featured image via Flickr",News,20-Mar-17
 Trump Stands By Wiretapping Lie Despite EVERY Investigation Confirming It’s Bullsh*t,"According to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Donald Trump is standing by his claim that former President Obama tapped the phones at Trump Tower   even though everyone has confirmed it s bullsh*t.During Monday s press briefing, which took place while FBI Director James Comey s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee was on a break, Spicer was asked about the fact that Trump s wiretapping claims had been shot down by the FBI, the Justice Department, and everybody else except for a few random conspiracy theorists. He said that there is no information to support the allegations that the President made against President Obama,  ABC s Jonathan Karl said, referring to Comey, before Spicer abruptly cut him off mid question. At this time,  Spicer said. So is the President prepared to withdraw that accusation and apologize to the President?  Karl asked. No,  Spicer replied.  We started a hearing. It s still ongoing. And then, as Chairman Nunes mentioned, this is one of a series of hearings that will be happening. While testifying on Monday, Comey said that the Department of Justice has no information  whatsoever to support Trump s ridiculous assertion that Obama, or anybody else for that matter,  wiretapped  Trump Tower. Comey said he would not  characterize  Trump s tweets about the alleged wiretapping, and said only that he has  no information  to support the accusation.On Friday, the Justice Department sent documents related to Trump  wiretapping claims to the committee. Reps. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and Adam Schiff (R-Calif.) have both said publicly that there was nothing in those documents to back of Trump s accusation. We know there was not a wiretap on Trump Tower,  Nunes said.But none of this is enough to get our narcissistic tweeter-in-chief to admit that he is full of sh*t. Oh no, not Trump. He ll never back down. He lives in his own reality and is totally incapable of admitting that he is wrong. Ever. This is a terrifying trait to have in the leader of the free world, that s for sure.Watch Spicer say Trump still believes Obama tapped his phones, here:Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,20-Mar-17
 WATCH: Rep. Adam Schiff Draws A BRILLIANT And DAMNING Map Of Events Connecting Trump To Russia,"The investigations into the Trump-Russia scandal are an increasing problem for Trump as he desperately tries to steer any and all spotlights away from him and onto, well, pretty much everything else. Unfortunately for him, Rep. Adam Schiff drew an absolutely brilliant map between Trump and Russia during his statement this morning.Schiff left absolutely nothing out of his statement. His map is as follows:Schiff does acknowledge that all of this could just be a bunch of wild coincidences, but with a caveat: Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated, and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence? Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated, and that the Russians used the same techniques to corrupt U.S. persons that they have employed in Europe and elsewhere. We simply don t know, not yet, and we owe it to the country to find out. He s right. When mapped out, this string of  coincidences  is pretty damning indeed. We need an investigation, and if Trump really were innocent, he and his minions would likely not be trying to deflect. They d be saying,  Go ahead, investigate us! Investigate to your heart s content! You won t find anything. But they aren t. This scandal is about to blow up again.

 Comey Sends DAMNING Warning About Future Elections After Trump (DETAILS),"Donald Trump was nervous as hell over the hearing with FBI Director James Comey earlier today, and he had every reason to be. It s now been confirmed that Trump is in fact being investigated by the FBI, however Americans shouldn t rejoice yet. There are still more dangers facing America.Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, kicked the hearing off by stating that the meddling we saw from Russia in the 2016 election   the interference that helped Trump win   could haunt us. According to the top Democrat, it s highly likely that this sort of thing could happen again, maybe as soon as 2018. Schiff said: Only by understanding what the Russians did can we inoculate ourselves from the further Russian interference we know is coming. It was a bombshell of a statement, and the warning became even more clear three hours later, when Comey himself agreed with Schiff during the hearing. Comey said of Russia: They ll be back. They ll be back in 2020, they may be back in 2018, and one of the lessons they may draw from this is that they were successful because they introduced chaos and division and discord and sowed doubt about the nature of this amazing country of ours and our democratic process.It is possible they re misreading that as it worked, and so we ll come back and hit them again in 2020. I don t know. But we have to assume they re coming back. While Comey couldn t give any specific details about whether or not Trump has definitely been involved with Russia, the announcement of the investigation implies that there is evidence. If Trump is found to be connected to Russia and its interference, he will have compromised the country and put America in a severe, unprecedented amount of danger.Featured image via Drew Angerer / Getty Images",News,20-Mar-17
 Republicans PROVE They Believe In Party Over Country With One Incredibly Stupid Question,"Congress is chest-deep in their leak investigations, with FBI Director James Comey in the hot seat today. During the House Intelligence Committee hearing, chairman Devin Nunes thought he d try and ask some really hard-hitting questions, maybe in an attempt to trap Comey into saying something that will incriminate everyone who isn t Republican in the increasingly tangled web that is the Russia scandal.All he did was prove that this is about Republicans desperately puffing up their party instead of actually getting to the bottom of possible treason. And he did it with just one question: If this committee or anyone else for that matter, someone from the public, comes with information to you about the Hillary Clinton campaign, or their associates, or someone from the Clinton Foundation, will you add that to your investigation? Really? He s trying to make this about Hillary, despite consensus that Russia acted in the interest of Trump? It certainly sounded like that s what Nunes was doing when he followed up with: If they have ties to Russian intelligence services, Russian agents, would that be something of interest to you? Comey would not fall into Nunes  trap, though. He replied with: If people bring us information about what they think is improper, unlawful activity of any kind, we will evaluate it. Not just in this context. Folks send us stuff all the time. They should keep doing that. Nunes may well by trying to follow Trump s lead on this, as Trump regularly throws Twitter tantrums in childish attempts to deflect blame. Trump is livid   Comey s statements that the FBI is, indeed, investigating the Russian scandal are infuriating to him. As such, he s still all over Twitter trying to convince us that the real problem is the leaks, and that Hillary s a traitor and a crook and we supposedly all know it, rather than all the evidence piling up against him.What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017Is it a coincidence that Nunes would also ask about Hillary? Likely not. Nunes and the rest of the GOP should give us a call when they re ready to actually go to work.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,20-Mar-17
 Corrupt Republican Blames ‘Deep State’ For His Arrest After Stealing Charity Money,"Something strange happens when the President sees conspiracies everywhere: they tend to bleed into the rest of the government, at least the Republican government. Now, a crooked former GOP Congressman, who s best known for inviting Ted Nugent to President Obama s State of the Union speech, is blaming a Trump-touted conspiracy for the fact the he allegedly stole money for his campaign and personal use and got caught.Former Texas Rep. Steve Stockman blamed the  deep state  on his alleged campaign finance crimes, for which he was arrested. This is part of a deep state that s continuing to progress,  he said after a hearing. Stockman cited a right-wing conspiracy theory that the IRS targeted conservative groups.Stockman is being charged with diverting money from a charitable organization called Life Without Limits to his political campaign and for personal use. Beginning shortly after the $350,000 charitable donation was deposited into his Life Without Limits account, rather than spending the money on the  Freedom House,  Stockman secretly diverted the funds to pay for a variety of personal expenses and to fund illegal contributions to Stockman s campaigns for public office,  court documents filed with the criminal complaint stated.Source: RollcallSince Trump has taken office, we ve seen a lot about the supposed deep state. The deep state is, according to the Oxford Dictionary,  A body of people, typically influential members of government agencies or the military, believed to be involved in the secret manipulation or control of government policy.  Before Trump s election, the term was generally only used by fringe conspiracy theorists and white supremacists who accuse Jewish people of running a shadow government. Now, though, the head of the deep state could be Jewish, but he could also be Barack Obama. Conspiracy theories are fluid like that.Of course, Stockman has a history with the IRS. During the non-scandal scandal that involved the IRS daring to verify the veracity of non-profit statuses (from both sides of the aisle), he called for the arrest of IRS head at the time, Lois Lerner. It s looking more and more like his only reason for wanting Lerner s arrest was to prevent his arrest.Stockman has been released on bond and his main defense is that he stole only $15,000, not $350,000.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,20-Mar-17
 BREAKING: Comey Just Shut Down Trump’s Tweeted Lies In REAL TIME During Hearing (VIDEO),"On Monday, while FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers sat through a grueling, hours-long hearing, Donald Trump was busily thumbing his way to oblivion on Twitter   but some of his tweets got fact-checked in real time.The Donald leaped on an opportunity to speak up for his friend Vladimir Putin when both individuals explained that they did not make an assessment whether or not Russian interference influenced our electoral process The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process. pic.twitter.com/d9HqkxYBt5  President Trump (@POTUS) March 20, 2017Unfortunately for Trump, his claim that the two members of the intelligence community confirmed that Russia did not influence our election was a lie   and he got fact checked just a little later in the hearing. Asked if the tweet is accurate, Comey explained that they have  offered no opinion, have no view, have no information on potential impact because it s never something that we looked at. This, of course, has been the FBI and NSA s position from the beginning and it has not changed. It it shameful that Donald Trump would attempt to misrepresent testimony in this way.

 Stephen Hawking Says He’s Afraid Of Visiting The U.S. Till Trump Is Gone (VIDEO),"Stephen Hawking might be one of the most brilliant and highly respected scientists in the world, but that means nothing in Donald Trump s America. In fact, that sort of thing is a liability, and that s why Hawking has no plans on visiting for the next few years.After receiving the US Franklin medal for science and receiving the presidential medal of freedom from President Obama in 2009, Hawking fears the country s  definite swing to a right-wing more authoritarian approach.  He also fears that he wouldn t be welcome here anymore. I would like to visit again and to talk to other scientists, but I fear that I may not be welcome,  he said in an interview with Good Morning Britain on Monday.Source: The GuardianNaturally, Trump s denial and inaction toward the biggest crisis to hit our planet, manmade climate change, is at the forefront of Hawking s mind. He should replace Scott Pruitt at the Environment Protection Agency,  he said.  Climate change is one of the great dangers we face, and it s one we can prevent. It affects America badly, so tackling it should win votes for his second term. God forbid. As a citizen of the U.K., which recently voted to leave the European Union for reasons very similar to the impetus behind Trump s election, he understands the feeling of being left behind and the fear of globalism, but he doesn t respect it. Trump was elected by people who felt disenfranchised by the governing elite in a revolt against globalisation,  he told ITV1 s breakfast programme.  His priority will be to satisfy his electorate, who are neither liberal nor that well informed. Here s the video: Hawking has reasons to be afraid. Trump s cabinet picks and budget are about as hostile to the scientific community as they can be, but we desperately need people like Hawking to stand up to Trump and to the ignorant masses who elected him. Universities, smart cities and smart rich people, please invite Hawking. The majority of the country doesn t agree with Trump. He will have a warm embrace, although not from our government.Featured image via Bryan Bedder",News,20-Mar-17
 Comey CONFIRMS FBI Investigation Into Trump’s Collusion With Russia During Election (VIDEO),"FBI Director James Comey has confirmed that the agency is not only investigating Russia s interference in the 2016 presidential election but is also taking a long hard look at whether Donald Trump and his campaign colluded with the foreign power.In his opening statement, Comey said that the FBI doesn t usually  confirm the existence of ongoing investigations,  However, if there are  unusual circumstances where it is in the public interest,  that can change. The bureau may, at these times, find it necessary to break with this policy, Comey explained. This is one of those circumstances,  he said. I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. And that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia s efforts,  Comey said.He added that the investigation would  also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed. The most concerning part of Comey s statement came when he said that the investigation was initiated in July of 2016. July. Think about that. Somehow, even though the FBI was investigating Russia s interference in the election on Trump s behalf and whether or not Trump was actually working with Russia, we still ended up with this man sitting in the White House.

 Trump’s SCOTUS Nominee Has DISTURBING History Of Open Misogyny,"We all knew that Donald Trump would be a nightmare for the Supreme Court. His nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, is trying to present himself as some sort of legal scholar who will enforce the law fairly regardless of his personal views. However, his past is coming back to haunt him, and it turns out that he is a a misogynistic bastard   and would make horrific decisions when it comes to protecting women s rights in the workplace. In a letter written to the judiciary, a former student of Judge Gorsuch from his days as a law school professor says the following of his views regarding women in the workplace: Judge Gorsuch outlined how law firms, and companies in general, had to ask female interviewees about pregnancy plans in order to protect the company. At least one student countered that an employer could not ask questions about an interviewee s pregnancy plans. However, Judge Gorsuch informed the class that was wrong. Instead Judge Gorsuch told the class that not only could a future employer ask female interviewees about their pregnancy and family plans, companies must ask females about their family and pregnancy plans to protect the company. Another anonymous declaration to the judiciary also confirmed and complained of Gorsuch s views on working women, saying that he said that many female lawyers became pregnant, and questioned whether they should do so on their law firms  dime. This goes against a ruling from the Court in 2003, which says of asking women about deeply personal issues such as family planning, which says: Historically, denial or curtailment of women s employment opportunities has been traceable directly to the pervasive presumption that women are mothers first, and workers second. This prevailing ideology about women s roles has in turn justified discrimination against women when they are mothers or mothers-to-be. This opinion was authored by Chief Justice Renquist, and it went on to say: These mutually reinforcing stereotypes created a self-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that forced women to continue to assume the role of primary family caregiver, and fostered employers  stereotypical views about women s commitment to work and their value to employees. This should come as no surprise; after all, Trump himself, as well as Mike Pence, are huge misogynists. However, it is downright terrifying. If this guy is confirmed to the Supreme Court, he ll turn back women s rights 100 years. And let s not even get started on women s reproductive health. Roe V. Wade will be gone in a heartbeat with this guy.Democrats, if ever there was an important fight to take on, it s this one. Keep Neil Gorsuch off the Supreme Court, no matter what it takes.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,20-Mar-17

The alleged president s  swamp  now has a Russian accent, with some in his administration revealed to have ties to the hostile foreign government. And that  some  may include Trump himself. On top of that, Trump has been pushing for a travel ban, while initially seeking to stop travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. That executive order was so chaotic that travelers were still in mid-flight when he signed it, then detained at airports. His second attempt to ban Muslims failed in court after he watered it down to forbidding travelers from six countries from entering the U.S. And now Trump is pushing through a health care plan which gifts the rich with tax breaks and hits the elderly hard with pricier coverage.

" The White House Released Trump’s Border Wall Requirements, And They Are Comedy GOLD","Trump just will not stop hammering his border wall as the solution to every problem we ve ever had. In addition to the U.S. government sending  notices of taking  to Texans living along the U.S.-Mexico border, the White House has now released its requirements for the wall. Fox News posted the list to Twitter, and it s just ridiculous.Border wall requirements. pic.twitter.com/AFYG0s5pCS  Fox News (@FoxNews) March 19, 2017At first it looks like this could be a joke, until you see the blue checkmark next to Fox News  Twitter name. These three requirements are hilarious because they re so vague they say absolutely nothing. It s like Fox called Trump up out of the blue, said,  What are the requirements for the border wall,  and Trump replied with,  Oh. Um. Yes. The wall. Yes. Um. Requirements Nothing about a better pricing estimate, what materials they think they need where, how they plan to keep it from interrupting migration patterns or diverting floodwaters, or anything that might actually tell us what the true requirements for this wall are. Just three vague things that demonstrate the Trump administration is more about touting the wall than they are about actually planning for it.The last two are especially odd.  Look good from U.S. side.  It must also look  imposing  from the Mexican side. Aside from the fact that this looks like a toddler wrote it, we do know that nobody wants an eyesore in their backyard.But a 30-ft wall may well be an eyesore anyway no matter how  tasteful  they try and make it look. For instance, those living along the Rio Grande, where their view is of a river and they re closely intertwined with sister cities in Mexico, are likely to suffer both from the eyesore that is a giant wall. Are they going to build it out of Plexiglas to avoid interrupting views? No. It has to look  imposing  from the far side.In reality, some communities might benefit from rising property values, while others would suffer grievously when their local economies crash as people from their sister cities can t come across to shop anymore. The way it looks won t help the communities that are going to suffer regardless. Difficult to climb or cut through.  Well duh. Really? They ve been saying the entire time that the whole point of having a wall is to keep people from being able to climb over it or cut through it like they can in places along the existing fence. But people will still climb it, people will still tunnel under it, and some might find ways around them via the oceans.When you consider the fact that most undocumented immigrants entered the U.S. legally on a visitor visa, and then just never left, it makes  difficult to climb or cut through  seem even more absurd. It would be nice to know what the administration believes this wall will truly require in terms of, well, everything, since we re the ones who are going to pay for it. But it would be even nicer if they d drop it altogether, since our tax dollars are going towards a massive waste of time, money and resources.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images ",News,19-Mar-17
 Even The Pope Is F*cking Trump Up On Twitter (TWEETS),"Donald Trump has taken a beating on his favorite playground   Twitter   from many notable individuals (and multiple dictionaries), so the Pope decided to try to reach The Donald that way.Pope Francis has tried in every way possible to reach Trump, including a direct inauguration-day message and multiple statements indirectly condemning the policies of our resident Manchurian couch potato, all to no avail.

Pope Francis (@Pontifex) March 18, 2017At around the time the White House announced the budget   one that guts social programs like Meals on Wheels that are aimed at helping the disadvantaged   was announced, the Pope reminded everyone that people who actually follow the teachings of the Bible love life,  especially when it is weak and vulnerable.  Of course, this could easily be a reference to the GOP s ongoing effort to strip healthcare from our most poor and vulnerable.The word of God helps us to open our eyes to welcome and love life, especially when it is weak and vulnerable.

 Federal Lawsuit Filed Against Trump Over Financial Disclosure (DETAILS),"It looks like Donald Trump can add another case to the list of lawsuits he is facing. An attorney, based in Washington, D.C., has filed suit in federal court alleging that the financial disclosure Trump filed in May 2016 was not even close to accurate.Jeffrey Lovitky filed the lawsuit on March 14. According to Politico, Trump mixed his personal liabilities in with his business liabilities, making it impossible for voters to get a true picture of his potential conflicts of interest. The purpose of these disclosure requirements is to allow members of the public to make informed judgments as to whether candidates for federal office have financial conflicts of interests that may impair their ability to faithfully execute their duties as public servants,  Lovitky explained in the complaint.Lovitky s suit does not accuse Trump of any improprieties, but it does allege that the public has not been given truthful information regarding Trump s many debts due to the lack of clarity in the financial disclosure. If you just look at the statement on its face, all those liabilities are assumed to be personal liabilities, but I just do not think that s the case. I have information that says otherwise,  Lovitky said during an interview with Politico.When Lovitky was asked why he decided to pursue this issue in court, he said that when it comes to Trump, there are  very serious concerns about conflicts of interest. It s mostly the fact that with this president there are very serious concerns about conflicts of interest in this particular administration, and I think it s important that those concerns be addressed thoroughly,  the attorney explained.Lovitky is not seeking damages in the suit and is only asking the court to declare Trump s financial disclosure illegal and order him to file a new one that accurately represents his personal debts. Currently, his next financial closure is not scheduled to be released until May 2018. U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who was appointed by Bill Clinton, has been assigned the case.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,19-Mar-17
" Trump’s ‘Major Meeting’ On Veterans Affairs Never Took Place, But He Did Play Golf","A  major meeting  on veterans affairs didn t happen yesterday evening despite Trump s announcement earlier in the day.Watch:Trump asks VA @SecShulkin if he's going to Mar-a-Lago. Shulkin shakes his head. pic.twitter.com/aZyiBC9Gnj  POLITICO (@politico) March 17, 2017The White House hasn t given any reason for the change in plans, but it must not have been Trump s bad feet, which prevented him from serving his country in Vietnam because he did manage to get some golf in.The most likely reason is that Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin wasn t planning to attend, as he indicated with a shake of his head in the above video   something Trump didn t seem to be aware of or care about. This didn t stop other veteran advocates like Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter from going. Why was Shulkin such a schtick in the mud? Maybe it s because the meeting was due to be held at Mar-a-Lago, Trump s West Palm Beach golf castle, and Shulkin didn t have his shots.Speaking of Mar-a-Lago, this is Trump s fifth weekend there since his inauguration five weekends ago. Check this out:The diagram shows how much time Trump spends playing hooky from the  northern White House.  Good work if you can get it.Trump has spent nearly a quarter of his time at Mar-a-Lago since taking office. A lot of elderly people like to go to the Sunshine state when they need a break.By the way, who s paying for the $3M a pop to the  southern White House?  Not veterans programs, at least, not yet. The Department of Veterans Affairs is penciled in for a 6% bump in Trump s budget proposal, which is currently facing a rocky road in the ongoing Federal budget process. As far as fiscal 2017 goes, most departments have been operating on a continuing budget resolution good through the end of April. If things aren t ironed out by then, the resulting partial government shutdown shouldn t affect most veterans services significantly, since VA funding has already been approved.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,19-Mar-17
 NATO Ambassador Just SHAMED Trump – Had To Educate Him On How NATO Works,"Donald Trump just got his ass handed to him by a former NATO Ambassador for claiming that Germany owes the organization money.On Saturday, Trump attacked Germany by accusing them of shortchanging NATO and owing money to the United States for defense.Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Nevertheless, Germany owes ..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2017 vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2017Once again, Trump demonstrated that he has no clue how NATO works and totally embarrassed himself by attacking an ally.Not only did German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen shoot down Trump s claims by pointing out that Germany has  no debt account at NATO,  a former American NATO Ambassador stepped up and thoroughly humiliated Trump by educating him on how NATO works in a series of tweets.1/ Sorry, Mr. President, that s not how NATO works. The US decides for itself how much it contributes to defending NATO. pic.twitter.com/8svkzRBEQb  Ivo Daalder (@IvoHDaalder) March 18, 20172/ This is not a financial transaction, where NATO countries pay the US to defend them. It is part of our treaty commitment.  Ivo Daalder (@IvoHDaalder) March 18, 20173/ All NATO countries, including Germany, have committed to spend 2% of GDP on defense by 2024. So far 5 of 28 NATO countries do.  Ivo Daalder (@IvoHDaalder) March 18, 20174/ Those who currently don t spend 2% of their GDP on defense are now increasing their defense budgets.

Ivo Daalder (@IvoHDaalder) March 18, 2017As Ivo Daalder just explained, the commitment to NATO spending is a long-term plan that will occur by 2024. The deadline is fixed and Trump cannot force other nations to pay what he wants them to pay.Also, the United States does not run NATO. It s a defense pact between our nation and the nations of Europe designed for mutual defense and cooperation against threats to Europe and North America. But Trump seems to think that it s an American operated security business or something.Trump is the most inept president in our history and he continues to prove it every time he opens his big mouth.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,19-Mar-17
 Trump Supporter Threatens To Slaughter Black People Because A Guy Was Mean To Him On Facebook (VIDEO),"Ever since Officer Darren Wilson murdered unarmed African-American teen Michael Brown in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, Trump supporter James Stachowiak has been threatening African-Americans, even attempting to organize a posse to shoot black people    animals  and  n*ggers  as Stachowiak calls them   peacefully protesting the GOP convention last year. According to this self-described  patriot,  black women and children (who should be shot  in the backs  according to the right-wing activist) who were seen exiting stores in Ferguson during the protests because they may or may not be looting.Naturally, African-Americans aren t exactly fond of the guy who has been leveling threats at an entire race for years. After Stachowiak told his fellow conservatives to  prepare to kill  anyone who punches a Nazi in America, a black man who goes by the name Frank Luc on Facebook messaged Stachowiak, informing him that he will gladly punch him in the face   and if Stachowiak pulls a gun, it will not end well for him. While we can never endorse threats against anyone, the anger this gentleman feels toward a racist white man who has threatened to kill quite literally any African-American who does something he does not like is justified.Stachowiak, being a thin-skinned bully, quickly published a video on his Instagram threatening Mr. Luc   and, once again, black people in general. I will kill him,  Stachowiak said in a video filmed while he was driving.  I will kill you Frank if you so much as set in front of my house even on a public street. I will fill your car with so much rounds they won t be able to tell if if was a vehicle anymore. Then his threats became more general. He informed Frank that he will be  hunted  if he successfully defends himself against a premeditated gun attack and that  anyone between you and the hunters will be acceptable collateral damage. We re done with Black Lives Matter aren t we Frank?  Stachowiak continued.  We re gonna start cleaning it up starting with you Frank. In case you missed it, because someone was mean to him on the internet, Stachowiak threatened to ethnically cleanse black people. Regardless of anyone s opinion of Frank s message to Stachowiak, it is chilling that he would plot to kill an entire race of people because of one man s words.Watch the video below:featured image via screengrab",News,19-Mar-17
 WATCH: Paul Ryan Gets His A** Handed To Him By Fox Host On GOP Healthcare Plan,"Even Fox News understands that the Republican healthcare bill will leave millions of Americans in financial ruins.That s why Chris Wallace put the screws to House Speaker Paul Ryan on Sunday.So far, the GOP healthcare bill has been universally panned and Republicans who still support the bill are struggling to defend it.The bill will not only strip health insurance from tens of millions of Americans, it will make the cost of healthcare skyrocket, especially among senior citizens whose costs are projected to be ten times what they pay now under the Affordable Care Act.During an interview on Fox News Sunday, Wallace pointed out to Ryan that the GOP healthcare bill would force senior citizens with an annual income of $26,500 to spend $14,600 a year on health insurance instead of the $1,700 they currently spend thanks to subsidies provided by the Affordable Care Act.Wallace then slammed Ryan for saying that the GOP plan is  what freedom looks like,  even though seniors would be forced to spend over half of their income on healthcare. That s definitely NOT freedom. You said that part of that is that this is what freedom looks like,  Wallace began.  But is the major decrease in the number of people   according to the CBO   who will have health insurance, is it freedom or is it that some people will no longer be able to afford health insurance under your plan? This isn t freedom,  Wallace continued.  This isn t people voluntarily deciding not to have health insurance. It s that your plan makes it unaffordable for people. Ryan responded by going on an incoherent rant about how the Affordable Acre Act is  not going to last,  even though Republican sabotage is the reason why the Affordable Care Act is having problems in the first place. And then he started talking about how the GOP bill will make insurance plans less expensive even though Wallace just got done telling him the exact opposite. We re not going to make people buy something that s so expensive that they can t afford, that the market is not going to offer,  Ryan said.  And so where I dispute that comparison is it suggests that we re going to have the same kinds of plans being offered in 10 years that Obamacare would otherwise offer. The person in their 50s or 60s does have additional health care costs than, say, a person in their 20s and 30s You re right in saying   and we agree   we believe we should have even more assistance and that s one of the things we re looking at for that person in their 50s and 60s. We re going to let people buy what they want to buy,  Ryan continued.  We re going to have more plans being offered, more choice and competition. He also claimed that gutting healthcare regulations would cause prices to drop.Here s the video via YouTube:Ryan s argument in defense of Trumpcare is that the CBO didn t examine everything. The problem is that if they had the GOP plan would have looked even worse.Getting rid of regulations won t make healthcare more affordable. It just gives insurance companies more freedom to screw over their customers.As the GOP healthcare bill currently stands, senior citizens will end up paying ten times as much for healthcare than they do now.The Affordable Care Act created competition among health insurance companies and slowed down the rising cost of premiums while covering tens of millions of Americans who previously could not afford coverage.The GOP bill repeals all of that and Ryan s defense was not only confusing, it was full of empty promises in a desperate effort to convince the American people that Republicans care about them.Featured image via screenshot",News,19-Mar-17
 WATCH: Republican Senator Admits That Trumpcare Bill Won’t Lower Health Insurance Premiums,"While the Affordable Care Act actually has slowed down the rising cost of premiums, the Republican healthcare bill that repeals it definitely won t.And Republican Senator Tom Cotton openly admitted it on Sunday during an interview on CNN.Ever since House Republicans unveiled their legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act it has been panned by Democrats and Republicans alike. Donald Trump thinks it s  wonderful,  but the American people are outraged because the bill would strip healthcare from tens of millions and would cause the cost of healthcare to skyrocket, especially among senior citizens and those with low incomes.The bottom line is that this is a terrible bill that will hurt millions of Americans who need affordable access to health insurance.Jake Tapper specifically asked Cotton whether he would keep the Medicaid expansion considering he represents Arkansas, one of the poorest states in the nation.Of course, Cotton seems to think that the only people who get Medicaid are people who are unemployed.Cotton said that he supports a Medicaid  transformation  bill in which  able-bodied  adults are not allowed to be covered by the program. He basically told them to get a job and pay for their own healthcare. The problem is that many of those able-bodied adults actually do have jobs. They just don t get paid enough to afford health insurance. And then Cotton admitted that the GOP bill will not bring the cost of premiums down, thus confirming a major problem with the bill The Medicaid expansion I think needs to be part of Medicaid transformation and that s what the House bill moved forward. It can be improved to some degree, but it s about a 70% or 80% solution, Jake. The bigger problem with this legislation is on the private insurance market. I simply think that it s not going to work to bring down premiums for working Arkansans or working Americans around the country. Here s the video via YouTube. Cotton s remarks on healthcare are at the 3 minute mark:The Affordable Care Act is not perfect but it s far superior to anything Republicans have offered. Trumpcare will hurt millions of Americans and do nothing to bring the cost of care down. And while the wealthy will get a tax cut from the GOP bill, low income Americans will only be saddled with a financial burden. They would once again live in fear that a major health crisis could leave them bankrupt and homeless. No one should have to live that way.Featured image via screenshot",News,19-Mar-17
 As Trump Takes 6th Golf Trip As President The Vow He Made To NEVER Take A Vacation Goes Viral (VIDEO),"Trump spent his the sixth weekend golfing and the internet dug up an supremely uncomfortable reminder for him.And Trump seems oblivious to the fact that most Americans find the idea of a president taking six vacations in his first two months of being president repugnant. Donning golfing attire, Trump smiled and posed for the cameras in Mar-a-Lago.Shamelessly:The photo itself represented a Trump lie. His staff had told reporters that he was heading to his nearby golf course for the purpose of  having meetings and phone calls.  The president himself said he would be spending the night having an important discussion about veteran affairs. Hours later, no specific meetings were ever reported to have taken place and the  veteran affairs  dinner was suddenly cancelled. All that remained was Trump s time spent playing golf at the golf course that he owns next to the resort that he also owns.Which is a nice  screw you  to the rest of us. His trips to the links cost more money each visit than most of the life-saving programs he proposed gutting spend all year. And because he s doing so as president, the taxpayers are footing the bill to enable it.(RT!) Trump golfing at Mar-a-Lago costs $10 million/mo. The National Endowment for the Arts costs $12 million/mo. Guess which is being cut? pic.twitter.com/1ZAlRDBrPb  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) March 17, 2017It's incomprehensible that Trump wants to kill Meals on Wheels, when one trip to Mar-a-lago costs taxpayers the same as feeding 500k elderly pic.twitter.com/fg3FozZdsX  Nick Bilton (@nickbilton) March 18, 2017Which may be why this video of Trump promising not to every take a vacation as president is particularly insane. He told voters he wouldn t have time for vacations and added that he would probably never leave the White House, because of all the serious work to be done.You hear that Trump didn t hoodwink voters (they knew what they were getting!) and then find clips like this. Just breathtaking hypocrisy. pic.twitter.com/LDnb3Xr7oF  Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) March 18, 2017 There s no time for vacations,  Trump said as a stone-faced Chris Christie sat next to him.  We re not going to be big on vacations.  Vacations are arguably the only thing Trump is big on as president.He s taken so many vacations that in two months he s already cost taxpayers roughly the same amount of money the Obamas did all year for vacations. The hypocrisy is so bad that it may explain why Trump is desperate to rebrand his Florida resort as the  Southern White House.  You can t say you re not at the White House if you simply rename your vacation house  The White House. Let s see if American voters are dumb enough to buy that.Featured image via screenshot",News,18-Mar-17
" Trump Voter SHOCKED That He’s Gutting Meals On Wheels, The Rest Of Us Aren’t (VIDEO)","If you haven t heard, the Trump administration is making conservative wet dreams come true by gutting every social program imaginable   including Meals on Wheels, which provides elderly and disabled people with food and occasional company. This development is not shocking to most of us, but 56-year-old Georgia resident Linda Preast somehow had no idea this sort of thing would happen when she voted for a gigantic orange billionaire with a long history of telling the poor to f*ck off.Preast has been wheelchair-bound since she had a stroke two years ago and relies on Meals on Wheels for food. But now that it s not just about building a wall and getting all those damn Muslims out of the country, now that sh*t is getting real, Preast is realizing she may have made a mistake.Are you surprised?  CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller asked Preast about the cuts to the Meals on Wheels program. Yeah,  Preast said.  Because he was told   I was under the influence that he was going to help us. To be clear, there was never any reason to think Donald Trump would help anyone outside his tax bracket. We can t spend money on programs just because they sound good. And Meals on Wheels sounds great,  says White House Budget director Mick Mulvaney, who calls the cuts to Meals on Wheels and other programs designed to help the less fortunate  compassionate. Asked what she would tell Donald Trump to convince him not to cut funding to a program that helps her, Preast replied What if it was your momma? But it s not Donald Trump s  momma  and he doesn t care about the majority of Americans   even his supporters.While the government has decided that a program that feeds 2.4 million people a year  doesn t work,  Americans disagree. Ever since the budget was announced, donations have been pouring in from people who desperately want to save a program that helps so many. The program has seen a 500 percent increase in volunteers and a 50 percent increase in online donations, but it s still not enough. The scary thing about that is that funding is already not keeping up with pace,  Jenny Bertolette, vice president of communications for Meals on Wheels America says.  There are already demands that we can t meet. There is already a waitlist crisis   If this budget was enacted, it would obviously just make matters so much worse.

 Apparently Trump’s Administration Hasn’t Heard Of F*cking LoJack,"We re not sure how this could have possibly happened. I mean, how does one allow a laptop to be stolen which contains sensitive information? Even more disconcerting is, how the hell did a Secret Service agent possibly let someone stroll in, take their sh*t, then stroll away. The Secret Service-issued laptop in question contained floor plans for Trump Tower, information about the Hillary Clinton email investigation and other national security information. But all of that has gone bye bye.On Thursday morning, the computer was taken in the Brooklyn area and officials are trying to determine if Agent Marie Argentieri was targeted or if the robbery was random, according to the Daily News. We re going to go with  targeted  for $100, Alex. It s a very big deal,  a police source said.  There s data on there that s highly sensitive. They re scrambling like mad. Scrambling? You can just look up the GPS location of the device there are services for that. Services which apparently the highest levels of government don t use. If you lose a cellphone, you can track it better than the Secret Service can track a missing laptop.Sources and neighbors say that the thief, a white man who was dressed in black, stepped out of a dark-colored sedan, possibly an Uber, then went into Argentieri s Bath Beach driveway at about 3: a.m. (We told you it was targeted.)The black-clad then grabbed the computer, a backpack, and other goods then walked away, according to sources. After that, to make his getaway, the thief did not get back into the car he arrived in, but instead, surveillance video shows him strolling away from the brick home wearing a backpack and holding a laptop. It showed somebody running to the car and running back out,  a neighbor, Mike Miguolo, 73, said.  They knew what they were doing, absolutely. They knew what they were hitting. This is what was stolen:Other items stolen include  sensitive  documents, an access keycard, coins, a black zippered bag with the Secret Service insignia on it and lapel pins from various assignments   including ones involving President Trump, the Clinton campaign, the United Nations General Assembly and the Pope s visit to New York, sources said.In addition, an agency-issued radio was also taken. Secret Service issued laptops contain multiple layers of security including full disk encryption and are not permitted to contain classified information,  the Secret Service said in a statement.A second White House fence jumper was taken into custody today. Maybe he wanted to return the laptop. IDK For the record, there is LoJack for laptops. We re just trying to be helpful. Trump could inform his administration of certain precautionary steps to take in order to ensure that highly sensitive data is not stolen, however, the former reality show star uses an unsecured Android.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,18-Mar-17
 This Trumpcare Provision Will Let Trump Further Enrich Himself While He’s In Office (DETAILS),"One of the things that makes Trumpcare such a blow job for the rich is that it contains a bunch of cuts to taxes that help pay for certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Some of those taxes were primarily on the wealthy, which we all know is totally unfair.One such tax was a 3.8 percent tax on  unearned income,  including real-estate income   something that Trump could avoid when he was actively managing his businesses. However, now that he s in the White House and not actively managing those businesses, he s subject to that tax and the GOP wants to repeal it.It s the biggest tax cut contained within the clusterfuck that is the Trumpcare/Ryancare bill.That means there s massive tax break that will help Trump line his pockets   while he s still in the White House according to the Wall Street Journal: Up until he became president, he would have met the definition of being an active real estate professional,  said Joe Perry, partner-in-charge at the accounting firm Marcum LLP. Now, as president,  he would probably not meet the definition. In terms of his rental income, he would have been largely unaffected by repeal  if he were still a private citizen, said Tony Nitti, an accountant at Withum Smith & Brown.  There s no just practical way he can qualify as a real-estate professional now that he s president of the United States. Because he doesn t qualify as a real-estate professional anymore, he has to pay this tax on his businesses. The tax, however, contains a loophole for people actively managing certain types of businesses, so as a private citizen, he didn t have to pay it.Repealing this tax will send more income to Trump, and up to the top 1 percent of households in the country while ripping health insurance from people who can t afford it. The whole plan is nothing but cold-blooded fuckery intended to help the rich while punishing everyone who has the audacity to not be rich.Which is something we already knew because that s how Republicans roll, but for the man who calls himself the president to personally benefit while he s in office is just beyond the pale.Featured image by Justin Sullivan via Getty Images",News,18-Mar-17

 Jake Tapper Burns Trump With Bill Maher: He Is ‘Empirically Indecent’ (VIDEO),"A lot about America has changed since the rise of Donald Trump. People thought that his coarse language, his clear racism and misogyny, and just generally appalling behavior would render him unacceptable to the American public. Yet, here we are. Donald Trump is president, and his young administration has fundamentally changed how the world views America, its citizens, and its government. One thing that hasn t changed though is the way some strident and brave media personalities continue to speak truth to power and insist on making sure that Trump s disgusting ways, his incompetence, and his lies don t fundamentally change who we are as a people. Perhaps the breakout star in that regard is CNN s Jake Tapper.Tapper hosts The Lead during the week, and State of the Union on Sunday mornings. On Friday night, the fiery host stopped by HBO s Real Time to have a chat with host Bill Maher. Of course, Maher had to ask about the changes Tapper has had to make now that there s the biggest liar on earth occupying the Oval Office. Tapper responded: You ve been covering politicians for a long time. Politicians lie. It wasn t invented on Jan. 20. I ve never seen this level of falsehood, quantitatively. Tapper went on to distinguish between what happens with say, falsehoods that happened with the Obama Administration such as,  If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.  He says of the lies coming out of the Trump White House: It s conspiracy theories based on nothing that have members of his own party distancing themselves from him. Then the conversation turns to Trump s vulgarity and other fundamental affronts to basic human decency in public discourse. Tapper says of the way Trump behaved on the campaign trail and how he continues to behave: The truth of the matter is that there is no bias when it comes to facts and there s no bias when it comes to decency. It s empirically indecent to make fun of the disabled. That s just indecent. My children know better than that. The two hosts then went on to reference what we all know   which is that most of the fundamental things that make Trump so awful, we all learn not to do in grade school. Maher says:I always think about that book  Everything I Needed to Know I learned in Kindergarten.  He violates every rule. Don t lie, don t accuse people of things they re not guilty of. Don t boast. Pay your taxes. Serve your country. Don t be a racist, don t insult   like you say   the handicapped people or other people who are not as lucky to be as great looking as you are, Donald. And yet, in spite of all of these things, people still voted for this fundamentally indecent, sorry excuse for a human being. That says things about this nation that we really need to examine, should we survive this nightmare of a  presidency. Watch the video below:Featured image via Scott Eisen/Getty Images",News,18-Mar-17
 House Committee Uncovers DAMNING BOMBSHELL – Russia PAID Michael Flynn To Appear With Putin,"It s easy to think the whole brouhaha with Michael Flynn was over the moment he was forced from his post as Trump s national security adviser, but it s not. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been investigating Flynn and his connections with Russia, and they just found something incredibly damning.RT, a state-run news network in Russia, paid Flynn to attend a gala in Moscow with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, released records that include checks, invoices and emails showing that RT literally paid Flynn nearly $34,000 to attend the function.And not too long afterward, he was busy advising Trump and his campaign in a voluntary capacity. Not only was he paid a speaking fee at the gala, but his company, Leading Authorities, received $11,250 from that gala. All told, Flynn was paid $56,250 to appear with Putin and do work for two Russian firms, all while he was acting in an advisory capacity with Donald Trump.Some of that involved a Russian company, Kaspersky Lab, which is a subsidiary of a Russian company that specializes in  uncovering Western government spyware.  In other words, evidence shows that he worked for a company that works against not just the U.S., but also against all our NATO allies. Kaspersky Lab claims it has no ties to any government, but  is proud to collaborate with the authorities of many countries,  in fighting against cybercrimes.Cybercrimes like hacking the DNC to help tilt our election to Trump s favor, maybe? If this isn t corruption by a foreign power, then what is? Democrats on the House Oversight Committee now want an additional investigation into these payments because the come from companies based in Russia.We already know Flynn was acting as a foreign agent in Turkey while working for Trump s campaign, and that he failed to disclose that until just recently. But now we see he was working with Russia, too. It s high time we learned just how deep this goes. It s not likely that Flynn was a solo actor here. The entire Trump administration must be thoroughly investigated   we can t allow Flynn to serve as their scapegoat.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images",News,18-Mar-17
 WATCH: Fox SCRAMBLES To Refute Wiretapping Claim After Trump Throws Them Under The Bus,"Fox News found themselves in a really uncomfortable position on Friday because of Donald Trump s gullibility.During a Fox News broadcast on Tuesday, Andrew Napolitano attempted to defend Trump s continuing insistence that President Obama wiretapped him by accusing the British intelligence agency GCHQ of wiretapping Trump after being ordered to do so by Obama.Just like Trump s original accusation, Napolitano s accusation was just as wild and baseless. Yet, White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer repeated it as gospel without providing any evidence to back up the claim.In a rare statement issued by the GCHQ, the agency angrily refuted the accusation. Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct  wiretapping  against the then president-elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored. The international incident reportedly forced Spicer and National Security Adviser McMaster to issue a formal apology to the United Kingdom, even though Spicer and Trump have not publicly backed away from the accusation in the United States.The embarrassing incident was rightfully brought up by reporters during a joint press conference on Friday attended by Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.When asked if the White House made a mistake blaming the British, Trump literally blamed his favorite propaganda network for the an accusation his team repeated, thus throwing them under the bus. Trump also had the audacity to claim his team made no such allegation even though his team openly repeated it as if it somehow proved Trump s original accusation. We said nothing,  Trump said.  All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox. So you shouldn t be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox. Here s the video via Twitter.Wow. Trump to Merkel about alleged wiretapping by Obama:  At least we have something in common, perhaps.  She appears to be very confused. pic.twitter.com/la4p9ZJGvo  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 17, 2017Almost immediately, Fox News rushed to reverse the damage as anchor Shep Smith told the world that Napolitano was full of shit. Fox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano s commentary,  Smith said.  Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now-President of the United States was surveilled at any time in any way. Full stop. And then Fox anchor Bret Baier chimed in later in the day by repeating that Napolitano s claim cannot be confirmed. We love the judge, we love him here at Fox, but the Fox News division was never able to back up those claims and was never reported on this show,  Baier reported.While Napolitano was irresponsible for pitching such an accusation, Donald Trump was even more irresponsible by letting Spicer repeat it without any verification of the accuracy of the claim. All Trump had to do is direct his team to make contact with British intelligence and ask if the claim is true or not. But Trump failed to do so because he is flailing for anything that could even suggest in the slightest that his accusation against President Obama is true. But the accusation is clearly false because if Trump really had any proof he would have released it by now. Even Republican leaders in Congress have confirmed that Trump s claim is a lie.So it looks like the honeymoon may be over between Trump and Fox News. It s probably safe to say that Fox News will put a leash on what their commentators say about Trump s wiretapping fiasco. Now we just have to wait and see if Fox News starts to turn on Trump.Featured Image: Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,17-Mar-17
 WATCH: Trump FUMES In Silence As Irish Prime Minister Shames Him In Front Of Reporters,"As he was standing next to podium, Donald Trump must have been throwing a silent temper tantrum as Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny humiliated him and his anti-immigrant policy.St. Patrick s Day may have been a complete bummer this year because of Trump, but during an event at the White House honoring the holiday, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny gave the world something to smile about as he delivered remarks about immigration that made Trump fume on the sidelines.Unable to rudely stop the Irish leader, Trump had to listen as Kenny talked about immigration and how immigrants came to America and made our country stronger despite bigots who looked down upon them. It s fitting that we gather here each year to celebrate St. Patrick and his legacy,  Kenny began.  He, too, of course, was an immigrant. And even though he is, of course, the patron saint of Ireland, for many people around the globe, he is also the symbol of   indeed, the patron of   immigrants. Here in America, in your great country, 35 million people claim Irish heritage,  Kenny continued as Trump scowled and squirmed.  And the Irish have contributed to the economic, social, political and cultural life of this great country over the last 200 years. Kenny then pointed out that Irish immigrants were also unwelcome in America as people blamed them for crime and lack of jobs just as Donald Trump and Republicans are blaming Latinos today. Ireland came to America because, deprived of liberty, deprived of opportunity, of safety, and even food itself, the Irish believed, and four decades before Lady Liberty lifted her lamp we were the retched refuse on the teeming shore. We believed in the shelter of America, in the compassion of America, in the opportunity of America. Here s the video via Twitter. We were the wretched refuse on the teeming shore,  Irish prime minister says with Donald Trump in the room. pic.twitter.com/7jEfTVvIzE  Barry Malone (@malonebarry) March 17, 2017Indeed, millions of immigrants came to this country with nothing in order to pursue better lives for themselves and their families just as immigrants continue to do so today. But Trump has made the American Dream a nightmare for millions of immigrants as he continues to persecute Latinos and Muslims.And the Irish Prime Minister just cleverly shamed Donald Trump in the most epic and stealthy way for it.Featured image via screenshot",News,17-Mar-17
 Trump’s Wealthcare Plan Set To FAIL As Yet Another Republican Breaks Ranks,"One after another, Republicans are breaking ranks with their party and saying they just can t throw their support behind the GOP s appalling excuse for a healthcare plan. With so many conservatives jumping ship, it is starting to look more and more likely that the American Health Care Act is set to fail.Bloomberg reporter Steven Dennis reported on Friday that Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) issued a statement saying he cannot support the Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare in its current form. It is estimated that the AHCA would result in 24 million people losing their insurance coverage by 2026, with 14 million of these people finding themselves without health care by the end of the year.Heller said he agrees with Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, who recently joined with Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to argue that the GOP plan would be disastrous in states that had expanded Medicaid. Heller said that he just can t support the AHCA  in its current form. ! HELLER does not support the American Health Care Act  in its current from,  agrees with Gov. SANDOVAL.  Steven Dennis (@StevenTDennis) March 17, 2017It is looking like the AHCA, even if it manages to pass the House, will crash and burn in the Senate. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) said on Thursday that she will not support the bill as it is written. Several other Republican senators have criticized the bill, including Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT).

" Trump Has The Most UNCOMFORTABLE Moment With Merkel, Makes A FOOL Of Himself (VIDEO)","Earlier today, Donald Trump had a joint conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and he used it as an opportunity to embarrass himself (and the rest of the United States) in front of yet another world leader. Sadly, this is a pattern that the once highly respected America is becoming used to.When Trump was asked if he regretted some of his tweets, particularly his insane wiretapping accusations against former President Barack Obama, Trump failed miserably in his attempt to handle the situation and redeem himself with Merkel, who he d been criticizing for the past few months after she allowed Syrian refugees into her country.Trump stated that he  very seldom  regrets the things he posts on Twitter, right before turning to Merkel and making a reference to the unfounded wiretapping accusation he created. Trump suggested that perhaps the two of them had something in common, in an attempt to make a joke about Obama s surveillance of Germany s administration and press. The problem was, it took several moments for anyone in the audience to get the joke, and the tension in the room was nothing but awkward and uncomfortable as everyone tried to figure out just what the hell Trump was talking about.You can watch this strange moment unfold below, thanks to MSNBC:This humiliating moment was just one of the memorable instances between Merkel and Trump today. Trump embarrassed himself again during a sit-down meeting with the German chancellor by turning down her offer to shake hands, making himself seem even more offensive and rude than ever before. Considering Trump s horrendous track record with women, he couldn t have chosen a more disrespectful thing to do. Then again, I guess we should all be thankful that he didn t grab her by the p*ssy.Trump continues to make the U.S. look horrible in front of other countries, and it s only been two months. I don t even want to think about the damage he could do to our reputation in four years. Hopefully, he won t last that long.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,17-Mar-17
" Paul Ryan Reveals That In College, He Was A Cruel, Cruel Drunk","College is the time to dream. For many, it s also the time to party. Paul Ryan was no exception, only surrounded by idealists, the future Speaker of the House dreamt of a dystopian world where being poor was a crime worthy of death.You think I m exaggerating? During an ideas summit from National Review, Ryan sat down with the magazine s publisher and reminisced about his college days.Lowry: You have been very clear for years and we ve seen compelling PowerPoint presentations about how the entitlements and entitlements growing out of control is driving the country into a ditch on the debt. And we have a president of the United States who basically seems pledged not to touch entitlements. Where does that leave us?Ryan: So, the health care entitlements are the big, big, big drivers of our debt. There are three. Obamacare, Medicaid, and Medicare. Two out of three are going through Congress right now. So, Medicaid sending it back to the states, capping its growth rate. We ve been dreaming of this since you and I were drinking out of a keg. [Laughter]Lowry: I was thinking about something else, he was thinking about reforming Medicaid.Ryan: I was, I was! I ve been thinking about this for a long time. We are on the cusp of doing something we ve long believed in.Awww, what a sweet story.Don t let the irony of Ryan s college dreams escape you. He only attended college because he was on the government dole. In fact, he s pretty much always been on the government dole.Rep. Paul Ryan, the GOP s most outspoken advocate for cutting and privatizing Social Security, has already benefited from Social Security himself, in the form of survivor benefits he received after his father s untimely death.From the age of 16, when his 55-year-old father died of a heart attack, until he was 18, Ryan received Social Security payments, which, according to a lengthy profile in WI Magazine, he put away for college. The eventual budget czar attended Miami University in Ohio to earn a B.A. in economics and political science, and landed a congressional internship as a junior.Ryan s congressional ascent, all the way to the top spot on the Budget Committee, began with his Social Security-funded college education.Source: Raw StoryWhile Ryan is in complete denial of all the government money he s been given throughout the years, his dreams do have real life consequences. According to the Congressional Budget Office, Ryan s healthcare plan will steal access to healthcare from about 24 million people, but who are we to argue with a drunken college dream?Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,17-Mar-17
 Former Tea Party Congressman Brought In Court In Shackles And Handcuffs On Felony Charge,"Former Texas Republican Rep. Steve Stockman s Twitter handle is @SteveWorks4You but apparently he works for himself. Stockman, who served who served two stints in the U.S. House of Representatives, spent part of Friday in federal court after being brought in on charges of violating federal election law during his last term in office. The former tea party Congressman was brought into court shackled and handcuffed, KPRC reports.Stockman is accused of conspiring to violate federal election laws during his last term in office   a felony that could send him to federal prison if he s convicted. Judge Stephen Smith set the bail at $25,000.Prosecutors alleged as Stockmen stood before the judge that the former tea party Congressman had conspired with two former employees to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars to his personal use.The complaint states that in 2011 Stockman set up a non-profit called Life Without Limits in Las Vegas. After a single contributor donated $350,000 to the charity, Stockman then allegedly funneled back to himself through donations made by his employees.Stockman is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump s. In 2016 he tweeted the following:I served on thewhitewater investigation in the 90's. Anybody in the phone book would b better & more honest than a Clinton. @RealJamesWoods  Steve Stockman (@SteveWorks4You) May 7, 2016And today, Stockman was in handcuffs.KPRC reports:When Stockman was told he would need to have an attorney by 2 p.m Friday, he said  I ll have to hustle with that. Smith responded  Yeah, you will. These are serious charges. In 2013, it was revealed that Stockman s 2011 and 2012 income was listed as $350,000 in salary and fees from an entity called  Presidential Trust Marketing.  No one knows just what Presidential Trust Marketing is or does, though. The loud-mouthed, attention-seeking former Congressman, also an accountant, failed to make federally required disclosures about business affiliations that stretch from Texas to the British Virgin Islands. We don t know if that relates to the charges today, but it s odd that Stockman keeps mishandling the same amount of money: $350,000.Stockman left Congress after a failed primary challenge against Sen. John Cornyn in 2014 after serving two terms.Photo: Gage Skidmore via Flickr, allowable under Creative Commons license",News,17-Mar-17
 Here’s What Happens When Children Win A Science Contest In Trump’s America (VIDEO),"In Indiana, schools staged a robotics competition for fourth graders. The winning team was comprised of two African-American children and three Latino children, ranging in age from 9-10. While this fact should (and does) demonstrate that science doesn t know skin color, it also brought out the ugliness that s become pervasive in Trump s America.The winning team was from Pleasant Run Elementary in Indianapolis. As they were leaving the competition, though, things got really ugly. Some children screamed  Go back to Mexico,  to the team. Then, parents got involved and it got even worse.This verbal attack had spilled over from the gymnasium. While the children were competing, one or two parents disparaged the Pleasant Run kids with racist comments   and loud enough for the Pleasant Run families to hear. They were pointing at us and saying that  Oh my God, they are champions of the city all because they are Mexican. They are Mexican, and they are ruining our country,    Diocelina Herrera, the mother of PantherBot Angel Herrera-Sanchez, heard a woman say.Source: USA TodaySchool officials, naturally, apologized and said that that sort of behavior isn t tolerated, but unfortunately, this is Trump s America and enabling that sort of behavior is what the non-political correctness crowd is all about.Trump s America is why Rep.

Racism has suddenly become socially acceptable, at least among certain people. Trump has filled his cabinet and administration with white supremacists. Steve Bannon is a known white supremacist and he is the de facto Chief of Staff (sorry Reince Priebus, but you know this to be true). Their policies even want to make it easier (and slightly more legal) to be a radical right-wing extremist.The winning kids, fortunately, were much more mature than some of the adults. One gave the most heart breaking comment of all: They yelled out rude comments, and I think that they can talk all they want because at the end we re still going to Worlds,  said team leader Elijah Goodwin, 10.  It s not going to affect us at all. I m not surprised because I m used to this kind of behavior.He shouldn t have to be used to it.

 Trump’s Meeting With Germany’s Angela Merkel Goes From Awkward To Offensive In Seconds (VIDEO),"A sit-down meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel went from painfully awkward to downright offensive when Trump couldn t even muster an ounce of humility and grace. During a photo op, the two world leaders sat in stony silence as photographers did their best to try to capture a picture that showed some warmth between what are supposed to be two close allies. Instead they got Trump looking like his dad just told him they wouldn t be getting ice cream after all and Merkel squirming in discomfort.Trump s obvious irritability was bizarre to begin with, but his refusal to interact with Merkel only got worse. When a reporter suggested the pair give a handshake (as is customary when two leaders meet for the first time), Merkel leaned over to Trump to ask if he wanted to give it a go only to have Trump continue to stare straight ahead, ignoring her. She stared in astonishment, then resignation. The realization that the President of the United States really is this pathetic was written all over her face.Photographers: Can we get a handshake?

His healthcare plan is going down in flames. His budget cuts   which focus primarily on stripping funding away from the elderly and children in favor of more military spending   are getting some of the worst press since his Muslim ban. His second Muslim ban was just shot down by two federal judges. And his plan to accuse the British government of helping Obama wiretap him didn t just blow up in his face, but actually caused an international scandal. Or it could be the fact that Germany has shown zero interest in indulging his tantrums.Whatever the cause, America just got another clear reminder that the damage Trump is doing isn t just domestic. He s undermining relationships with crucial allies in ways that may take decades to repair. And he s not even willing to give a simple handshake to prevent it.Featured image via Twitter",News,17-Mar-17
 Incredible Photo Of North Korean Soldier Secretly Photographing Trump’s Secretary Of State,"While Trump s Secretary of State was visiting a UN base on the border of North and South Korea on Friday, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp. was photographed by a Reuters photographer, while at the same time, a North Korean soldier is seen photographing the top Diplomat covertly from the outside of a window. You can t make this stuff up. And now the picture is circulating on social media.In the image, a North Korean soldier can be seen on the right-hand corner of the picture peering in through a window and photographing Tillerson and a US Army general, Business Insider reports.The photo was taken inside the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which was created after the Korean War on what is now the most heavily armed border in the world, and obviously the most spied upon.NBC reporter Brad Jaffy tweeted out a version of the photo, which he zoomed in on, calling it  Rear Window. Rear Window: North Korean soldier takes a photo of Rex Tillerson at the DMZ pic.twitter.com/EHCIR3Fjo6  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 17, 2017The original photo can be seen here.Tillerson announced on Friday at a news conference in Seoul that military action against North Korea is  an option  if the threat from its nuclear weapons program rises to a level  that we believe requires action. Tillerson told reporters that  all of the options are on the table. According to the Korea Herald, Tillerson cut his recent visit short with South Korean officials due to  fatigue. The newspaper reported that Tillerson did not have lunch or dinner with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn during his visit there.Tillerson spent several hours meeting with Japanese officials, which included dinner meetings, the paper noted, according to The Hill.The secretary of State reportedly did hold talks with both South Korean officials regarding the threat posed by North Korea s nuclear program.And that must have been before  fatigue  set in. On Twitter, Trump said that North Korea was  behaving very badly. South Korea s Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye in March over a corruption scandal. In contrast, the U.S. has failed to address its newly minted president s growing list of scandals. Tillerson, too, has his own scandal to deal with.As for the North Korean soldier spying on Tillerson, perhaps if he wore spy glasses and a fake mustache no one would have noticed.

 Painfully Stupid Trump Fan Thanks God And ‘Trumpcare’ For Her Lower Healthcare Costs Under Obamacare,"A Tennessee Trump supporter is ecstatic that Obamacare has dramatically lowered her family s insurance costs, but she doesn t credit the Affordable Care Act for her family s good fortune   she says God and Trump are responsible.Charla McComic says that her son recently lost his job and, thanks to Trumpcare, his premium dropped from $567 per month to $88   a  blessing from God  and a gift from her fuhrer Donald Trump, she says. I think it was just because of the tax credit.  The Washington Post notes that the price change  was actually thanks to a subsidy made possible by former president Barack Obama s Affordable Care Act, which is still in place, not by the tax credits proposed by Republicans as part of the health-care bill still being considered by Congress. Sure, the ACA was passed before Trump even considered running for President and his own health care law   one that would strip coverage from millions of low-income families who need coverage the most   and, of course, her son s. We said:  Who else would we do this for, besides Trump?  McComic, who campaigned for Trump during the 2016 election, says, apparently because she is one of the  poorly educated  The Donald loves so much.  We agreed on the Lord. We would stand here for the Lord, but that s about it. So far, everything s been positive, from what I can tell,  she said while waiting for the first elected leader since Adolf Hitler to still hold rallies to begin speaking on Wednesday night.  I just hope that more and more people and children get covered under this new health-care plan. Contrary to McComic s beliefs, Trump himself knows and freely admits that his supporters will be hurt the most by his plan. Counties that voted for you, middle class and working class counties, would do far less well under this bill,  Fox News host Tucker Carlson recently told Trump. Yeah. Oh, I know that. It s very preliminary,  Trump replied.Sorry, Ms. McComic: Trump doesn t care about you, and the President you hated is responsible for your family s good fortune.Featured image via Facebook",News,17-Mar-17
 ‘Prepare To Kill’: Conservative Trump Fan Declares Open Season On Anyone Who Punches Nazis (VIDEO),"If you have not yet heard, another Nazi got  punched.  Noted racist and anti-Semitic conservative radio host Michael Savage was leaving a San Fransisco Bay area restaurant on Tuesday night when a man approached him and began making fun of his strangely appropriate legal last name,  Weiner. It is unclear what happened next   the  attacker  says that Savage shoved him first while Savage says the opposite, but in the end, the pro-Trump radio host ended up on the ground. Savage says that another man attempted to intervene, but was punched in the face by the unnamed  attacker.  According to Savage s story, he was able to get up while being  attacked  and help the man who had just gotten punched while simultaneously calling the police and his lawyer (quite a feat while he is the victim of a vicious attack, huh?).Both men, neither of whom were hurt in the scuffle, stayed at the scene to give statements to police. Savage s lawyer says that he is investigating if a  hate crime  was committed because Savage s hateful views may have contributed to the attack.But if you listen to conservatives tell the story, Savage was viciously beaten by a hateful and violent liberal (the  attacker s  political affiliation is unknown) who refuses to tolerate right-wing viewpoints like that people in Chicago are  ghetto slime,  that non-white nations are  Turd-World  countries, that Jewish people are  hook-nosed,  and other views regularly espoused by the terrible people who support Donald Trump.One rabid Trump supporter, James Stachowiak   you may remember him as the guy who made headlines when he said that black protesters (especially women and children) should be shot  in the backs  and that Hillary Clinton s place is in front of a  firing squad    says that Savage was  beaten and bloodied  in this  attack.  His solution, of course, is a bloodbath. Well people, I have the solution if you re approached by a group of people like they did to Mike Savage,  Stachowiak says in the video he filmed while driving. He then fumbles around in his pants for a moment and pulls out a gun   once again, while driving.  And here s my solution. It s time to start capping these bastards,  Stachowiak says.  Lethal force, people. Lethal force. Prepare to kill in defense of your free speech and the way you believe. Every one of the people who attacked Mike Savage needs to be hunted down and taken out vigilante-style,  Stachowiak says.  That s right, I m condoning the killing of the people who attacked Mike Savage. While violence is never the answer, let s put this in context: a single person allegedly shoved Mr. Savage, so Stachowiak thinks the solution is to round up a posse and murder him (the single individual that Mr. Stachowiak says was a gang of violent liberals).This is the mindset of the common Trump supporter: shoot first, whether it s warranted or not, because no liberal life is more valuable than whatever passes for dignity to these folks.

 Sean Hannity Is A Deranged Maniac Who Pulled A Gun On A Coworker,"Sean Hannity might be one of the most disliked people in television or radio  news.  Yes, news is in quotes because whatever Hannity does, it certainly doesn t resemble anything that Walter Cronkite or Edward R. Murrow would recognize as news, but I digress.Hannity has been called  Fox News  dumbest anchor,  which is a very low bar (we re talking to you, Steve Doocy). Besides being dumb, Hannity is a Trump sycophant and his go to  journalist  for softball interviews. He s also a gun-toting maniac who once pulled a gun on his coworker, Juan Williams.Still, Hannity s version of entertainment can go too far. Last year, after ending one of his many spirited on-air arguments with liberal contributor Juan Williams, Hannity pulled out a gun and pointed it directly at Williams, according to three sources with knowledge of the incident. He even turned on the laser sight, causing a red dot to bob around on Williams  body. (Hannity was just showing off, the sources said, but the unforeseen off-camera antic clearly disturbed Williams and others on set.)For the record: Hannity s colleagues brought the Williams incident to the attention of Fox News executives, though it s not clear whether anything came of it. The sources said it went to Bill Shine, the network s co-president and longtime Fox News executive, who is Hannity s longtime friend and a former producer. A Fox News spokesperson said the incident was referred to the legal and human resources departments.Source: CNNThis happened in October of last year and according to Fox News, Hannity was being totes safe because he s trained in gun safety. Hannity said he was trying to teach Williams a lesson, sort of. While discussing the issue of firearms, I showed my good friend Juan Williams my unloaded firearm in a professional and safe manner for educational purposes only,  Hannity s statement read.  Every precautionary procedure that I have been trained in since the age of 11 was followed. I ve had a conceal carry permit in five states for all of my adult life. Any other interpretation of this is outright false reporting. Williams, who still works for the network, tweeted that everything is cool, cause you know, a white guy pointing a gun at a black guy is what goes for normal in Foxland. And, well, what do you expect from a network that treats its women employees like sex toys? It s all about boys just being boys, don tcha know?(1/2) This incident is being sensationalized   everything was under total control throughout and I never felt like I was put in harm s way.

 White Supremacist GOP Congressman Says Colleagues Are ‘Patting Him On The Back’ For Racist Tweets,"The Republican Party is constantly pushing back against accusations of being a racist institution, despite the fact that they endorse and celebrate racists in their ranks.

Well, now, King himself has given us the answer as to why the condemnation didn t come from elected GOP officials as it should: Because, privately, they agree with him. King said: My colleagues have generally been coming by and patting me on the back. And a surprising number have said that they pray for me. And, meaning they support me and they agree with me, a surprising number. I don t often have members come up and say at the end of the day,  I prayed for you this morning.  So they must think I ve got a lot of arrows in my back. The only Republicans who condemned King s offensive remarks were those who are the children of immigrants themselves. Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R   Florida) tweeted at King:.@SteveKingIA What exactly do you mean? Do I qualify as ""somebody else's baby?"" #concernedGOPcolleague  Carlos Curbelo (@carloslcurbelo) March 13, 2017Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Florida) also voiced her anger at King via Twitter:Get a clue, @SteveKingIA. Diversity is our strength. All looking alike is such a waste. A travesty. I wanna be me. All others are taken. https://t.co/mx7vgeWPU8  Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (@RosLehtinen) March 13, 2017Both of the aforementioned lawmakers are Cuban-American. When asked if he had spoken to any of his colleagues about the comments, King apparently lied, saying: They have not approached me. But I would say of my Republican critics, you should take a look on their position on immigration and see where they stand. There seems to be a curious coincidence. When Rep. Curbelo heard what King has said, the remarks were greeted with an eyeroll, and he said: I saw him down at conference, and I said,  Hey, I just want to know if I m somebody else s baby.  He said,  You should have called me.  I said,  I don t have your number.  So he sent me his number and we agreed we d talk whenever we both time to sit down and talk about it. Hopefully, they can work it out, but something tells me there s absolutely nothing that will curb Steve Kings open white supremacy. Unfortunately, it seems that the bulk of the GOP agrees. Then again, we already knew that.Featured image via Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call",News,17-Mar-17
 Federal Judge Blows Lid Off Trump’s Biggest Complaints About Obamacare,"One of the arguments against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is that people are losing options as insurance companies are pulling out. That s true. Insurance companies are pulling out, but Republicans tell us it s because the law isn t viable and that insurance companies are leaving because they aren t making money. Well, a ruling from a federal judge just blew the lid off of that theory.The ruling, from Judge John D. Bates, a George W. Bush appointee, was in a case involving Aetna, who has pulled out of all but four of the states where they were part of the exchange. The claim was that they were losing money on the deal. Judge Bates found that that was a lie.Now a federal judge has ruled that that was a rank falsehood. In fact, says Judge John D. Bates, Aetna made its decision at least partially in response to a federal antitrust lawsuit blocking its proposed $34-billion merger with Humana. Aetna threatened federal officials with the pullout before the lawsuit was filed, and followed through on its threat once it was filed. Bates made the observations in the course of a ruling he issued Monday blocking the merger.Source: LA TimesThat pretty much eliminates one major talking point in the debate surrounding health insurance.The judge s conclusions about Aetna s real reasons for pulling out of Obamacare   as opposed to the rationalization the company made in public   are crucial for the debate over the fate of the Affordable Care Act. That s because the company s withdrawal has been exploited by Republicans to justify repealing the act. Just last week, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) cited Aetna s action on the  Charlie Rose  show, saying that it proved how shaky the exchanges were.In fact, the judge ruled, Aetna was profitable in some of the states but pulled out nonetheless just to make a point   a point that risked the lives or at least the health coverage of upwards of 20 million people. Bates believes that Aetna will start selling insurance in at least some of these markets again, so there goes the whole  Obamacare is imploding  idea.Clearly, not all insurers are lying to Americans. Kaiser Permanente loves the law. They ve even profited from it. The fact is that if they can do it, there s no reason other companies can t. All they have to do is cut back on the greed.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,16-Mar-17
 WHOA: It Appears Trump Leaked Classified CIA Info To Fox News," I just want people to know, the CIA was hacked, and a lot of things taken   that was during the Obama years. That was not during us,  Trump recently told Fox News propagandist Tucker Carlson during an interview.  That was during the Obama situation. Mike Pompeo is there now doing a fantastic job. In saying those words, it appears that The Donald did something against which he has been railing ever since his administration began leaking more than two Russian prostitutes in a certain orange man s Moscow hotel room: he leaked classified information.Now as President, Donald Trump can declassify any information he wants, but Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California points out that Trump did not make a purposeful decision  to do that. He just talked. In his effort to once again blame Obama, the President appeared to have discussed something that, if true and accurate, would otherwise be considered classified information,  Schiff said in a press release. The president has the power to declassify whatever he wants, but this should be done as the product of thoughtful consideration and with intense input form any agency affected. For anyone else to do what the President may have done, would constitute what he deplores as  leaks,  Schiff says. He also took to Twitter to rail against Mr. Number 45 for applying a different set of rules to himself than others:.@POTUS appears to have discussed something that, if true & accurate, would be classified. Had it been anyone else he would call it a ""leak"" pic.twitter.com/XedWH4CTNF  Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) March 16, 2017Interestingly, Trump doesn t consider little things like his administration s ties to Russia to be matters of public interest. Or his tax returns. Or anything else that could expose him for exactly what he is.But if Trump is in the business of declassifying information, he could easily answer any questions Americans have about Russia with a stroke of his pen.Do it, Donald.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,16-Mar-17
 New York Times Columnist Calls Trump A ‘Monster’ For Cutting Heating Assistance In Heartless Budget,"Donald Trump apparently hopes poor people starve or freeze to death.In order to make way for a massive increase to our already bloated defense spending, Trump plans to gut just about any domestic program that benefits Americans, especially low-income Americans.While Trump s family lives in a gold-plated tower and can eat anything money can buy, he apparently is just fine with letting the rest of us live in squalor with little to eat and no heat for warmth.You see, Trump s budget includes massive cuts to Meals On Wheels, which provides millions of hungry senior citizens with healthy meals and a courtesy well-being check.But that well-being check will likely end up becoming a nightmare if Trump is able to eliminate heating assistance programs.Millions of Americans are too poor to heat their own homes, so the next time a Meals On Wheels volunteer tries to serve your grandma or grandpa a nice meal, you could end up getting a phone call informing you about how your beloved grandparents froze to death because they didn t get their heating assistance one particularly cold month next winter.Trump s budget would literally make life a living hell for poor Americans who are already struggling to take care of themselves and their families. Trump supporters are especially going to feel the sting because they are the working poor in red states who rely the most on government aid.This budget is so bad that New York Times columnist Charles Blow referred to Trump as a  damned MONSTER  for proposing it.What kind of damned MONSTER proposes a budget like this?!!! Eliminating low income heating assistance?!!! So folks freeze? #trumpbudget pic.twitter.com/dBzSFjsRpn  Charles M. Blow (@CharlesMBlow) March 16, 2017Trump s budget is absolutely heartless and goes against the values that this country holds so dear. The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little,  Franklin D. Roosevelt once said.And Trump s budget guarantees that our progress fails miserably. But Roosevelt also warned that a hungry nation is ripe for a dictatorship, and Trump is definitely a wannabe dictator who is trying to starve the people. True individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence,  Roosevelt said.  People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made. Trump is not only waging a war against the poor, he is waging a war against democracy and the Constitution.Featured image via Jim Lo Scalzo   Pool/Getty Image",News,16-Mar-17
 Top Trump Advisor Exposed As Member Of Nazi Group – AND He Violated Immigration Laws: Report,"Funny how this just keeps happening.Yet another Trump advisor has been caught having ties to a shady, fascist-linked group in Europe. No it wasn t Trump s former campaign manager who had ties to pro-Russian Ukrainian separatists. Or his former National Security Advisor who was secretly working on behalf of the Turkey during Trump s campaign. Or his former advisor who has ties to both Russia and the hacker responsible for stealing the DNC s emails.This time it is Sebastian Gorka, a top national security advisor who was just outed as being a member of a Nazi-allied Hungarian group. Oh, and he also violated immigration laws when he moved to the United States and didn t mention that he was, in fact, a friend of Nazis. (Being a friend of Nazis is sort of something the American government frowns upon   at least it was until January 20th of this year.)Gorka was first outed by The Forward and things quickly came tumbling down.The elite order, known as the Vit zi Rend, was established as a loyalist group by Admiral Miklos Horthy, who ruled Hungary as a staunch nationalist from 1920 to October 1944. A self-confessed anti-Semite, Horthy imposed restrictive Jewish laws prior to World War II and collaborated with Hitler during the conflict. His cooperation with the Nazi regime included the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Jews into Nazi hands.Gorka s membership in the organization   if these Vit zi Rend leaders are correct, and if Gorka did not disclose this when he entered the United States as an immigrant   could have implications for his immigration status. The State Department s Foreign Affairs Manual specifies that members of the Vit zi Rend  are presumed to be inadmissible  to the country under the Immigration and Nationality Act.First he  stonewalled  when asked about his ties to the Nazi-allied group. Then the leaders of Vit zi Rend verified that he was a member of their organization which included taking what they call a  lifelong oath of loyalty to their group.  And finally Gorka refused to confirm or deny that he was a member of the group. As many have noted, being asked  Are you a member of a pro-Nazi group?  shouldn t be hard to answer. For most people it would be easy to say  no  or more colorfully  Are you crazy? Of course not! Gorka instead told reporters to  send a request to White House press.  Sean Spicer is about to have a really bad day.The stonewalling by Gorka comes at a time when the Trump administration is already having trouble condemning anti-Semitism. Trump s pathetic lack of moral fiber when it comes to intolerance coupled with the revelation that one of his closest advisors is a member of a group that handed  hundreds of thousands of Jews into Nazi hands  prompted the Anne Frank Center to   once again   condemn the Trump administration.Steven Goldstein, executive director of the @AnneFrankCenter gave this statement: pic.twitter.com/Xczmq0uX0k  Talal Ansari (@TalalNAnsari) March 16, 2017At what point do all these dots finally become connected?

 Watch Trump Flat-Out Admit Trumpcare Will Ruin The Lives Of His Own Supporters (VIDEO),"The Republican bill meant to dismantle the Affordable Care Act has been hit on all sides as nonsensical, dysfunctional and sinister. The plan, which appears to be scrapped together with little thought to the consequences, has been shown by the Congressional Budget Office as well as many outside reviewers an excellent way to cost tens of millions of people their health insurance while also not saving very much money for anyone but the wealthy.And critics of the bill now have a perfect soundbite  from President Trump himself.In an astonishing interview with Fox s Tucker Carlson, Trump casually admits that the plan put forth by Paul Ryan and endorsed by his administration will make millions lose insurance. Even more incredible, Trump acknowledges that the deepest harm will be felt in poor, red states   states that overwhelming voted for him. Only a man who inherited millions, never worked a day in his life, and lives in a literal gold tower could be so nonchalant about essentially admitting that his plan will destroy access to healthcare to the American public:Carlson, who to his credit presses Trump on how damaging this healthcare replacement bill is, points out that the  centerpiece  of the bill is a tax cut the ultra-rich. On the flipside, the bill disproportionately harms poor people. A Bloomberg analysis showed that counties that voted for you   middle class and working class counties   would do far less well under this bill. Trump s response:  Oh, I know that. I know. Yikes.Trump later tried to salvage the admission by saying that while this bill clearly screws over his own voters, there will be other   so far nonexistent   additions that will magically help those affected. He never bothers to explain how exactly this would happen. No proposal has even been suggested that addresses these issues. Like a chef admitting he poisoned the food but who still expects his customers to eat up because he may have some Pepto-Bismol lying around somewhere. Only the food poisoning will kill you.And the chef is a known liar.And the Pepto-Bismol is more tax cuts for the rich.Featured image via Fox News",News,16-Mar-17
" CNN Panel ERUPTS, Gets UGLY After Guest Defends Trump’s Muslim Ban (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s disgusting travel ban is a highly divisive issue, and last night it caused a CNN panel to completely devolve into chaos as the panelists went at each other s throats on national television.On CNN Tonight, host Don Lemon had his hands full as he tried to maintain some sort of order and control over his panel guests as they discussed Trump s second version of his travel ban, which bans travelers from 6 majority-Muslim countries. But when former federal prosecutor John Flannery accused Harvard Law School s Alan Dershowitz of supporting the controversial ban due to his apparent pro-Israel views, things got heated rather quickly. Flannery said: Our dear colleague, Alan Dershowitz, I think, hopes that this may secure Israel. I think it s a powerful argument that we ve established religion in this fashion through this ban that is transparently against Muslims. Dershowitz flipped out at this accusation, and fired back: You re lying through your teeth. I never said a word about Israel. When you focus on everything I say about Israel it really raises questions about your own bigotry and biases, so let s get to the point and just keep your mouth shut. Dershowitz then stated that although he felt the ban was  bad policy , Trump was within his constitutional boundaries to order it. He and Flannery sparred over the legalities for a bit, before the conversation circled back around to Israel. Dershowitz then exploded: What does this have to do with Israel? Why in your bigoted background do you have to bring in Israel to attack me? Your bigotry is showing. Flannery responded, I believe that s the reason you re taking the position you are    and this set Dershowitz off. You can t believe anything I say because I m a Jew and a Zionist? For shame on you sir. I never want to be on the show with this bigot again! Lemon then had to step in and try to restore some sort of civil discussion. Without a doubt, Trump s travel ban is one of the worst things he s done in his short disastrous two months as POTUS, and it s raising some very important questions amongst Americans and their biases.

 WATCH: Paul Ryan CONFIRMS That Trump’s Wiretapping Accusation Is A Complete Lie,"House Speaker Paul Ryan just dropped the hammer on Donald Trump and his outrageous accusation against President Obama.Just over ten days ago, Trump took to Twitter to openly accuse President Obama of wiretapping him.Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my  wires tapped  in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Of course, Trump provided absolutely no evidence to support his claims and still has not done so, even after Congress set a deadline for Trump s administration to provide them with it.Well, Trump missed the deadline and Congress extended it, but the writing is already on the wall. Trump lied when he claimed that Obama wiretapped him, and Republicans are admitting it.On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes said there is no evidence to back up Trump s claim. We don t have any evidence that that took place and in fact, I don t believe   just in the last week of time, the people we ve talked to   I don t think there was an actual tap of Trump Tower,  Nunes said.Rep. Adam Schiff concurred, saying,  I ve seen no evidence that supports the claim that Trump made that his predecessor had wiretapped he and his associates at Trump Tower. Thus far, we have seen no basis for that whatsoever. And Paul Ryan buried Trump s claim once and for all during a talk with the press on Thursday. The intelligence committees   in their continuing, ongoing, and widening investigation into all things Russia   got to the bottom, at least so far with respect to our intelligence community, that no such wiretap existed.

 Trump Decides That Starvation Should Be A Central Theme Of His Budget,"Programs that have kept hungry Americans fed for decades are being slashed so Donald Trump can spend more money on the bloated military budget.Since 1954, the United States has funded Meals On Wheels, a program that supports 5,000 community-based senior nutrition organizations across the nation. Over 2.4 million hungry Americans 60 years of age and older directly benefit from the program.And getting a meal in their bellies is not the only benefit Meals On Wheels provides.According to a research study, the Meals On Wheels program:Improved mental health, specifically decreases in depression and anxietyImproved physical healthReduced likelihood of fallsReduced feelings of isolation and lonelinessLess worry about being able to remain living at homeIncreased feelings of safetyA higher likelihood of eating healthyBasically, Meals On Wheels volunteers serve as a check on the health and well-being of vulnerable senior citizens. They ve literally saved lives.But if Trump has his way, millions of seniors are going to starve and lose all of the other benefits associated with Meals On Wheels.Trump is planning to gut the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program, which includes Meals On Wheels as part of his heartless plan to increase defense spending. As we should all know, the United States spends more on defense than anyone else in the world and could cut spending in half and still be number one.That defense spending includes $3 billion a year for Israel. So while senior citizens are starving in America, Israel will continue ripping off American taxpayers in their bid to commit genocide against Muslims.Trump is also taking aim at the Food for Peace Program, which is  a State Department program that distributes food assistance in emergencies such as famine and natural disaster, and does some non-emergency food relief. This particular program plays a critical role in American diplomacy because our humanitarian efforts help build American prestige and respect throughout the world.By eliminating these programs, Trump is clearly sending a message to everyone inside and outside our borders that he does not care whether you starve to death or not.And that includes people who voted for Trump, since Trump won the vote of those 65 an older eight points in 2016. Looks like Trump voters are getting screwed again.Meals On Wheels is already struggling as it is to provide meals for the 2.4 million people they currently serve. But as Meal On Wheels explains, the senior citizen population is exploding and hunger is going to get worse.The reality is, more than 10 million seniors in America struggle with hunger, 15.2 million live in isolation and 18.4 million live in or near poverty. And, this problem will only become more serious as the senior population is projected to double by 2050. Families are spread out and elders are left behind, often as they struggle to remain able to take care of themselves.That means Trump is only making hunger in America worse by cutting this program. He should be ashamed of himself, and Republicans should be ashamed as well. Because they can t seriously call themselves  Christians  and not support programs that feed the hungry.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,16-Mar-17
 Palm Beach County Looks To Levy Tax On Mar-a-Lago To Pay For Cost Of Trump’s Expensive Visits,"Donald Trump has been vacationing at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida nearly every weekend since taking office, and now Palm Beach County intends to force him him to pay for it.The cost of Trump s weekend forays have been devastating for local taxpayers and area businesses.For two months now, they have had to deal with providing extra security, directing traffic, shutting down a local airport, and all the economic hazards Trump has caused.Of course, Trump doesn t care about the people he hurts as long as he gets to throw parties and golf on the taxpayer s dime.So far, Palm Beach County has had to pony up $1.7 million for extra security when Trump is in town.And because of the extra security, businesses in Palm Beach are losing tens of thousands of dollars every weekend, causing many to literally go broke.In fact, Trump s weekend vacations has cost taxpayers on the national level over $10 million and counting and Trump is on pace to play more golf and go on more vacations and spend more money on those vacations in a single year than President Obama did during his whole eight years in office.Palm Beach county residents and officials are especially tired of Trump s visits, and they want their back, which Trump has so far refused to reimburse.So Palm Beach lawmakers are looking to classify Mar-a-Lago as a  municipal service benefit unit  so they can level a special tax on Trump to force the money out of him.County Commissioner Dave Kerner is looking into this method to provide relief to local taxpayers who have had to deal with the burden. It s one thing for a president to visit once in awhile, but every weekend is ridiculous.According to the Palm Beach Post,It could give the county a way to impose a special tax on Trump to reimburse the county for the millions it has shelled out for roadway management and security assistance during the president s frequent trips here.The tax would not be a property tax, Kerner said. Instead, it would be a tax pegged to the value of any  special benefit  the county has provided to Mar-a-Lago s owner   Trump.In other words, if Trump wants to continue taking his little trips to Florida, he ll have to pay the price. And that will at least give the residents of Palm Beach something to smile about when Trump comes to town.Featured Image: Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,16-Mar-17

 Trump’s HHS Secretary Argues That Insurers SHOULD Be Able To Charge Sick People More (VIDEO),"The debate about health care has lead to some pretty ugly comments from the right, but without a doubt, this one is among the most disgusting. Donald Trump s Health and Human Services secretary, Tom Price, recently argued that insurance companies should be allowed to charge sick and elderly people more.According to Price, if we don t let insurance companies charge older, sicker people so much money for coverage that they can t afford it at all and just let them die, then we will find ourselves with any insurance companies period. Well, the fact of the matter is that if we re gonna have any insurers, and the ones that are remaining are saying,  if you con t change this, if you don t stabilize this market, if you don t make it so that we can actually price to the risk of an individual, then we re not gonna be able to stay here at all.' And his answer to this dilemma? To go ahead and allow insurance companies to price sick people completely out of insurance coverage altogether. Now, this may sound like a stupid question, but it s one I have to ask nonetheless. WTF is the point of having insurance at all if you are gonna end up without it when you need it the most? Isn t having insurance to help with the sky-high costs of medical care when you re sick kind of the whole point?Not to mention that this literally means he would rather let people die because they can t afford to see doctors, treatments, and medications so that the insurance companies can save a dollar? It s absolutely disgusting and infuriating. Healthcare is a human right, not just a luxury for the rich.You can watch Trump s health and human services secretary condone allowing insurance companies to price sick people out of health care here:Tom Price: insurers should be able to charge sick people more for coverage.

 Trump FURIOUS After Federal Judge Stops His Bigoted Muslim Ban In Its Tracks (VIDEO),"Just hours before Donald Trump s new Muslim ban was set to go into effect, a federal judge in Hawaii blocked the executive order. U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson ruled on Wednesday afternoon that the travel ban still doesn t still doesn t pass legal muster. The illogic of the Government s contentions is palpable. The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed,  Watson wrote. Equally flawed is the notion that the Executive Order cannot be found to have targeted Islam because it applies to all individuals in the six referenced countries,  Watson added.  It is undisputed, using the primary source upon which the Government itself relies, that these six countries have overwhelmingly Muslim populations that range from 90.7% to 99.8%. It would therefore be no paradigmatic leap to conclude that targeting these countries likewise targets Islam,  Watson added.  Certainly, it would be inappropriate to conclude, as the Government does, that it does not. Trump then proceeded to fly into a rage during a campaign rally in Nashville, Tennessee. (Yes, this man is seriously still holding campaign rallies. But I digress.) While speaking, Trump said the ruling was  terrible  and promised to take the case all the way to the Supreme Court if he had to. We re going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court,  Trump said. We re going to win. The danger is clear. The law is clear. The need for my executive order is clear. Obviously fuming over the decision, Trump insisted that Judge Watson ruled against his Muslim ban for  political reasons.  After all, it simply couldn t be because it s based on bigotry. Trump said that this  makes us look weak  when it comes to fighting terrorism.According to Trump, his latest attempt to ban Muslims from the country was tailored to the dictates of the flawed ruling  on his first ban. This is a watered-down version of the first one,  Trump said.  And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to to in the first place. Trump also whined that he couldn t say the things he really wanted to say about the judge s decision to halt his bigoted ban because he would be  criticized. I have to be nice otherwise I ll be criticized for speaking poorly about our courts,  he told the crowd.  Among the most dishonest people in the world, I will be criticized.

 Rand Paul’s Solution For Healthcare Is Only Half Horrible (VIDEO),"Rand Paul is a self-described libertarian, but his idea for how to fix our healthcare system sounds awfully socialist. On the right, Paul has been one of the biggest critics of Trumpcare, calling it  Obamacare lite. What we think is being hidden from conservatives is there s a lot of  Obamacare Lite  in their bill,  the Kentucky Republican said on CNN s  New Day  Friday.  There s a new entitlement program.   There is also a Cadillac tax or something similar to the Cadillac tax that was in Obamacare. And there s also an individual mandate, believe it or not. Instead of paying the mandate to the government, they re going to tell you you have to pay the mandate, by law, to an insurance company. Paul, speaking at a Freedom Works rally, had his own proposal, which might as well have been an advertisement for the National Rifle Association. His suggestion is that people should be able to buy health insurance through the NRA.Here s the video: You see what he did there?The truth is, this isn t the worst idea in the world. The NRA is a sizable membership organization, but it s far from the biggest. The fact is, large groups people have a lot more clout than individuals. AAA has 40 million members, as compared to the NRA s 4.5. The AARP would probably be happy to negotiate with insurance companies and sell policies to their members.Inadvertently, though, the rabidly anti-union (but pro-gun) Republican, made the case for unions. Individuals don t have much if any negotiating power with insurance companies, or really, anyone. Still, Republicans want to leave individuals on their own, with the imagined idea that somehow, shopping is equivalent to negotiating. It s not. If you have the option to buy from six overpriced plans, you re still paying too much, but hey, you got a choice.The third largest membership organization in the world is a union. Unfortunately, you have to work for them to get the benefits of their negotiations, but if more people had access to unions, prices would drop across the board.But, there is one major problem with Paul s idea. Most employers, including most union employers, pick up at least part of the monthly tab. That s where the government subsidies that Republicans hate would come in. If an organization like AAA or even the NRA were to offer health insurance, it would still cost a lot more money than a decent employer plan, at least without some government help.Sorry, Republicans, but unions aren t synonymous with corruption anymore than the corporations that supply the paychecks, but they do give workers a voice, and in the case of goods and services, they give workers negotiating power. All free market Republicans should be behind more negotiating power, but the truth is, Republicans only want the market to be free for large corporations. All the rest of us should be at their mercy.Still, even at half bad, it s better than Trumpcare.Featured image via video screen capture",News,15-Mar-17
" Judge Uses Trump’s OWN WORDS To Prove ‘Travel Ban’ Is About Banning Muslims, Slaps Down Order","In the second time in less than two months, Trump s attempt to ban Muslims from entering the United States has been slapped down by a federal judge.The state of Hawaii officially blocked Trump s refashioned executive order that he had hoped would allow him to ban Muslims from certain Middle Eastern countries. The court case was closed just six hours before the ban was scheduled to begin.The temporary restraining order, which applies nationwide, blocks the Trump administration from enforcing sections 2 and 6 of the new executive order   the travel and refugee portions of the order.It will now be up to Trump to decide whether he wants to appeal or give up. The last time he was faced with this reality check, Trump promptly freaked out, promising to  SEE YOU IN COURT    only to later drop plans to appeal. Instead, he had gambled everything on this rewrite. And he just lost again.SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017In an incredible twist, US District Judge Derrick Watson used Trump s very own words as part of his reasoning for slapping down the executive order.Judge then QUOTES TRUMP regarding the ""religious animus driving the promulgation of the Executive Order."" pic.twitter.com/T0KCc06RMY  Jessica Huseman (@JessicaHuseman) March 15, 2017It s fitting that Trump s big mouth was his undoing. For years now he has publicly held the position that if elected he would  ban Muslims  from coming to the United States. Now that he is actually in office, his argument was that his executive order had nothing to do with religion. The countries he picked just happened to be Muslim-majority. The people he detained in airports just happened to be Muslims. The exemptions he said would be allowed just happened to be non-Muslims. Judge Watson wasn t buying any of it.Calling Trump s comments  significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus driving the promulgation of the Executive Order.  Put another way: This order is bigoted to its core   as was the previous one.Watson concluded: Any reasonable, objective observer would conclude, as does the Court for purposes of the instant Motion for TRO, that the stated secular purpose of the Executive Order is, at the very least,  secondary to a religious objective  of temporarily suspending the entry of Muslims. This judge has Trump pegged.Featured image via Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images",News,15-Mar-17
 Darren Wilson Just Admitted He LIED About Michael Brown Trying To Take His Gun,"If you ask any conservative, Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson was completely justified in shooting Michael Brown under extremely suspicious circumstances because the unarmed African-American teenager tried to Grab Wilson s gun.  This, Wilson now admits, is a lie.In his 2014 testimony, Wilson claimed that Brown grabbed his gun and said  you are too much of a pussy to shoot me. The gun goes down into my hip and at that point I thought I was getting shot,  Wilson said   and the Right ate it up.This self-defense claim also allowed the officer to escape without any criminal charges, and was very popular among conservatives, who wanted nothing more than to exonerate their beloved white police officer. But Wilson s answer now is very, very different. In a questionnaire related to a civil trial, he now admits it didn t happen.Wilson now says that not only was the holster designed to prevent the very scenario that he says made him scared enough to shoot the unarmed teen, but that Brown did not try to remove the gun from his holster at all (though he does still maintain that Brown was a living, breathing weapon of mass destruction):Wilson also admits that he used the word  n*gger* to refer to African-Americans, and that he heard other Ferguson cops do the same:At this point, if it is not clear to you that there was a severe miscarriage of justice in not locking this monster up, there is no help for you.Featured image via screengrab",News,15-Mar-17
" Florida Is About To Make Murder Legal – Yes, Really","Soon, if you live in Florida, it will become very difficult to prosecute for murder.Florida s loose murder laws became national headlines with the death of Trayvon Martin, in which a 17-year-old African-American boy was caught in the act of walking at night. George Zimmerman, who was nothing more than a self-appointed neighborhood watch officer, killed Zimmerman in 2012. After more than a year of right-wing media thoroughly trashing the victim, Zimmerman was found not guilty of murder. A Zimmerman of today would find it even easier, assuming the bill passes.If the measure becomes law, the state would again be at the forefront of expanding self-defense laws. Florida would become the first state to apply a tougher standard to the law during the pretrial hearing. Under the measure, the burden of proof would be shifted to prosecutors and defendants would no longer have to present evidence, typically by taking the stand, to prove their claim of self-defense.Instead, prosecutors would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt   the highest legal standard   that the use of force was not justified. Prosecutors have fiercely opposed the measure, saying it runs counter to the traditional workings of the criminal justice system. Typically, when defendants seek the dismissal of charges at a hearing   arguing entrapment, for example   it is up to them to present evidence and persuade the court, not the other way around.The new standard would require prosecutors to essentially put on a nonjury mini-trial, requiring victims and witnesses to testify twice and delaying the actual trial, prosecutors said. And with defendants no longer required to offer evidence   which usually means taking the stand   there will be little, if any downside, for them to claim a Stand Your Ground defense.Source: New York TimesCurrent Stand Your Ground laws make already make it easy to get away with murder, if you re white. In states with Stand Your Ground laws, there has been an eight percent increase in murder and in non-negligent manslaughter. In other words, more people are dying and more people are getting away with it.Getting away with murder isn t for everyone, though. According to studies,  whites who kill blacks in Stand Your Ground states are far more likely to be found justified in their killings. In non-Stand Your Ground states, whites are 250 percent more likely to be found justified in killing a black person than a white person who kills another white person; in Stand Your Ground states, that number jumps to 354 percent. This proposed Florida law would only make things worse. When the burden of proof lies entirely with the dead guy in murder cases, it s difficult enough to prove, but when you add to the fact that the victim is black, well, you know how things will turn out. As they say, dead men tell no tales. To far too many, though, a dead black man has the presumption of guilt.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,15-Mar-17
 VINDICATION: Sally Yates Nominated For JFK Courage Award For Standing Up To Trump’s Muslim Ban,"The former acting attorney general who became an instant symbol of heroic defiance of Trump when she was fired for refusing to support the administration s unconstitutional Muslim ban has been nominated for a Profile in Courage Award, known as the highest honor given to public servants.The award is named awarded in honor of John F Kennedy and  recognizes a public official (or officials) at the federal, state or local level whose actions demonstrate the qualities of politically courageous leadership in the spirit of Profiles in Courage, President Kennedy s 1957 Pulitzer prize-winning book, which recounts the stories of eight U.S. Senators who risked their careers by embracing unpopular positions for the greater good. It seems like Yates  refusal to enforce an executive order that was not only unconstitutional but unethical as well fits that bill. She was nominated by Democratic politician Jackie Speier who offered this message on Twitter:Just told w/ Sally Yates I've nominated her 4 President Kennedy s Profile in Courage Award 4 standing 4 the public good #ThankYouSallyYates  Jackie Speier (@RepSpeier) January 31, 2017At a time when many politicians are showing a marked lack of courage, Yates stands out from the crowd. In just one egregious example of gutlessness, recently an audio recording taken of Paul Ryan during the presidential campaign proved that he not only despised Trump but viewed him as fundamentally unfit for office. Now that Trump got elected, nobody has been more subservient and docile than Ryan. The lack of backbone is embarrassing to watch, but Ryan is hardly alone. Republicans are nearly unanimous in supporting Trump despite privately admitting they think he is a lunatic. If there were a  Profile in Cowardice  award, this year would have some stiff competition.Despite her popularity among the American public, Yates  decision to stand against Trump couldn t have been an easy one. She was publicly fired from her job as acting Attorney General, only to find that Trump wasn t finished. In characteristic shamelessness, he sicced his attack dogs on her who quickly went to places like Fox News and Breitbart to smear her.Yates  experience is a reminder that opposing Trump, particularly from within the government, is not going to be easy. He will use every tool at his disposal to discredit and attack his critics. Which is why being recognized for the courage it takes to do so is vitally important. It may send a message to other would-be defectors that America is behind them. And Trump s administration will start to unravel at the seams.Featured image via Pete Marovich/Getty Images",News,15-Mar-17
 Conservatives Are Now Threatening The Family Of The Journalist Who Released Trump’s Taxes (TWEETS),"It was obvious this was going to happen, but if you were holding out hope that David Cay Johnston could release Donald Trump s tax returns without facing harassment from his supporters, you will be sad to know that Trump fans are just as horrible as ever. Ever since he broke the story, Johnston says that cowardly Trump supporters have been threatening his wife and one of his children.

 Meet The Woman Who Took Down Evangelical Pedophile Josh Duggar,"By now, everyone is aware of what took down the Duggar family, of TLC s 19 Kids and Counting fame. It was the explosive revelations that one of the most famous members of the reality television family, Josh, was a pedophile. He had molested his own sisters, as well as other girls in the house. It led to the cancelling of the show, and to the family leaving public life in disgrace. However, no one ever knew who was responsible for it   but now we do.A woman by the name of Sherri Townsend is the one who tipped off InTouch Magazine to the true and sick nature of what was going on in the Duggar clan. They weren t just some weird family who were part of a right-wing religious cult and exploiting their insane beliefs for piles of cash. No   they were a family of child abusers, and Townsend set out to prove it. Prove it she did, and there was the end of the Duggars  reality show goldmine and public promotion of their sick religious cult.Townsend says, via Facebook, of what she did: I m going confess/admit to y all something that I did a couple of years ago that not very many people know was me.I told a reporter from InTouch magazine about Josh Duggar s molestation/pedophilia of his sisters and others, which broke the story and ultimately caused his resignation as the head of the Family Research Council and got his family s hypocrisy-filled show cancelled. Townsend goes on to say that it was a special on so-called  conversion therapy  pushed by anti-LGBTQ religious nuts like the Duggars that got her to reveal who she is: Sitting here sick to my stomach from watching last night s 20/20 expose on conversion therapy camps, I can see that hateful religious bigotry is still alive and well and that the dangerous hate group, the Family Research Council, has doubled down on promoting their brand of bigotry causing terrible harm to countless people. THEY NEED TO BE BROUGHT DOWN. That group is true evil!!! Bringing them down will now be added to my list of causes!!! Good on Sherri Townsend. At the height of his fame, Josh Duggar was working for the anti-gay hate group the Family Research Council, and he and his family were the ultimate right-wing paragons of hate and so-called Christianity. Now, they are pariahs and a national disgrace, as they always should have been.Sherri Townsend, you are one brave woman. Thank you for exposing this hypocrisy, abuse of children, and religious cultism for what it is, and taking these despicable people down.Featured image via Twitter",News,15-Mar-17
 Joe Scarborough Just EVISCERATED Trump’s Attorney On Twitter Over Tax Returns (TWEETS),"The days when Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough would play nice with Donald Trump are definitely over. Not only has Scarborough turned into a major Trump critic, but he s actually going after Trump s team now.While Trump s team scrambles to do damage control after Trump s 2005 tax return was released last night on Rachel Maddow s show, Trump s personal attorney Michael Cohen decided to individually attack anyone who criticized Trump and claim that he d intentionally leaked his tax returns to journalist David Cay Johnston himself. What Cohen didn t bank on was getting into a vicious Twitter war with Scarborough, and getting his a** handed to him in the process!Earlier this morning, Scarborough had weighed in on Trump s tax document, adding to the suggestions that Trump was behind the leak. Scarborough noted that this tax return was suspiciously normal, and wondered why it hadn t been a more current tax document:Cohen saw this and decided to jump in, attacking Scarborough and saying that he  better have proof  to back up his  big mouth    proving that everyone on Trump s team is a bully.Cohen immediately regretted this, because Scarborough hit right back and put it perfectly when he told him to  save your dumb thug routine for someone who gives a damn.  Brutal. Cohen has now resorted to retweeting insults people are making about Scarborough on Twitter, obviously because he s not courageous enough to come up with something himself. Meanwhile, Scarborough is attacking Trump on everything from his tax returns to his wiretapping accusations against former President Barack Obama   which Trump still has yet to provide any evidence for.Once again, the media has shown more guts and spine than anyone on Trump s team, and anyone in the Republican Party for that matter.Featured image via Frederick M.

 CNN Host STUNS Sean Spicer With An ONSLAUGHT Of Facts About Obamacare Repeal (VIDEO),"CNN s Jim Acosta has been a thorn in the Trump administration s side ever since Donald Trump insulted him during a press conference and called him and the news network  fake news . Needless to say, every time Acosta asks a question, Trump s team gets nervous   and this was apparent yesterday when White House Press Secretary found himself cornered by Acosta on the GOP s new healthcare plan at a White House briefing.When Acosta brought up the fact that the Republicans  new plan would result in millions of Americans losing their insurance   a fact that was confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office   Spicer almost blew up trying to defend the GOP s plan. Acosta asked: Would you concede that there will be some coverage losses, perhaps in the millions? There will be millions of people who will not have health insurance because of what you re doing. Spicer tried to argue against Obamacare s individual mandate, stating that many Americans already chose not to purchase Obamacare, instead opting to pay penalties   but Acosta wasn t having any of it. Acosta replied: The mandate forces people to buy insurance so you don t have the free rider problem. You have free riders and those folks end up in car accidents and end up at the emergency room. And then health care is much more expensive. Spicer tried to hit back and say that Obamacare  forced people to buy plans that they did not like that were mandated by the government,  but Acosta continued to lay into him with fact after fact. Acosta was quick to point out that the CBO stated that over 20 million fewer Americans would have coverage by 2020, and argued that government-run health care like Obamacare was not the problem. Acosta said: Medicare is government-run health care. I don t see citizens screaming that they want you to get rid of their Medicare. Acosta and Spicer went back and forth over the GOP s new healthcare plan for several minutes, and it was clear that Spicer was unraveling and about to lose it.

 Ruby Rose And Chrissy Teigan Troll Donald Trump’s Wiretapping Nonsense In Hilarious Twitter Spoof,"The longer Donald Trump and his merry band of authoritarian misfits carry on with the baseless claims that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 election cycle, the more subject they are to merciless and unrelenting ridicule. The latest people to troll Trump? Entertainers Chrissy Teigan and Ruby Rose.The two women had been on Lip Sync Battle together, and they used that as a way to riff on Trump s insane allegations against the former president. Taking to Trump s favorite platform for communication, Twitter, Teigan and Rose engaged in a back and forth in which they pointed Trump s own insanity back at him:The best part is that Ruby Rose pretty much outright calls Trump crazy. That s because he is. As funny as this is though, and as well-deserved as the mockery here and elsewhere is, it is also frightening. Donald Trump is president of the United States. What he says   even via Twitter   is of the utmost importance. He lies incessantly   pathologically, even, and seems at times to be downright delusional. That is dangerous for the nation and the world, to have such a person holding the nuclear codes.Keep the mockery up, celebs. Perhaps Trump will go so far off the rails that the men in white coats will come for him, and we ll all be saved.Featured image via Michael Buckner/Getty Images (Teigan)/Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images (Ruby Rose)",News,15-Mar-17
" House Intelligence Committee: Trump Lied About Obama, Absolutely Zero Evidence Of Wiretapping (VIDEO)","Less than 24 hours after Trump s press secretary Sean Spicer said the president was  extremely confident  that his accusations against Obama for wiretapping Trump Tower would be proven correct, the House Intelligence Committee scheduled a press conference to say they found zero evidence that this happened. Absolutely zero.House Intel Chair Devin Nunes has been a strong Trump supporter and has repeatedly flirted with launching a full-fledged investigation into Trump s claims that Obama spied on him. Instead, after a week of complete nonsense, Nunes said he and his committee are confident there was not  an actual tap of Trump Tower.  This directly contradicts Trump s unfounded accusation:How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Despite repeated calls to provide evidence, Trump has not done so. Nunes said in light of the lack of evidence, he isn t buying it.GOP House Intel Chair on Trump's claim:  We don t have any evidence that took place   I don t think there was an actual tap of Trump Tower  pic.twitter.com/Ojco3ZFJ1f  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 15, 2017Trump has failed to provide any details about the allegations he made against Obama. According to a timeline of events and also staffers within the White House, Trump got his information   which would implicate Obama in a major felony   from a story run on white nationalist website Breitbart, which, in turn, had lifted the conspiracy theory almost verbatim from a conservative radio host named Mark Levin. Neither Breitbart nor Levin bothered to offer any proof for these allegations. (In fairness, neither probably expected that their Obama hit job pieces would find their way into the president s early morning tweetstorms and their regular readers, eager to hate Obama, don t typically require evidence for their outrageous claims.)So it s painfully obvious that Trump is a unrepentant liar, but being a Republican hack meant Nunes couldn t let it go at that. He had to try to paint Obama as sinister in other ways. Rather than admit his president is a liar who made these allegations without a shred of proof, Nunes expanded his definition of  spying  to include the  incidental collection of Americans that were possibly tied to Trump s campaign.  He hoped this would mean Americans would see that as an intrusion of Trump s privacy.Which is extremely weird because that only goes to show the uncomfortable relationships between Trump and the Russians during the campaign. The very fact that their were  incidental collections  of information on Trump s staffers was because those staffers (think Michael Flynn) were communicating with Russian operatives who were under surveillance. This would be like having a chat with an ISIS leader then being mad that the CIA listened in.Ironically, that makes Trump and his goons look much worse than either Obama or the CIA.So how does Nunes sleep at night knowing he s supporting a president who is   at best   a pathological liar? He said he s not sure Trump was being  literal  when he accused Obama of the worst political crime since Watergate:House Intel Chair Devin Nunes:  Are you going to take the tweets literally?

 WHOA: Trump State Campaign Chair BUSTED Shacking Up In Hotel Room With Underage Boy,"Donald Trump s Oklahoma campaign chair is a standup guy   except when he s laying down with children, that is.  On Tuesday, The Oklahoman reported that state Senator Ralph Shortey was busted last Thursday getting a hotel room with an underage teen boy. On March 9   officers of the Moore Police Department were contacted in reference to a welfare check at a local hotel,  Lt. Kyle Dudley told the publication.  Responding officers found a juvenile male in a hotel room which was also occupied by an adult male. The circumstances surrounding this incident are currently under investigation and no additional information can be released at this time. Police thus far refuse to release a full report on the incident.Shortey (who is best-known for a bill that would ban the use of aborted fetuses in food) registered himself and his underage  guest  as adults at a Super 8 in Moore for a single night, checking in on March 8 and out on March 9. It says two adults registered,  the motel manager says   at 12:20 a.m. Responding to a welfare check call, police arrived while the the two were still in the room and took pictures according to an employee at the hotel.No charges have been filed yet, but police are investigating text messages sent between the boy and Shortey, who announced in 2015 that he was  proud to be tapped  to chair Trump s 2016 campaign in Oklahoma.This is something that must be embarrassing for Shortey, who recently bragged that he had lunch with Donald Trump Jr.:What was Shortey doing with an underage boy in a hotel room after midnight? There s no way to know for certain yet. But let s hope the child was not harmed.Featured image via Facebook",News,15-Mar-17

 Trump’s Border Wall Sh*t Just Got Real – Texans Receive Notices To Sell Or Have Their Land Taken,"Texas landowners along the U.S.-Mexico border have begun receiving notices from the federal government saying that they re coming to either buy, or take, parcels of land for Trump s pointless border wall. According to the Texas Observer, landowners are receiving  Declarations of Taking  notices that offer a price for the piece that the government wants. If the landowners refuse that, then they may see those parts of their property taken via eminent domain.One landowner, Yvette Salinas, got her notice back in January. She d been dreading it for a while because of George W. Bush s focus on a border fence. Under Obama, she d been able to relax a bit because he focused on patrolling and monitoring the border in ways that didn t include taking land and building a wall.Now, with Trump in office, this shit has just gotten real. Whether any of these preparations happened while Obama was still in office or not, it s Trump who is pushing the wall forward as quickly as he can. It s one of his focal points, and it will be his government that buys up or takes the land.The introduction in Salinas  letter reads like this: The United States of America is acquiring property along its border with Mexico in order to construct a fence and related improvements designed to secure the border, as required by the Secure Fence Act of 2006. They offered Salinas and her family $2,900 for 1.2 acres of land   the same amount for the same land that the government offered her under George W. Bush years earlier. The tiny community in which she lives Los Ebanos lies entirely within the floodplain of the Rio Grande. That land is protected by a treaty with Mexico that forbids the building of structures that could force floodwaters into other communities, and has been an obstacle towards border wall construction.Under Trump, though, Los Ebanos seems to have become a focal point. The government has already completed surveys and planning for a wall there. Despite increasing problems with costs, the fact that crossings are down, and the fact that Republicans are voicing their discomfort with the idea, Trump keeps hammering the wall as the way to secure the border.It s impossibly stupid. People who live along the border prefer the technological surveillance and the presence of the U.S. Border Patrol to a wall because they believe that s more effective and costs a hell of a lot less. And they don t have to give up pieces of land that have been in their families for generations for that.They also know people will still cross whether there s a wall or not.Salinas doesn t want to sell that bit of land but she doesn t know what to do. The community doesn t want to allow the wall to be built through there, either, but neither can they afford to have the U.S. government sue them, and they risk having their land taken without compensation if they try to fight.Featured image by Erik S.

 Former Virginia Mayor Could Get 40 Years After Pleading Guilty To Trading Meth For Sex (VIDEO),"The former mayor of Fairfax City in Virginia is facing up to 40 years in prison after he pled guilty to trading crystal meth for sex. Richard  Scott  Silverthorne entered a guilty plea to one charge of distributing methamphetamine on Monday.This shocking story began in August of 2016 when Silverthorne was arrested. Police say they got a tip that he was using a website to set up casual sexual encounters and distribute meth. An undercover officer set up a fake profile on the site and Silverthorne took the bait. In just days he had responded to the undercover officer and arranged to meet him at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in McLean, Virginia. The police set up a sting operation and busted him when he gave the undercover cop two grams of meth. During the raid, police arrested Silverthorne and two other men.Silverthorne was released on his own recognizance last August and had remained free since then. It was expected that he would be released today to await his sentencing hearing, but instead, he was sent to jail. Reports say that there were  audible gasps  in the courtroom when the judge made the announcement.His sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 9. He could receive a maximum of 40 years behind bars and a hefty $500,000 fine. However, his attorney, Brian Drummond, says he is hopeful that Silverthorne will get time served and be placed on probation because of the decades he has spent as a public servant with no criminal record.Before he was caught trading drugs for sex, Silverthorne had been re-elected as Fairfax City Mayor. He was also a substitute teacher who worked in the Fairfax County Public Schools. After he was arrested, a special election was held in February of 2017 to replace him.You can watch more on this story here, via ABC7: Featured image via video screen capture",News,14-Mar-17
 Trump Already Going Ballistic Over Maddow Getting His Tax Returns – Releases Unhinged Statement,"Trump has long claimed that he was legally not allowed to release his tax returns because of an alleged  audit  that required him to keep them a secret.

So much for the audit lie.The statement, like many of Trump s reactionary tantrums, was light on culpability and focused mostly on whining about how unfair it was that his taxes would be released this way.You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago.Ironically, the question of whether the current president is in violation of the law   specifically conflict of interest laws   is exactly why Rachel Maddow and other investigative journalists are looking into Trump s taxes in the first place. And because he is the first president in decades to flatly refuse to release them,  leaking  the documents to the public is the only way they ll come to light.WH responds to MSNBC report on Trump tax returns: ""you know you are desperate when you willing to violate the law "" pic.twitter.com/DCedFdxWCc  Jim Acosta (@Acosta) March 15, 2017Trump s statement   which appears to have been hastily written, in part, by Trump himself   claims he paid around $38 million in taxes while pulling in around $150 million in income. The document, as summarized by the Daily Beast, goes into more detail:The documents show Trump and his wife Melania paying $5.3 million in regular federal income tax a rate of less than 4% However, the Trumps paid an additional $31 million in the so-called  alternative minimum tax,  or AMT. Trump has previously called for the elimination of this tax.So in Trump s ideal world, he would like billionaires like himself to pay a 4% tax while using loopholes and tax havens to avoid paying the lion s share of what he owes. That s pretty pathetic coming from a person who has been using his time in office to dismantle welfare programs and cut spending in the arts and sciences.There is an alternative theory about the tax returns: Trump  leaked  them himself, all so he could freak out about it later.Johnston: possible POTUS leaked returns   ""Donald has a long history of leaking material about himself when he thinks it's in his interest.""  Betsy Klein (@betsy_klein) March 15, 2017What would his  interest  be: One could argue that this might be the very best tax return he has. As reporters get closer to his more recent filings, he may have leaked this document to placate journalists, be seen throwing a tantrum, and hope that everyone moved on. If that s the case, reporters should be encouraged to dig even harder. They have clearly struck a nerve.Featured image via Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images",News,14-Mar-17
 Comey GOING PUBLIC With Russia/Trump Investigation After Pressure From Congress,"FBI Director James Comey could very likely be the reason we have a President Trump. Just shy of two weeks prior to the 2016 election, Comey sent a letter to Congress that essentially said that his investigation into then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s private email server could potentially be re-opened. Despite his open condemnation of Hillary s activities, Comey kept mum on the investigations   the much more SERIOUS inquires   on the other side, which would be those into the possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign into the election s eventual outcome.Well, all of that is now coming to a head. Trump s team has been repeatedly caught being linked to Russia and lying about it. His national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign for his lies to Mike Pence about his Russia ties, and has since registered with the United States government as a foreign agent. It has also been found that the newly confirmed Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, has been forced to recuse himself from any Russia-Trump investigations due to his lying to Senator Al Franken during his confirmation hearings regarding his own conversations with the Ambassador to Russia.Now, it seems that there is a firm way to bring this to an end. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) seem to have had a meeting with FBI Director Comey on March 2. According to Whitehouse, during that meeting, Comey promised him and his GOP counterpart that they would have the answer we ve all been waiting for by this coming Wednesday   which is whether or not the Federal Bureau of Investigation is actively probing the activities of the Trump campaign with regards to Russia and the 2016 election.Whitehouse says that not only will Comey tell them whether or not he and his agency are investigating Trump s Russia ties, but he will also go into  the scope of their Russia/Trump investigation because he had not been able to at that point say that there was one. Well, this should definitely be interesting. After all, Comey was more than willing to throw the election to Trump by screwing Hillary Clinton with nonsense that amounted to nothing, while Vladimir Putin installed a Russian agent and his cronies as head of the United States government. Hopefully, once Comey is under oath, whatever is revealed will take Trump down once and for all.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,14-Mar-17
 The CBO Caught Trump In Another YUUUGE Lie; Entire Premise For Repealing Obamacare Out The Window,"Other than the wall and maybe the Muslim ban, the signature issue for Donald Trump the presidential candidate was repealing and replacing Obamacare, which he sold to his voters under the guise that it was about to implode   this year, as a matter of fact.We are making great progress with healthcare. ObamaCare is imploding and will only get worse. Republicans coming together to get job done!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 11, 2017But while the Congressional Budget Office was scoring Trumpcare, and declared it a complete disaster which would result in tens of millions of people losing their health insurance, they completely put to bed the idea that Obamacare is about to implode.The paragraph isn t the easiest thing to read, especially if you have Donald Trump level reading skills, but here it is:Under current law, most subsidized enrollees purchasing health insurance coverage in the nongroup market are largely insulated from increases in premiums because their out-of-pocket payments for premiums are based on a percentage of their income; the government pays the difference. The subsidies to purchase coverage combined with the penalties paid by uninsured people stemming from the individual mandate are anticipated to cause sufficient demand for insurance by people with low health care expenditures for the market to be stable.Vox translated it this way:Translating from wonk-ese, the subsidies offered to lower-income people under ACA are scaled both to income and to the local price of health insurance. Which means that for heavily subsidized customers, the higher premiums don t drive people out of the marketplace. And there are enough young and healthy people who qualify for generous subsidies to ensure a stable long-term risk pool.Despite the report, Trump is still going along with the idea that Obamacare is set to implode. On Fox News on Monday, he said,  It s a disaster if we let it go for another year, it ll totally implode. Here s that video:.@POTUS on #ObamaCare:  It s a disaster.   If we let it go for another year, it ll totally implode.  pic.twitter.com/V0EmWafqHD  Fox News (@FoxNews) March 13, 2017Really, that s not the least clever strategy in the world. If you tell people they are going to lose their healthcare anyway, they might be more amenable to eating the shit sandwich the GOP is trying to feed them in place of healthcare. We can t let the nation fall for it. Obamacare is not about to implode. We have time to make it better.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,14-Mar-17
 Sean Spicer Finally Admits Obama Probably Didn’t Spy On Trump Through ‘Microwaves’ (VIDEO),"According to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway s completely serious suggestion that President Obama used  microwaves  to spy on Donald Trump was simply a remark made  in jest. Ever since Trump s prized idiot first claimed that Obama used microwave ovens to keep tabs on The Donald, experts have weighed in, pointing out that you d have to be the biggest moron in the universe to believe for even a second that it is a  fact of modern life  (as Conway says) that a microwave is useful for spying on someone. During his Tuesday press briefing, a reporter with a  what-the-fuck-am-I-even-saying-is-this-really-what-my-life-has-become?  look on her face asked Spicer if Donald Trump  believes he was surveilled through microwaves and televisions. I will just say the president has tweeted about this,  Spicer replied.  He s pretty clear that he believes there was surveillance that was conducted during the 2016 election. and we re going to wait for the conclusion of that. I think there is pretty sound evidence that the microwave is not a sound way of surveilling someone, and I think that has been cleaned up. It was made in jest. So I think we can put that to rest. Sorry, Spicy. Conway and the Trump administration will never live down the ridiculous assertion that Barack Obama spied on Trump through the microwave   especially as long as you choose to cling to the equally ridiculous notion that our last legitimate President tapped the  wires  at Trump Tower to spy on the campaign.Watch Spicer try to put the whole microwave thing to rest below:",News,14-Mar-17
" Trump Just Had The Most AWKWARD Moment With Saudi Crown Prince, HUMILIATES Himself (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s relationship with the press is problematic, to say the least   and he only has himself to thank for that. Thanks to his abrasive, immature nature and his nonstop lies and  alternative facts , Trump has made the political news environment extremely tense, prompting the press to push back every time he goes off the rails or puts the American people at risk. And to people in other countries, this is absolutely baffling.Earlier today, Trump met with Saudi Arabian Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and pretty much ruined the meeting by trying to impress the prince. Desperate for approval and a good first impression, Trump decided to make a sarcastic remark and throw the press under the bus, and he humiliated himself when it failed to have the desired effect.In the Oval Office, Trump and the prince sat down for a photo op with reporters and photographers. In the footage, Trump is seen looking nasty and pissed off for the cameras, visibly irritated by something. Finally, he breaks his scowl, turns to the prince and points to members of the press corps and sarcastically remarks: Very nice people. Trump probably thought he was so cool and clever, until his  joke  feel flat. The prince didn t get Trump s weird, awkward sense of humor and instead of joining in on the insult like Trump probably hoped he would, the prince let out an uneasy laugh, tilted his head and said: We hope so. The prince didn t know it, but it was the perfect response to shut down Trump s bullying of the media. And apparently, people are loving every second of this on Twitter: Trump embarrassing himself in front of other world leaders has now become the norm, and America s reputation continues to deteriorate every time he fails to act presidential. We could hope that this awkward moment with the prince might teach him a lesson, but that s just wishful thinking at this point.Featured image via Sean Rayford / Getty Images",News,14-Mar-17
 Oxford Fellow GLORIOUSLY Buries Trump For Trying To Discredit CBO Report On Trumpcare,"Donald Trump just got owned.On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office graded the GOP healthcare bill that they dubiously named the  American Healthcare Act. And the results were not good at all.Despite Trump calling the bill  wonderful  and claiming that everybody in America will have health insurance coverage, the CBO pointed out that the bill would cause 24 million Americans to lose their healthcare and would make the price of healthcare skyrocket.Of course, Trump administration officials immediately attacked the CBO report. We disagree strenuously with the report that was put out,  Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said.  It s just not believable, is what we would suggest,  Price continued, insisting that the GOP healthcare plan will cover more people and make healthcare more affordable.Trump s Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney also dismissed the report and attacked the CBO. This is exactly what we thought the CBO would come forth with,  he said.  They re terrible at counting coverage. The CBO report is full of errors   not errors, they re just bad assumptions like that. It s the only way you can get to these bizarre numbers. The reaction from Trump s administration was predictable, and Oxford Fellow Brian Klaas brilliantly prepared for it by pointing out at least 13 instances where Trump used CBO reports to attack President Obama.Trump s team will try to discredit the CBO assessment of its health care bill this week.Here are 13x he used CBO estimates to attack Obama pic.twitter.com/bAEyxubnXv  Brian Klaas (@brianklaas) March 13, 2017You know, because Trump is a hypocrite.And Trump can t say that the CBO is wrong just because it gave him a report he doesn t like.As it turns out, Trump s Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and his Republican colleagues in Congress picked the official who currently runs the Congressional Budget Office.The CBO is *the* trusted expert; it is led by a Republican. Price helped pick the director. And Trump used CBO stats 13x to attack Obama. https://t.co/QMdy3fLEfq  Brian Klaas (@brianklaas) March 13, 2017Here s Trump s Health Secretary praising the selection of the *Republican* HE HELPED PICK to run the CBO.

But they don t like the facts so they are attacking the CBO despite the fact that they picked the guy who runs it. Apparently, they expected him to be biased and run it dishonestly.Featured image via screenshot",News,14-Mar-17
 Trump Claims That Optimism In America Is ‘Great’ Because He’s Making Wealthy CEOs Happy,"Donald Trump keeps pretending that everyone is so happy and optimistic since he took office. Twitter users were quick to blow apart his delusional alternate reality.In yet another post on his favorite social media platform, Trump declared that there is  great optimism in America  in response to a Bloomberg report that CEOs are more optimistic now than they have been in years.Great optimism in America   and the results will be even better! https://t.co/SYBl47CsZn  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 14, 2017Of course, that s all because Trump is gutting regulations that protect workers and the environment and has promised to slash corporate taxes to new lows.But while America s wealthy CEOs are smiling about how much wealthier they are about to become, such moves have not made Americans very optimistic at all.Because while Trump s decisions are making CEOs happy, they re not the ones who will suffer because of them.In response to Trump s declaration, Twitter users were quick to point out that the American people are not at all optimistic about what is happening in Trump s America.@robbystarbuck @realDonaldTrump @markets And bad for the healthcare of the most vulnerable Americans, but  yay job growth.  ?

We re also the ones who will have to suffer because of Trumpcare.

 Paul Ryan Exposed As SPINELESS As Leaked Audio Shows Him TRASHING Trump (VIDEO),"It s no secret that Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is spineless   that s a reputation he s earned for himself throughout his entire career. But thanks to an audio clip from October 2016 that has just resurfaced, everyone is now being reminded how unreliable and weak Ryan truly is when it comes to holding to his beliefs.Coming at a time when Ryan is receiving tons of negative criticism due to his celebration that the CBO report on the American Health Care Act is going to cost millions of Americans to lose their health insurance, this looks pretty bad for the House Speaker. The footage from October 2016 was posted by none other than Breitbart, and it shows Ryan distancing himself from Trump after the corrupt businessman s misogynistic comments on the infamous Access Hollywood footage. Ryan can be heard saying: I am not going to defend Donald Trump, not now, not in the future. I m not going to be campaigning with him for the next 30 days. I m doing what I think is best for you, the members, not what s best for me. I m going to focus my time on campaigning for House Republicans. Ryan then trashed Trump, suggesting that he was an awful nominee that pretty much had no chance. He stated the only way the GOP might survive would be to preserve a House majority: It s amazing how easily she could be beaten. We need a check on Hillary Clinton, if Donald Trump and Mike Pence don t win the presidency. You can listen to Ryan trash Trump below:In response to the leaked audio, Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck said: The world is well aware of this history. And obviously a lot has happened since then. Yes, a lot HAS happened since then   but Ryan is still spineless as ever and is now kissing Trump s ass. The GOP should be ashamed of him.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,14-Mar-17
" Trump Decides To Gut United Nations Funding By 50 Percent, Embarrassing And Endangering America On The World Stage","Donald Trump has decided to go through with his threat to defund the United Nations in retaliation for making a decision he didn t like.America has been the foremost leader on the international stage ever since World War II. After the war, the United States led the way in creating a more united and cooperative world by founding the United Nations to serve as a peacekeeping and humanitarian organization.The United Nations headquarters in located in New York and America has veto power and a seat on the prestigious United Nations Security Council.But now Donald Trump is preparing to slash funding to the United Nations by 50 percent, a move that would be a major blow against international cooperation and our reputation around the globe.Not only will the United Nations be cut by $5 billion, Trump s plan also makes a 37 percent cut to the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development budgets.And it s all in an effort by Trump to increase the already bloated military budget.United Nations expert Richard Gowan warned that cutting the funding would cause chaos and could cause agencies and programs within the United Nations to implode as other countries struggle to fill the gaps. Cutting the U.S. contribution would leave a gaping hole that other big donors would struggle to fill,  Gowan said.  Multiply that across other humanitarian agencies, like the World Food Program, and you are basically talking about the breakdown of the international humanitarian system as we know it. Indeed, the budget cuts could be devastating to the United Nations and threaten to bury international cooperation as we know it.Republicans have even drafted a bill directing Trump to withdraw the United States from the organization entirely.That means the United States would also be withdrawing from the World Bank, the International Court of Justice, the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the International Atomic Energy Agency, among many others.And because the United States is cutting funding, the United Nations may look to China or Russia to replace the funding, which could pave the way for a new power structure as the United States withdraws support.It s not only a serious blow to humanitarian efforts and global peacekeeping efforts, it s a serious rejection of international diplomacy and cooperation.And it s all because Trump and Republicans did not like that the United Nations passed a resolution condemning the continued building of Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory even though such resolutions have passed before.Trump is literally defunding the United Nations because they didn t comply with his demands despite the fact that President Obama was still in office at the time.This is absolutely humiliating for the United States and it should horrify the American people that Trump is withdrawing our country from the international community. Our influence and respect throughout the world will wane because of this decision and it will be difficult to regain it.America is once again becoming an isolationist nation, and the last time we ignored the world around us over 100 million people were killed in two world wars. By ignoring the world again and the growing humanitarian crisis, we are paving the way for World War III. And make no mistake, such a war today will make the first two world wars look like minor skirmishes.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,14-Mar-17
 Trump Tries Taking Credit For Jobs Created By Obama Economy And Gets BURIED For It,"Donald Trump is getting fantastically mocked right now for bragging about jobs that are being created as a result of President Obama s economic policies.As soon as the February jobs report was released, Trump and conservative media immediately jumped all over the report as proof that Trump is creating jobs in America as he promised to do during the campaign.The problem is that Trump once called these jobs reports  phony  when they were issued under President Obama, who oversaw a record 75 consecutive months of job creation in this country.But now that Trump is in office, he is touting the jobs reports as  real  and is taking credit for the job creation even though that job creation is directly tied to Obama s economic policies   Trump has not yet done anything at all with regard to the economy.Apparently, Trump watched Fox News on Tuesday morning and decided to brag on Twitter about the job creation.JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! pic.twitter.com/wAkQMKdPXA  Donald J.

However, Congress left the door open for Trump by setting a deadline for him to provide evidence supporting his accusation.White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer then tried to start backing away from the accusation, claiming Trump didn t mean  wiretapping  when he said it.And now that deadline to provide proof has come and gone, meaning Trump was clearly lying when he accused President Obama of a felony.Joe Scarborough reacted to the missed deadline on Twitter. This is a joke right?  he asked.  I m not being a smart ass here but everybody knows Trump was lying about Obama and the FBI tapping him. EVERYBODY. This is a joke right?

These reporters trying so hard to keep a straight face and Sean Spicer, who s a nice guy, but he s got to stop. He s got to stop,  Brzezinski said, noting that the Justice Department has nothing to give Congress to justify an investigation.And then she called Trump out. Were you lying, Mr. President? Did you make it up? Was it some little spurt of activity that you had out of need to have action? I d like to know where it came from because it s a very serious allegation. Here s the video via YouTube: Indeed, it is a very serious allegation. In fact, Trump has opened himself up to a defamation lawsuit, which President Obama should most certainly file. Trump should not be allowed to get away with making such accusations. There needs to be consequences.But Congress is apparently still trying to bail Trump out. Despite the missed deadline, Congress extended it to March 20th and if the Justice Department still has no proof it appears that Republicans are going to use their subpoena power to start a witch hunt against President Obama rather than do anything about Trump s Russia scandal.Joe Scarborough is right. This administration is a joke. And so are Republicans in Congress.Featured image via screenshot",News,14-Mar-17
 Texas GOPer Angrily Demands Voter ‘SHUT UP’ When He Complains About Violence Against Women (VIDEO),"At a town hall in Frost, Texas last week a voter expressed concerns about violence against women   but Rep. Joe Barton was not interested in hearing them.The constituent asked Barton to work with Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democrat, to sponsor legislation that could combat violence against women   a topic that has not much interested the Congressman in the past: Given your voting record opposing legislation protecting women from violence, will you make a commitment to us today, make a promise that you will reach out to Congresswoman Jackie Speier and work with her to see this bill successfully through Congress? Barton says he voted against the bill because he believes violence targeting women   which happens literally everywhere   is a  state issue, not a federal issue. His audience was not pleased. The crowd responded with a chrous of boos. Violence against women, that s a national issue!  one person yelled in response.  That s an issue that impacts everyone everywhere, not only in this country, but everywhere! But Barton wasn t done. Pointing his finger at the man who had the audacity to suggest that he take a moment to care about women, he demanded: You, sir, shut up. You don t tell anybody to shut up!  the man shouted back.

 BUSTED: The IRS Finally Just Yanked A Trump-Supporting Nazi Group’s Non-Profit Status,"It s time for the IRS to end non-profit status for all conservative organizations.But at least they did the right thing by taking away the non-profit status of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist organization run by obnoxious Trump Nazi Richard Spencer.For years, the Nazi organization got away with being classified as a non-profit. You know, because the IRS apparently doesn t vet these organizations to make sure they legitimately should get such status.That s why conservatives have created a ton of  non-profits  over the years. It s a Trump-like scam designed to fleece people of their money and not pay taxes on it.But Spencer s little scheme got busted for failing to file tax returns for more the three years starting after 2012.According to the Los Angeles Times,The IRS had apparently misclassified the National Policy Institute and publicly listed the group as not being required to file such forms. The IRS fixed the error in February, and on Monday it updated its records to say that the National Policy Institute s tax-exempt status had been stripped retroactively as of May 15, 2016, when the group s 2015 tax return would have been due.Of course, Spencer is trying to pin the blame on the IRS instead of taking personal responsibility.On Monday, Spencer said an IRS error led him to believe his group was not required to file federal tax returns, and said he would appeal the loss of his tax-exempt status. I don t know what to say. I don t want to make a comment because I don t understand this stuff,  Spencer said in a telephone interview.  It s a bit embarrassing, but it s not good. We ll figure it out. Tax experts, however, countered Spencer s bullshit by pointing out that ignorance of the tax code is not an acceptable excuse.They should have known that they should have been filing,  said Philip T. Hackney, a law professor at Louisiana State University who formerly worked for the IRS, specializing in nonprofits.  It s very clear under the law that if you don t file for three years, you lose your status. Chuck McLean, a senior research fellow at Guidestar, a site that monitors and publishes records of nonprofits, agreed.  Ignorance is no excuse,  McLean said.But the National Policy Institute should also lose non-profit status because the organization openly endorsed Donald Trump. Non-profits are barred by federal law from supporting political candidates.At one event held in November, Spencer received Nazi salutes after telling the crowd  Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory! If anything, Nazis should be punched in the United States, not given non-profit status so they can spread their evil agenda.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,14-Mar-17
 Seth McFarlane BRUTALLY Mocks Kellyanne Conway’s Ridiculous ‘Microwave’ Theory (TWEETS),"Family Guy creator Seth McFarlane just couldn t resist having a bit of fun with Kellyanne Conway s absolutely batsh*t insane claim regarding Trump s unfounded allegation that President Obama spied on The Donald through his microwave. On Monday, the legendary comedy figure tweeted his own theory about what Conway meant   and to him, it sounds a lot like the sort of thing you d expect from the furniture at PeeWee s Playhouse (those sneaky little bastards):So basically @KellyannePolls, you're saying this is how Obama spied on Trump: pic.twitter.com/8IeecMwa5E  Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) March 13, 2017 There was an article this week that talked about how you can surveil someone through their phones, through their certainly through their television sets, any number of different ways,  Conway said over the weekend as she attempted to defend Trump s claim that Obama tapped his  wires  at Trump Tower.  And microwaves that turn into cameras, et cetera. So we know that that is just a fact of modern life. Tech publication Wired explains that it is, contrary to her assertion, impossible to use a microwave oven to spy on someone (unless, of course, it really is the worst Transformer ever):First, let s take Conway s assertion literally. Microwaves (the waves) can be used for certain types of imaging, as in radar, but a microwave oven can t be used as a camera unless it literally has an outward-facing webcam onboard. No such microwave appears to exist. That s in contrast to the case of the spying Samsung TVs, referenced by Conway, that each come with a built-in, internet-connected microphone.But what if we were to take Conway not literally, but seriously? Asked whether a microwave could be turned into not a camera, specifically, but a listening device, Stephen Frasier, a microwave imaging and radar researcher at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, let out several seconds of sustained laughter. Unless it s a voice-activated microwave oven connected to the internet I can t think of a way,  says Frasier. Outside of a failed smart microwave Kickstarter, no microphone-equipped microwaves appear to exist. In fact, a quick check of major appliance manufacturers including GE, LG, and Samsung shows that internet-connected microwaves are a rarity. Even those that might exist in early-adopting kitchens would be far more likely to be conscripted into a botnet than used as a listening device.To date, the Trump administration has not produced a shred of evidence to back Trump s claim   though they did secure additional time to stall as they desperately search for something   anything   that will at least convince the most stupid among us that it happened.Featured image via Getty Images (Michael Tran)/screengrab",News,14-Mar-17
" White House Has No Evidence Of ‘Wiretap’ Lie, So They’re Trying To Walk It Back (DETAILS)","Last week, the alleged president made some jaw-dropping accusations on Twitter, accusing his predecessor of wiretapping his phones before the election. Trump did this without offering any proof. After Trump s tweetstorm, his team twisted itself into a pretzel in order to try to defend Trump s unprecedented attack on his predecessor. Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama literally rolled his eyes after hearing of Trump s baseless claims.Trump s fact-free conspiracy theory even garnered the attention of House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA) and Ranking Member Adam Schiff (D-CA), who gave him until Monday to produce evidence to back up his claim. It s worth noting that Nunes is a staunch defender of Trump s and even went as far as to try to cover up the amateur president s Russian influence scandal so he must find this indefensible.On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that Trump  doesn t really think  that Barack Obama  tapped his phone personally,  in an attempt to walk back Trump s wild and unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor ordered an illegal wiretap of Trump Tower, Politico reports. He doesn t really think that President Obama went up and tapped his phone personally,  Spicer told reporters at the press briefing.Spicer tried to use Alt-words to defend his boss.Spicer tried to argue that Trump had accused the Obama administration of general  surveillance  activities, and not a literal wiretap, even though Trump himself had use the term  wire tapping  in one of several tweets making the claim without evidence on March 4. Spicer claimed that the fact that Trump put quotation marks around the words  wire tapping  in one tweet was proof that he was not speaking literally. I think there is no question that the Obama administration, that there were actions about surveillance and other activities that occurred in the 2016 election. That is a widely-reported activity that occurred back then,  Spicer said.  The president used the word wiretap in quotes to mean broadly surveillance and other activities during that. Ah, so if Trump used quotes (he did so only one out of three times) then we are not to take him literally. Weird. It is interesting how many news outlets reported that this activity was taking place during the 2016 election cycle, and now we re wondering where the proof is,  Spicer added.  It is many of the same outlets in this room that talked about the activities that were going on back then. No one knows what Spicer is talking about:It is unclear what reports Spicer was referring to. News outlets have reported that intelligence officials have been investigating whether there were inappropriate ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. As part of the probe into the country s suspected attempts to meddle in the election and regular surveillance on Russia s ambassador, they have reportedly intercepted communications between some campaign aides and Russian officials.There is no proof or credible source which has reported that Obama wiretapped and/or surveilled Donald Trump during the campaign.As we said, Trump only used quotes in one of three tweets, not that that should matter. Is it legal for a sitting President to be  wire tapping  a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!  Trump wrote in one tweet. I d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!  another tweet read. How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  Trump wrote in a misspelled tweet.So now, Trump  s Department of Justice has asked the chairman and vice chairman of the House Intelligence Committee for  additional time  to collect evidence to support Trump s crazy-time claims. Meaning, Trump doesn t have proof. He just reads fake news sites such as Breitbart and Gateway Pundit then tweets the fake news.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,14-Mar-17
" With One Simple Chart, The Wall Street Journal Just WRECKED Trumpcare (IMAGE)","Republicans seem to be steadfast in their quest to destroy the Affordable Care Act despite all the facts showing that doing so will be devastating not only to the millions of Americans who rely on the law to have access to affordable coverage but also to the economy.The Congressional Budget Office has just come out and said that not only would 14 million lose coverage by next year under Trumpcare, but by 2021, 21 million will lose insurance, and then by 2026, 24 million.And yet, there are still Republicans and those who support them who insist on repealing Obamacare and replacing it with the subpar version known as Trumpcare. So, for the visual learners out there who can t quite seem to grasp how horrific this all is, the Wall Street Journal made a graph to show how drastic this loss of coverage will be.Here s the image:The projected percentage of uninsured Americans under the House GOP plan vs. Obamacare: https://t.co/zOSvG99BmU pic.twitter.com/cbv37xVQs4  Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) March 13, 2017While the new bill would seemingly reduce the deficit over time, it leaves behind tens of millions of Americans who will no longer have access to care.

 American Medical Association Says GOP’s Make America Sick Again Bill Is ‘Unacceptable’,"The Congressional Budget Office released their assessment of the GOP s Obamacare replacement bill on Monday and the news was worse than many had even feared. According to the analysis of the nonpartisan group, the American Health Care Act would result in 24 million people losing their healthcare within the next ten years.Talking Points Memo reports that in response to the CBO report, the American Medical Association denounced the Republicans  make America sick again bill as  unacceptable. If this bill were to become law, CBO projects 14 million Americans who have gained coverage in recent years could lose it in 2018. For the AMA, that outcome is unacceptable,  the group said on Monday.The AMA made their opposition to the AHCA crystal clear last week. In a letter written last Tuesday, the group said there was no way they could  support the AHCA as drafted   because of  the expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations. Critically, we urge you to do all that is possible to ensure that those who are currently covered do not become uninsured,  the AMA begged lawmakers.The CBO assessment estimated that of the 24 million people who would lose their insurance over the next decade, 14 million would find themselves without coverage before the end of the year. When the number of people already uninsured is combined with those who would lose their healthcare under the AHCA, a total of 52 million people would have no coverage by 2026. Today s estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office underscore the AMA s concerns about the AHCA as it is written,  the AMA said.The AMA conceded that the Affordable Care Act was admittedly  an imperfect law,  but they said there was no way to deny that Obamacare was  a significant improvement on the status quo at the time. The AMA believes we need continued progress to expand coverage for the uninsured. Unfortunately, the current proposal   as the CBO analysis shows   would result in the most vulnerable population losing their coverage. Under the AHCA, the elderly and disabled would be hit with higher premiums than their younger, healthier counterparts. This means that they would also be the most likely to be unable to afford coverage even though they are the ones whose lives depend on healthcare the most.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,13-Mar-17
" Trump Friend Alex Jones Just Challenged Alec Baldwin To A Fight, And It’s Gonna Be Hilarious (VIDEO)","Trump influencer, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, is downright  furious  with the  beta males  at Saturday Night Live for mocking Trump (and him) during the cold open last week. The segment took aim at Trump for getting what he calls  information  from Alex Jones and Jones himself for thinking that shapeshifting lizard people are an actual thing. But Jones is most furious with Alec Baldwin, because of course he is.On Monday, Jones (who thinks Sandy Hook was fake) railed against  anti-human scum  Baldwin for  defaming  him (and, of course, Trump) with a comedy routine. Naturally, his solution was to challenge Baldwin to a fight. Alec Baldwin thinks he is a tough guy,  Jones said on his show. I challenge him a million dollars to the charity he wants to get in the ring with me, bare knuckle. I will, I ll do it right now. I ll get in the ring with you and I will break your jaw, I will knock your teeth out, I will break your nose, and I will break your neck. You want to sit there and defame me and the president?  Jones added.  Get in the ring with me, I will break your jaw in seconds. I will smash your nose into a bloody pulp, and I will whack your teeth out. You frickin  bully, you coward,  the bully added.  I hate you, my listeners hate you and remember that, scumbag, forever. Heh heh heh heh. We re going to defeat this anti-human scum, we re going to wreck their world. Baldwin had not yet responded when Jones later had second thoughts about his chances in the ring with the actor, who has likely received at least some martial arts training during his extensive career. Jones said he was  just joking  when he challenged Baldwin to a fight, adding that he  meant that metaphorically. We are still awaiting Baldwin s reply, but we re sure it will be epic. We ll update this when he puts the right-wing conspiracy theorist in his place.Watch the clip below:Featured image via screengrab",News,13-Mar-17
 White House In Deep Denial Over Dumpster Fire Healthcare Plan (DETAILS),"The Congressional Budget Office released their analysis of the GOP s Obamacare replacement plan today, and their findings were bad. Really bad. According to the CBO s report, 14 million people are going to lose their healthcare by the end of the year and 24 million will be without coverage by 2026. But somehow, the White House is in complete denial about what a disastrous bill they are pushing.Health Secretary Tom Price said on Monday afternoon that the administration  strenuously  disagrees with the CBO s report. Despite the numbers presented to him, he still insists that more people will be covered and costs will be lowered under the Republican plan.White House says it disagrees  strenuously  with finding that 14M would lose health coverage under GOP plan. https://t.co/Q4fZoG4jFV  The Associated Press (@AP) March 13, 2017The job of the CBO is to analyze proposed legislation and provide Congress with a nonpartisan assessment. Their findings in regards to the GOP plan? By 2026, 24 million Americans will be without healthcare. No wonder they tried to hide it from the public.According to Price, the White House disagrees  strenuously with the report that was put out.  Price said that the CBO isn t looking at the whole picture. He argues that the Republicans have a three-part plan, but the CBO only looked at the House Bill, which is just othe first step. It s just not believable is what we would suggest,  Price said of the CBO s assessment.House Speaker Paul Ryan defended the bill against the report as well. On Monday, he praised the plan for lowering the deficit by a measly $336 billion over a decade, which is a mere drop in the bucket when looking at the overall budget.It is obvious that the Republican s  make America sick again  bill is horrible. People are going to die, plain and simple. The CBO report laid out the numbers. You know, facts and stuff. Yet, the White House and the rest of the GOP just can t believe it so they disagree. Here s the thing, that isn t how it works. You can say you disagree with a fact and you can say you don t believe a fact, but it s still a fact.Millions of people, many of whom just finally got insurance under the Affordable Care Act, are going to lose their coverage under the GOP plan. Saying you don t believe it doesn t change a damn thing.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,13-Mar-17
 Twitter TEARS Paul Ryan To BLOODY RIBBONS For Praising CBO Review Of GOP Healthcare Plan (TWEETS),"The Congressional Budget Office s review of the Republicans  replacement plan for the ACA is out, and it s not good news. Under the plan, 24 million people will lose their healthcare coverage by 2026. 14 million of those people will see their insurance ripped from them just in the next two years. In total, this plan will result in 52 million uninsured people in 2026. Over the next four years, premiums are expected to rise by as much as 20 percent more than they would under the ACA. Premiums might fall for younger people after 2020 but would continue to rise for older people.And on it goes.Paul Ryan, however, sees the report as a resounding endorsement of the plan because it will reduce the deficit by a whole $336 billion over a decade and is supposed to maybe lower premiums at some point in the future.CBO report confirms it   American Health Care Act will lower premiums & improve access to quality, affordable care. https://t.co/jNzmYFPe9H pic.twitter.com/f0NGuLiztl  Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) March 13, 2017And Twitter is throwing a livid fit with him for that tweet, as well they should.

" Billionaire Mark Cuban Just DESTROYED Trump’s Presidency With Some Really, REALLY Bad News (TWEET)","Not many people can get under Donald Trump s skin like billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban. Not only did Cuban become a massively outspoken supporter of Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign, but he s blasted Trump more times than we can count. On Sunday, Cuban was back at it again as he called Trump the  Zoolander president  and made an announcement that s going to have Trump s little hands shaking.In an appearance at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, Cuban admitted that he d originally liked Trump   that is, until he got to know him.  Then, Cuban likened the undeserving POTUS to the incompetent, self-centered movie character Zoolander. Cuban also made fun of Trump s complete lack of intelligence as he joked: Just think how efficient he could be if he learned how to use a search engine. I love the guy because he s the only human being who trolls himself and doesn t know it. Here s a video of Cuban s comments:This recent attack follows a long history of others, each one carrying a sting strong enough to make Trump retaliate and embarrass himself. Last year, Cuban challenged Trump to a four-hour interview about policy, and even offered to donate $1o million to whatever charity Trump wanted   and Trump obviously didn t have the courage to take him up on that. Instead, Trump went on Twitter and said Cuban wasn t  smart enough to understand what s going on.  Just last month, Trump tweeted that Cuban wasn t  smart enough to run for president. Given the fact that Cuban supports policies that are much more grounded in reality, many of us would disagree. Cuban believes in climate change and environmental responsibility, and he is against Trump s immigration policies and thinks all Americans should have health care.Cuban also took another jab at Trump, stating that in the next election, we will need someone who can  look forward,  instead of  acting like it s 1975.  Cuban was asked if he would run for president in the future, and he said something that will truly terrify Trump: I ve got a lot of time to decide and we ll see what happens. Trump, who is delusional enough to think he ll actually serve eight years like former President Barack Obama, is NOT going to be happy about that!

" CBO Posts Review Of Republican Healthcare Plan, It’s A Bloodbath: 24 Million+ Uninsured (DETAILS)","The Congressional Budget Office, tasked with providing Congress with a nonpartisan assessment of the effects of proposed legislation, has finally released its analysis of the Republican healthcare replacement plan   and it s abundantly clearly why Paul Ryan tried to pass the bill before the CBO was able to take a look. It s a bloodbath.For starters, the CBO calculates that as many as 14 million people will lose their insurance within the year, many of which only recently started having health insurance thanks to the ACA. As a  replacement  this plan is clearly inferior. Even worse, by 2026, 24 million more people will be uninsured as compared to this very moment. America will see a near total collapse of the health care system as we currently understand it.Republicans argue that tens of millions more without health insurance is okay because they are saving America money. The CBO suggests the savings would be almost nonexistent relative to the costs (not to mention the human suffering). They calculate that GOP s bill will only save around $300 billion over a decade. Compared to the trillions of dollars that are budgeted out each year, that s a rounding error.#CBO is out   24 million more uninsured by 2026, $337 billion of budget savings over a decade. https://t.co/WlDNX8LEMy  Marc Goldwein (@MarcGoldwein) March 13, 2017They also argue that this disruption will actually cost America around a trillion dollars in lost revenue, offsetting much of the savings it hopes to gain by cutting spending.CBO and JCT estimate that enacting the legislation would reduce federal deficits by $337 billion over the 2017-2026 period. That total consists of $323 billion in on-budget savings and $13 billion in off-budget savings. Outlays [i.e. what the government spends] would be reduced by $1.2 trillion over the period, and revenues would be reduced by $0.9 trillion.Yeah, this is very, very bad.And Republicans did not want the American people to see this.WH reading CBO pic.twitter.com/lLkWPXkZei  Eric Boehlert (@EricBoehlert) March 13, 2017Ryan s response will likely be the same one that he s been giving all week. The tens of millions who are about to lose their insurance are actually enjoying the  benefits  of choice.  Choice,  in his mind, translates to being rich and having health insurance (also a tax break) or poor and not having health insurance. That s freedom to Paul Ryan. What a guy.The CBO s review only reinforces the fact that the Republicans had 8 years to come up with a replacement plan, failed to do so, and when pressed quickly created one that is inferior to the ACA in every single way. The level of incompetence and cruelty required to draft something like this continues to remain astonishing.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,13-Mar-17
 WATCH: Sean Spicer Just Made Trump’s Wiretap Accusation Look Like The Lie That It Is,"For a week now, the world has been up in arms about Trump accusing former President Obama of wiretapping his tower to spy on his White House campaign. The House Intelligence Committee has demanded Trump turn over any and all evidence he s got that supports that accusation, and there s also the possibility that he s committed obstruction of justice just by tweeting about it.So, of course, the White House press corps was asking Sean Spicer about all of this during today s press briefing. He said: The president made very clear in his tweet that it was  wiretapping. Those quotation marks above aren t an accident. Watch what he did below:Basically, Spicer stood at the podium in the White House press room, in front of the press corps, and put air quotes around the word  wiretapping.  Air quotes tend to serve the same purpose as scare quotes in writing   they re used to create doubt around a word or phrase. Spicer just put doubt around Trump s accusation of wiretaps. Literally.Now, it s entirely possible that Spicer just thought he was placing emphasis on  wiretapping,  or that he s just clueless enough not to know what air quotes like that imply. But it doesn t matter what he thought he was doing. It matters what he did, and he just cemented the doubt surrounding Trump s wiretap accusation.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,13-Mar-17
 Trump Is Going To Kill A Coastline Program That Benefits Our Economy And Environment,"If Donald Trump really cared about creating jobs and strengthening the economy he would not be trying to gut this small-but-critical program.It s been around since 1966, and it has greatly benefited coastal regions by generating tens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars for the American economy every year while improving the safety and protection of our coastlines. And now it s being threatened by Trump.The Sea Grant program is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. The $73 million in funding helps 3,000 scientists around the country improve water quality, advise the fishing industry to keep it sustainable, and keep an eye on sea-level rise that could drown coastal cities.The program has been instrumental in the economic development of coastal regions. According to NOAA, the tiny program generated $575 million in economic development and more than 20,000 jobs in 2015 alone. In other words, this program has been a worthwhile investment for the government that has resulted in a huge return for the American people. If Trump intends to continue to try to run the government like a business, gutting this program would be a terrible business decision.Trump has repeatedly claimed that he will create jobs in America. But cutting this program would do the exact opposite. It would also endanger every person who works and lives on or near a coastline.Climate change has caused sea levels to rise in recent years and the Sea Grant program helps scientists predict which parts of our coastlines need to prepare to prevent disaster.Slashing the program would make that work more difficult.And Trump s reason for considering the elimination of the program is galling. He wants to cut it and use the money to pay for an even more bloated defense budget, which is already so big that even if we cut it in half American would still spend more on the military than any other nation on Earth.In reaction to Trump s plan, Sea Grant directors around the country expressed horror. My initial reaction was horror and disgust,  California Sea Grant Director Jim Eckman said.  I think we re facing a much graver crisis that we re going to have to deal with. I have to assume there are some wise people in our Congress who see the flaw,  Maine Sea Grant Director Paul Anderson said of Trump s plan.  Mr. Trump is setting up for a political battle. Indeed, the last time a Republican president targeted Sea Grant there was a strong backlash in Congress because the program does so much that benefits coastal economies and the environment. In 1981, Congress backed the Sea Grant program as Ronald Reagan sought to kill it. He backed down after an analysis showed that the 14 year, $270 million investment in the program by the government yielded a return of over $3 billion. As noted earlier, in 2015 the program created 20,000 jobs and over half a billion dollars in economic development. That s a single year of what this program has done. It s one of the most successful and beneficial government programs ever created and now Trump wants to kill it.Last time I checked, there are several conservative states that have coastlines and those states have also greatly benefited from the Sea Grant program. So Trump is not just hurting more liberal states by gutting this program. He is hurting people who voted for him and Republicans.Featured image via Jim Lo   Pool/Getty Images",News,13-Mar-17
 Jeb Bush BLASTS Steve King’s Anti-Immigrant Racism In Awesome Twitter Burn,"Representative Steve King ( R-Iowa) is a notorious racist. On Sunday, he came under fire for xenophobic comments suggesting that immigration is bad for America and western civilization, and on Monday, he doubled down on those comments. He has even said that non-white people have historically contributed nothing to the building of western civilization and values.

 New York Times Columnist BLASTS ‘Parasite’ Trump’s First 50 Days In Office,"Donald Trump is 50 days into his presidency and and he has done nothing but cheat the American people while destroying and embarrassing our country.America does not have a president. America has a petulant child who acts more like a fascist dictator who whines all the time.Trump doesn t know what the hell he is doing most of the time and resorts to posting on Twitter and blaming others for his failures.In addition, Trump has swindled taxpayers out of millions of dollars to pay for his lavish lifestyle of golf and fancy resorts.Trump is not a human being, he s a parasite.And New York Times columnist Charles Blow used the exact same term while reviewing Trump s first 50 days in office. There is no new Trump,  Blow began.  There is only the same old Trump: Dangerous and unpredictable, gauche and greedy, temperamentally unsuited and emotionally unsound. If you were trying to create in a lab a person with character traits more unbecoming in a president, it would be hard to outdo the one we have. Blow noted that Trump s Twitter ravings make him look  unhinged,  and that he has squandered our credibility as a nation because of his constant lies and false accusations. Trump s assaults on the truth are not benign,  Blow wrote.  Presidential credibility is American credibility. There is no way to burn through one without burning through the other. And when he s not making explosive charges, he s taking destructive actions. Indeed, Trump has relied on executive orders and executive actions far more than President Obama ever did, despite complaining about President Obama every time he signed an executive order.Trump is actually on pace to surpass the number of executive orders President Obama signed. How s that for hypocrisy?You know what else Trump is going to do more than President Obama? Spending money on vacations and golfing.Throughout his entire eight years in office, President Obama s vacations costed taxpayers $90 million. Trump is on pace to spend more than that in under a year. This president and his family are burning through taxpayer funds like it s Monopoly money,  Blow continued.  Trump appears to view the Treasury as a personal piggy bank and the presidency as a part-time job. Blow then delivers a scathing conclusion. This is a 70-year-old man who has lived his entire life as the vile, dishonest, incurious creature who got elected. That election validated his impulses rather than served as a curb on them.Trump will continue to debase and devalue the presidency with his lies. Trump will continue to follow Bannon s philosophy of internal deconstruction of our government, its principles and its institutions. And Trump will continue to leech as much personal financial advantage as he can from the flesh of the American public.That s who Trump is. America elected a parasite.

" Trump Threatens ‘Rude’ Media, Whines That Reporters Won’t ‘Be Nice’ To Him (TWEET)","Donald Trump is starting another week in the White House with yet another attack on the media and the reporters that dare to cover his minions accurately.On Monday morning, Trump took to Twitter to warn the media to  be nice  to him and his dishonest team. Likely inspired by a set of recent interviews in which his senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, was blasted and taken to task for her ridiculous defense of Trump s wiretapping claims, Trump tweeted this little gem: It is amazing how rude much of the media is to my very hard working representatives. Be nice, you will do much better! Perhaps Trump and his team might  do better  if they followed his advice, too   considering they ve made more enemies in the last few weeks than any administration in modern American history.And this wasn t Trump s only attack on the media, either. After watching Morning Joe hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski criticize his presidency for the last several weeks, Trump finally made the decision to unfollow them on Twitter. Seriously, it s almost as if we have a teenager living in the White House.If Trump wants the media to cover him more favorably, then perhaps he might try actually doing his job well for once   or just doing his job, period. Trump is the laziest, most incompetent POTUS America has ever had and his team is just as much as a failure.If the coverage has been negative, it s because Trump and his people actually suck, plain and simple. But instead of trying to improve and fix what is being criticized, Trump would rather just go on Twitter, bully the media, and cry about it.Featured image is a screenshot",News,13-Mar-17
" Trump Admits ‘2017 Will Be The Worst Year Yet,’ Then Blames Obama","While Donald Trump was campaigning, he slammed what he called political correctness in America s culture.

That s rich coming from a guy whose vile attacks are well documented. Trump calls outlets critical of his alleged presidency  fake news  while he reads Infowars and Breitbart. Republicans have had 7 years to come up with a viable replacement for Obamacare and they presented the public with a godawful plan which will leave millions of Americans without coverage.Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a Republican alternative that would provide  insurance for everybody  at a lower price but that s not what s happening. It does give a healthy tax break to the wealthy, though. It s a great plan if you re rich, but if you re of low-income status and/or older, you re fucked.Each crazy-time tweet of Trump s is well calculated. It s a distraction from his many scandals. Let s see now: Russia, conflicts of interest, lack of transparency and  profiting greatly from the presidency.Meanwhile, the Intelligence panel wants Trump to provide evidence of his claims that former President Barack Obama had his phones wiretapped before the election.

" Steve King Tries To Defend White Supremacist Tweet; He Just Made Things Much, Much Worse (VIDEO)","Iowa Rep. Steve King (R-Of Course) is currently under fire for tweeting out something that would only be said by a white supremacist   that we can t  restore our civilization with somebody else s babies. While King s message earned ALLCAPS praise from former KKK leader David Duke, the rest of us are left wondering why Iowans would want this alleged man to represent their state.On Monday, King stopped by CNN to attempt to explain away his hateful tweet, and it didn t go well for him at all. Well, of course I meant exactly what I said,  King told CNN s  New Day  as he blamed  the Left  for wanting to destroy  Western civilization : This is an effort on the left, I think, to break down the American civilization, the American culture, and turn it into something entirely different. I m a champion for western civilization and yes our English language is a big part of it. It s a carrier of freedom. Embarrassingly, King refused to say that Muslim-Americans, Christian-Americans, and other Americans of different background are equal, instead saying that they contribute differently to our culture and our civilization. I d say they re all created in the image of God, and they re equal in his eyes. And if they re citizens of the United States, they re equal in the eyes of the law,  King said.  Individuals will contribute differently not equally to this civilization and certain groups of people will contribute more to this society than other groups of people will, that s just a statistical fact. King says he is  promoting the birth rate in America  to restore the  rule of law  to what he views as a  superior civilization. In short, he thinks white people need to have more babies.Watch the video below:Rep.

 Trump Just Broke Another MAJOR Campaign Promise And People Are Outraged,"Amateur president Donald Trump pledged to forego a presidential salary and his spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in mid-January that the former reality show star  is required to get a paycheck but will be giving it back to (the) treasury or donating.  In 2015, Trump said,  I won t take even one dollar. I am totally giving up my salary if I become president. However, Trump s second payday is quickly approaching and the White House is declining to say if the alleged president has donated any of his earnings yet, NBC reports.Here is Trump pledging to his supporters in 2015 that he will forgo his salary:To follow up on Trump s pledge, MSNBC requested details and documentation regarding any salary donations from the White House, the Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management, but all declined to say whether Trump has donated any the salary due to him.Article II of the Constitution requires a president to be paid so Trump promised to only accept $1.00. That added to Trump s populist appeal but now he s not being transparent about his pledge after the election.Here s where it gets even worse.During the transition, Trump also unveiled a plan to  donate all profits from foreign governments  patronage of his hotels and similar businesses  to the Treasury Department. The plan was released by Trump s private law firm, Morgan Lewis, but no system or accounting has been released for how or when such donations will be processed or disclosed.A president earns $400,000 and is afforded a $50,000 expense account. Trump has broken many promises to his supporters. Mexico will not pay for the wall. We, the taxpayers, will foot the bill. Hillary Clinton won t be locked up. But, he is trying to repeal Obamacare, a move which would largely affect Trump supporters. As for his  Drain the swamp  slogan during his campaign, he s filled it to the brim with bankers and billionaires.We re thinking that Trump really doesn t need a salary. He has already greatly profited from the presidency.Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,12-Mar-17
 Sean Spicer Just Got Caught On Camera Saying Something Horrifyingly Racist (VIDEO),"A woman confronted notorious coward, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, inside a DC Apple store, and found herself the victim of a rather racist attack as a result. Twitter user ShreeC saw Spicer shopping (apparently, he doesn t need to choose between health care and an iPhone) and could not resist the urge to confront him. How does it feel to work for a fascist? Have you helped with the Russia stuff? Are you a criminal as well?  she asked Spicy.  Have you committed treason too, just like the President?  Spicer didn t have an answer to those questions, but he did have some remarks that could only be interpreted as being about her skin color, telling the woman   who is a U.S. citizen   that America is   such a great country that allows you to be here. Asking @PressSec questions in Apple Store since he doesn't like the press. https://t.co/l493z2gG4x  Shree  ? ??

But Spicer decided that since this woman s skin color was on the darker side of beige, she doesn t belong and is blessed that we tolerate her at all   because that is the mindset of the Trump administration.This brave woman walked up to the Joseph Goebbels of our time and confronted him, forcing him to reveal who he truly is.

 Meet The Woman Running Against White Supremacist Steve King In Iowa – This Is How To Help Her Win,"If you haven t heard about Rep. Steve King s (R-IA) white supremacy tweet by now, you re really not paying attention. While citing a Twitter account called  Voice of Europe  that demonized the religion of Islam, King tweeted: Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies. Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies. https://t.co/4nxLipafWO  Steve King (@SteveKingIA) March 12, 2017Basically saying, in so many words, the only babies needed are white babies. A classic white supremacist trope that is code for a form of ethnic cleansing.It s outrageous that King has won time and time again in the 4th Congressional District in Iowa, even winning again this past November for an eighth time. It seems pretty revealing of the voting populace of that district.However, there is one woman who is steadfast in defeating King and bringing sanity and decency back to the 4th Congressional District in Iowa. That woman is Kim Weaver. And even though King defeated her in 2016, she never stopped fighting, and is continuing her mission to defeat him in the 2018 midterms.There is only one way she ll win, though, and that is with the help of not only those within her district, but from nationwide support. After all, Congressional races affect the entirety of the United States because each representative is a vote in Congress which helps determines policy for the entire nation.Working day and night to replace Steve King in Iowa's 4th Congressional District. All help is greatly appreciated! https://t.co/i0cM36lvlg  Kim Weaver (@KimWeaverIA) September 14, 2016And don t just support Weaver because she s battling Steve King. Support her because she s a great candidate. According to The Des Moines Register: Weaver works as an advocate for seniors in nursing homes, assisted living and residential care facilities with the Office of the State Long-term Care Ombudsman. She also has been a Medicaid case manager and a care provider for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. So her emphasis on issues for seniors comes from working with people who struggle to pay for long-term care or can t find assistance to stay in their homes.She s also a single mother of three young adults: a son with an aerospace engineering degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a daughter in medical school at University of Iowa and a son majoring in geology at Iowa State. So her concern about burdening the next generation under a mountain of college debt comes from worrying about her own children. Further: One of Weaver s more creative ideas is an attempt to simultaneously address two problems: college affordability and care for seniors. She advocates creating a national volunteer program to allow high school students to earn financial credit toward future tuition. She s hoping that some of those volunteer hours might be involved with helping seniors with cleaning, yard work and other chores so they can stay in their homes. Everyone seems to be treating Weaver like she doesn t stand a chance, but we have the chance to help her prove everyone wrong.You can help Weaver by going HERE, and then making sure everyone else does, too. In addition, you can spread the word on social media. The good thing about Congressional races is that they happen every two years. No one is safe from being ousted. No election is a sure thing. Let s make sure white supremacist Rep. Steve King knows that he has something to worry about in Kim Weaver.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images   Iowa Public Television",News,12-Mar-17
 GOP Announced Their Obamacare Replacement – Bernie Sanders Just DESTROYED It In Under 2 Minutes (VIDEO),"Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has been a nightmare for the GOP ever since he announced his presidential campaign. With his amazing ability to connect with progressives and activists in America, Sanders has been a massive thorn in the Republican Party s side as he routinely dismantles every crooked policy they try to enact.The Republican Party s latest disastrous move is their Obamacare replacement plan, which has attracted criticism from the second it was announced. It only makes sense that Sanders would weigh in on such a repulsive move, and it only took him 82 seconds to dismantle what House Speaker Paul Ryan wants to use to replace Obamacare.On CBS s Face The Nation, Sanders gave a damning response to a question about whether or not the GOP s replacement would get 51 votes in the Senate. He said: I hope not. It is an absolute disaster. It is a disgrace, and by the way, this really has nothing to do with healthcare. What this has everything to do with is a massive shift of wealth from working people and middle-income people to the richest people in this country. It is a 275 billion dollar tax break for the top two percent. Millionaires will get about $50,000 a year in tax breaks, while at the same time 5-10 million people are going to lose their health insurance, premiums are going to soar. The AARP says that if you are 64 years of age and you re making about 25,000 a year, you re going pay up to $7,000 more for you re health insurance. They re going to defund Planned Parenthood. Deny over 2 million the right to choose they healthcare that they need. They re going to decimate Medicaid, which is why the American Medical Association, the AMA, and the American Hospital Association oppose it, in addition to the AARP. This is a disgrace, and by the way, they are so cowardly that they want to go forward before the CBO gives an estimate of what it will cost, and how many people will lose their insurance. You can watch Sanders explain it all below:Sanders couldn t be more correct. The GOP s replacement is a massive failure and will not only strip millions of Americans of life-saving health care, but it will make Americans pay more for less.The Republicans are trying to promote their own interests with this bill, and it s absolutely pathetic. The ones who will truly benefit from such a horrible piece of legislation are the wealthy and insurance companies. Hopefully, people will listen to Sanders and fight this bill.Featured image is a screenshot",News,12-Mar-17
 Donald Trump Jr. Expects Us To Believe He Has ‘Zero Contact’ With His Father,"Donald Trump Jr. apparently expects the world to believe that he has had  zero contact  with his father since he was sworn into office. So no need to worry about all that pesky conflict of interest stuff. Nothing to see here, folks!Speaking at a GOP fundraiser in Dallas on Saturday, Trump Jr. told the crowd that he no longer has any real communications with his dad now that he is the president. I basically have zero contact with him at this point,  Trump Jr. claimed with a straight face.Trump s son said he believed that he would be  out of politics  and could just return to his regular life  once the election was finally over.  But I couldn t,  he said. Deals are still exciting,  he added.  But when you re the sort of guy out there every day, 24-7 fighting in this thing   it s like a great fight. Trump supposedly gave all control of his businesses to his two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, when he became president and his assets were to be placed into a trust. But so far, he has offered nothing to prove that he has actually done any of this. The closest he has come to verifying that he has divested himself from his business interests is a stack of folders he pointed to at a press conference that supposedly held the proof.The Office of Government and Ethics (OGE) has cried foul over this arrangement from the very beginning, saying Trump s entire plan is wholly inadequate  when it comes to resolving his many conflicts of interest.After claiming that they just don t have the time to talk to one another anymore, Trump Jr. also took the opportunity to stroke his daddy s ego during this weekend s fundraiser.  I m watching more take place in two months than I saw in two terms before,  he said.Featured image via Jeff Vinnick/Getty Images",News,12-Mar-17
 GOP Rep. Steve King Just Went FULL White Supremacist – David Duke Is Cheering (TWEETS),"While it should surprise absolutely no one that Iowa Rep. Steve King is a blatant, flaming, disgusting pig of a racist, what he just did on Twitter puts him into the same category as the KKK and the Neo-Nazis here in the U.S. He met with two white supremacist demagogues Geert Wilders from the Netherlands and Frauke Petry from Germany in 2016 and expressed strong support for their ahem anti-immigrant policies. But today, he not only doubled down on that, he was so obviously white supremacist he earned accolades for it from one David Duke.King tweeted a cartoon from Voice of Europe, a publication that could easily be a  Make America Great Again  publication for Trump if it was American. It says:Hundreds of Islamists shouting  Allahu Akbar  in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Wilders is right for over 10 years. #turkijerel pic.twitter.com/dV2SjXg23r  Voice of Europe (@V_of_Europe) March 12, 2017King, not to be outdone on the white supremacy front, then tweeted:Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies. https://t.co/4nxLipafWO  Steve King (@SteveKingIA) March 12, 2017In other words, King just said that culture is rooted in demographics, which implies that he believes the only way to preserve true American and Western European culture is to preserve white superiority. That s what known white nationalist groups also say about brown people polluting the white gene pool.Now, read what David Duke s reply was to that:Just in case you were thinking about moving -> sanity reigns supreme in Iowa s 4th congressional district.#MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/RRjTzAzlKw  David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) March 12, 2017 Reigns supreme.

 WATCH: Trump’s Wiretap Accusation BLOWN WIDE OPEN – He May Be Guilty Of Obstruction Of Justice,"Trump just can t stop embroiling himself in scandal, and his week-old accusation that the Obama administration wiretapped his tower is just getting bigger and bigger. Congress is demanding his evidence. Various House Republicans have said they have no evidence. FBI Director James Comey has publicly denied the claims. And now it seems that stupid attempt to make Obama look like a criminal may, in fact, make him guilty of obstruction of justice. That is an impeachable offense.Back in November, a right-leaning website, Heat Street, reported on the existence of a FISA warrant that would allow the FBI to monitor two Russian banks that were communicating with a server in Trump Tower. That s all   reporter Louise Mensch didn t say that any wiretaps actually existed.In talking to MSNBC today, Mensch dropped a bombshell on Trump s claims. She flat said: For once, I think it s possible the president does not have a fake news problem. I think he may have a real news problem, being that, what if there really is a wiretap at Trump Tower? The problem the president has then is that I didn t report that, and neither did any other journalist, which means that if he tweeted evidence in an ongoing, top-secret case, then he obstructed justice, and that s an impeachable offense. She goes on to say that she believes the reason the White House has more or less gone silent is not the possibility that the wiretap claims are fake   it s the possibility that they re real. Trump could have gotten himself in a world of shit with those tweets.She also says that the White House s desperation to find a member of the press who reported the wiretaps before Trump did is because they re terrified that he committed obstruction of justice. Nobody in the press ever said there was a wiretap. The press reported on his accusations and the FISA warrant. Big difference.Watch below:Featured image by Olivier Douliery via Getty Images",News,12-Mar-17
 WATCH: Rachel Maddow Has PERFECT Argument To Prove Trump Is A Failure Despite His Bragging,"Donald Trump can brag all he wants, but Rachel Maddow knows that Trump s presidency has been nothing but a disastrous failure.Despite the constant bragging, Trump has proven himself to be a historic failure.Usually, the first 100 days of an administration is productive and with Republicans in control of the Senate and House, it should be easier to get things done.But Trump has only governed via bad executive orders and has taken a vacation every weekend while accusing everyone from President Obama to Democrats to the media to other government officials of somehow sabotaging him.On Sunday, Maddow discussed Trump s failure with Al Sharpton and made a strong case that Trump s has been one policy disaster after another. If you just look at what they ve done in terms of policy it s interesting they haven t been able to do anything successfully on any of the stuff they like to brag about, they like to talk about, that he campaigned on,  Maddow began.For example, Trump s Muslim bans have failed to pass muster as federal courts are blocking it because it violates the Constitution. Trump s border wall has also failed because he promised that Mexico would pay for it but it turns out that was a total lie. In fact, Trump s wall would actually cost us dearly because it would weaken our national security. The Muslim ban has been a disaster,  Maddow continued before noting that Mitch McConnell admitted that Mexico won t pay for the wall. She also referred to Trump s plan to gut the Coast Guard, airport security, and FEMA to pay for it.Maddow also mentioned that Trump is allowing mentally ill people to buy guns and is refusing to fight a Texas voter suppression law in court.And then she brought up the GOP healthcare bill that they dubiously call the  American Healthcare Act  even though is definitely not American nor is it healthcare. The health care roll-out is an absolute disaster. Politically, it s absolutely dead. I don t think anybody believes it will ever pass the Senate. They never tried anything on taxes. Remember, they were going to do a trillion dollar infrastructure plan. Nothing that they like to talk about, nothing they like to brag about, none of their big stuff is working or, in many cases, they re not even trying to make it work. Here s the video via Twitter.Democrats would be wise to echo argument Maddow makes here. It s incredibly effective, and conveniently truthful. https://t.co/a3F4hdbPbQ  Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) March 12, 2017In short, Donald Trump continues to be a failure and a disaster for our country and it will only get worse.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,12-Mar-17

 WATCH: Trump Minion Makes HUGE Slip About Who Will Pay For Infrastructure Spending,"The American people are NOT going to like this at all.If you really believed that Donald Trump cares about working people and America, this interview will shatter your delusions.Trump has promised to make infrastructure spending a top priority in his administration and it s expected to carry at least a $1 trillion price tag.Usually, every American who pays taxes, from the rich to the poor and from corporations to small businesses, helps pay the bill.But Trump s scheme would not only enrich his corporate buddies, it would allow foreigners to fleece the American people as well for decades by reimbursing private companies through the use of tolls on roads and bridges, which would be privately owned.During an interview with Sean Hannity last week, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who also happens to be Mitch McConnell s wife, let the cat out of the bag when she admitted that working Americans would be saddled with the costs of the projects and that would also mean paying tolls to enrich foreign investors. After explaining it, Hannity attempted to bail her out by spinning it as a  win win  for taxpayers. If I m hearing it properly, what you re saying is, for example, if a company were to rebuild a road, they might get their investment back by having a toll on that road and that s where the taxpayers don t pay a penny, they make a profit, it s a win-win? Something like that?  Hannity said. Thanks for putting it that way,  Chao replied.Except that it s not a  win-win.  Basically, Trump s plan would allow private companies to pay for building or repairing a road or bridge and then they would force Americans to pay a toll so the company would make their money back and profit off the backs of every American who uses the road or bridge to get to work every day. Companies would literally be nickel and diming the people, and it would be the local citizens who get hit the hardest.Saying that taxpayers  don t pay a penny  is a complete lie.But that s not all.Chao repeatedly slipped up when she tried to explain that private investors would fund the roads. So, basically, we allow foreign inv uh, we allow different kinds of money, private sector money to come into the United States I m not saying foreign to come and fund, let s say a bridge or a road or it can be any kind of infrastructure. That s right. Chao just admitted that foreign investors would also be able to basically own American roads and make us pay them to use them. And Cenk Uygur knows why.Uygur explained on his Young Turks show that Chao is the daughter of a Taiwanese businessman who got rich investing in transportation.That means Chao and her family could personally enrich themselves under Trump s scheme.Here s the Hannity interview and Uygur s commentary via Twitter.Transportation Secretary @ElaineChao may have accidentally let her true intentions slip during a @seanhannnity interview. pic.twitter.com/2yIR25BtRy  The Young Turks (@TheYoungTurks) March 12, 2017Once again, Donald Trump is scamming working Americans to make himself and his friends rich while the rest of us pay the bill for the rest of our lives. Our infrastructure would literally be owned and operated by private companies and foreigners while we pay the price. It s unfair. It s un-American. And it should piss off every American citizen.Featured image via screenshot",News,12-Mar-17
 WATCH: Ivanka Trump Gets SKEWERED By Saturday Night Live For Helping Her Crazy Dad,"Ivanka Trump is complicit in what her father Donald Trump is doing to America and Saturday Night Live hilariously made sure everyone knows about it.In yet another classic commercial spoof, Saturday Night Live brilliantly mocked Ivanka, portrayed by Scarlett Johansson, with an advertisement for a perfume called  Complicit. As dressed in gold Ivanka walks across a ballroom where champagne is being served and guests are gawking at her as a narrator speaks highly about her without choking on the words. Every man knows her name. Every woman knows her face. When she walks into a room, all eyes are on her. She s Ivanka. And a woman like her deserves a fragrance all her own. A scent made just for her. Because she s beautiful, she s powerful, she s Complicit. She s a woman who knows what she wants,  the narrator continues.  And knows what she s doing. Complicit. Ivanka then walks up to a mirror and applies lipstick but her reflection is that of her father as played by Alec Baldwin. She doesn t crave the spotlight, but we see her. Oh, how we see her. The narrator then goes on to describe Ivanka using terms like  feminist  but has no idea why they apply to her. A feminist, an advocate, a champion for women,  the narrator says.  But, like, how? She s loyal. Devoted, but probably should ve bounced after that whole Access Hollywood bus thing,  the narration continued in reference to Donald Trump bragging about grabbing women s genitals without their consent.  Oh well,  Ivanka said.The commercial then concluded with an epic and accurate slogan for the  Complicit  perfume. For the woman who could stop all this   but won t. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, Ivanka Trump has a lot of influence over her father but she has failed to use it. Instead, white nationalists like Steve Bannon are pulling the strings and America is suffering for it.

 John McCain Says Trump Is F*cked: ‘Lots Of Shoes To Drop From This Centipede’ (VIDEO),"According to Senator John McCain, Donald Trump s life is about get become very uncomfortable very quickly. During an appearance on CNN s  State of the Union,  McCain explained that he was bothered by a number of things involving Trump and Russia, including the strange removal of a call for defensive weapons to the Ukraine to defend against Russia from the official party platform. Clearly, it was not the will of most Republicans,  McCain told Jake Tapper Sunday, adding that there are plenty of shoes about to drop.  There s a lot of aspects with this whole relationship with Russia and Vladimir Putin that requires further scrutiny, and so far I don t think the American people have gotten all the answers. In fact, I think there s a lot of shoes to drop from this centipede. This whole issue of the relationship with the Russians and who communicated with them and under what circumstances clearly cries out for an investigation,  McCain says.  But I would also point out we should not assume guilt until we have a thorough investigation. I m not judging anyone guilty. Unfortunately, McCain s fellow Republicans are doing all they can to avoid investigating the Trump administration s numerous and growing list of shady contacts with Russian oligarchs   though Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who perjured himself when he was asked about Russian contacts during his confirmation hearing, has said he may appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Donald Trump s baseless allegations that President Obama tapped his  wires  at Trump Tower.Watch the interview below:Tapper asks John McCain about the Flynn-Turkey revelations; McCain starts talking about Russia, Russia, Russia. https://t.co/Z9hFrrF6Sx  Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) March 12, 2017Featured image via screengrab",News,12-Mar-17
 WATCH: Chris Wallace NAILS Trump For Touting Jobs Reports He Once Called ‘Phony’,"Donald Trump is the ultimate hypocrite and Fox host Chris Wallace called him out for it on Sunday.During the campaign, Trump repeatedly bashed positive monthly jobs reports by claiming that they were somehow being faked by President Obama to make it appear that the economy was improving under his watch. Trump dismissed the low unemployment rate as well, claiming that he  heard  that it was much higher, as high as 42 percent, which is an outrageous lie.Chris Wallace played footage of this while interviewing Trump s chief economic adviser and former Goldman Sachs executive. You know, the same Goldman Sachs that Donald Trump repeatedly vilified during the campaign because of Hillary Clinton s ties to them.Anyway, Wallace pointed out that while Trump is touting the recent February jobs report that shows the economy added 235,000 jobs and the unemployment rate dropped from 4.8 to 4.7 percent, he is clearly being a hypocrite because he called previous jobs reports  phony. If that s true, why should we believe these numbers?  Wallace demanded to know before noting that Trump inherited a strengthening economy from the Obama administration.  And the fact is, did you inherit an economy that has been for the last 18 months somewhere between 4.6 and 5 percent unemployment? Of course, rather than admit that Trump is full of shit, Cohn ignored the question and made it sound like Trump is an economic hero. The economy continues to grow and we are doing out part, Cohn said before claiming that CEOs are telling Trump that they are adding jobs because of him. We are creating these jobs because of you, Mr. President, and your policies.  Which have not, yet, come into any sort of effect.Here s the video via YouTube:The bottom line is that the economy is continuing to grow because of President Obama s economic policies. Many of the investment plans that companies are announcing right now were in motion well before the election in November. But Trump has been desperately trying to take credit for the economy.So let s all remember how Trump is currently taking credit for all the good economic news. Because once the economy implodes under his watch, he ll definitely try to blame the black guy for it.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,12-Mar-17
 Intelligence Committee Warns Trump: Produce Wiretapping Evidence By Monday,"Last Saturday, Donald Trump woke at the crack of dawn and went on an extraordinary Twitter tirade   even for him. He accused his predecessor, President Barack Obama, of illegally wiretapping Trump Tower during the hotly contested 2016 election campaign. This is a most outrageous claim to make about a former president   especially since a president cannot legally order such surveillance on any American citizen. So, if indeed Trump s claims were to turn out to be true (hint: they won t), it would have come first from a request by the FBI, and said request would have been reviewed and granted by a judge. In other words, if this did happen, it would mean that there was ample evidence that criminal activity was occurring in Trump Tower at that point in time.The worst part of this whole claim is that it was said via Twitter with absolutely no evidence whatsoever. If Trump did have evidence, surely he would have produced it by now. Well, he has also demanded that House and Senate Intelligence Committees find the evidence that he clearly does not have, and they re tired of his lies and shenanigans surrounding this issue. They are so sick of it, in fact, that they have demanded evidence of Trump s claims against President Obama be presented to them by Monday.This request comes courtesy of House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA) and Ranking Member Adam Schiff (D-CA). Schiff has called what Trump did via Twitter last Saturday  outlandish  and  destructive.  He s right. If any evidence were to exist (another hint: it doesn t) Trump or someone within the federal government would have made said evidence public by now just to kill the story.Trump has really stepped in it with this one. He flat-out lied about who is perhaps the most honorable man to ever occupy the White House. Then again   lest we forget   Trump started his political career by leading the racist birther crusade. So, we really shouldn t be surprised at his behavior here.Featured image via Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty Images",News,12-Mar-17
 Congress Sends Trump A SERIOUS Warning About His Tweeting,"Trump and his Twitter habit may be breaking federal law, especially insofar as misspellings and other stupid errors, because he deletes and then reposts as though he thinks nobody will notice (he should take a hint   we all notice). Because of that, Elijah Cummings and, amazingly enough, Jason Chaffetz, sent an official letter of warning to Trump about deleting his tweets because doing so could be in violation of the Presidential Records Act.Chaffetz and Cummings sent their letter to White House counsel Don McGahn, and said: President Trump uses at least two Twitter accounts: an official White House account (@POTUS) and an account that predated his inauguration (@realDonaldTrump). Many of the messages sent from these accounts are likely to be presidential records and therefore must be preserved. It has been reported, however, that President Trump has deleted tweets, and if those tweets were not archived it could pose a violation of the Presidential Records Act. So yeah, they think the man that got elected to the White House is actively breaking the law with his Twitter account. It s silly, too   they re asking McGahn to provide any evidence there may be of White House staff receiving training on the PRA. Trump seems to think that a lot of the usual training White House staff gets is unnecessary. He s, like, a smart person, remember.They re asking McGahn to identify senior officials covered by the PRA who have used personal email accounts to conduct government business since Jan. 20. They want names, and the names of alias accounts and other accounts used, along with a whole host of other information to demonstrate that Trump and his staff are in compliance with the law.Speculation has been going around for awhile about whether Trump deleting tweets is illegal now. Forbes published a question from Quora about this same thing way back in February. Carter Moore, a former Congressional aide, said: [It s] very unlikely [that deleting tweets is legal].But while I hate to be too lawyerly about it, it depends on the nature of the tweet and on how thoroughly he deletes it The only  out  that the President would have in deleting a tweet would be if the twet could be argued to be a record of  purely private or nonpublic character which does not relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties of the President. He went on to explain that the law puts responsibility for preserving records on the President, so the countless screencaps of Trump s deleted tweets don t count as preserving presidential records.The White House put an auto-archiving system into place under President Obama so that his tweets, and the tweets of other top officials, were preserved regardless of what happened. Those tweets now belong to the National Archives. That may well still be in effect, but it applies only to official White House accounts. It wouldn t archive tweets from Trump s personal account, which he uses all the damn time.Now that Congress is on Trump s case about this, it ll be interesting to see what happens. Or Trump might tell Congress to go fuck itself, because he s Donald Trump and you don t question Donald Trump.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,12-Mar-17
 Watch Darrel Issa Get Booed After Being A Total D*ck To A Constituent (VIDEO),"There may have been a time, many years ago, when the Republican party gave a crap about its constituents, but those days are long gone. If you haven t seen enough proof of that yet, all you have to do is watch this snippet from a Rep. Darrell Issa town hall in San Diego, California to see where he mocks a constituent who claimed to be assaulted by one of Issa s staff.The woman, who said she is a member of California s Bar (a lawyer) and that she was holding a sign at the town hall which was taken away from her by Issa s  bodyguard,  whom she said assaulted her. I had a very small sign that said, Investigate Russia now,  she explained to the congressman standing on the stage.  There are many other people with signs here. You bodyguard, security guard, came over and took my sign away from me forcibly. I asserted my 1st Amendment rights of free speech. I told him it was suppression of speech. Source: Raw StoryIssa tried blaming it on the size of her sign. Apparently, oversized signs were banned from the event, but the woman insisted it was small. He did apologize, but the woman persisted. Mine was small and it was forcibly taken from me and it constituted a battery,  the woman asserted.  It was your staff. They committed a criminal offense against me. At that point, Ryan had had enough with the woman and said,  well, okay,  while grabbing the mic and said,  We ll go on to somebody who doesn t have a pending lawsuit. The crowd, thankfully, booed.Here s the video:Sadly, this seems to be common behavior among Republicans. Dissent is no longer welcome. They re even attempting to make protesting illegal, or at least very difficult, in many states. In Michigan, for example, lawmakers tried to pass a law that would make picketing illegal by charging a $1,000 fine for each day of picketing. Fortunately, the state Senate didn t pass it, but other bills are even more frightening.In North Dakota, for example, Republicans introduced a bill that would make it legal to run down protesters with cars.Of course, we have an Oval Office occupier who believes that all dissent is  fake  and needs to be shut down. Should it be any surprise that his party follows his example?Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,11-Mar-17
 Trump’s Weekend Jaunts To Florida Are Putting The U.S. In Grave Danger,"Trump s selfishness knows no bounds. He thinks as president and commander-in-chief that he can do what he wants, and others will handle the details. There s one so-called  detail,  however, that he really needs to consider: All that time he spends at Mar-a-Lago? It s not just costing us a bundle. It s a national security nightmare that could be putting us in grave danger, and it grows with each visit.Mar-a-Lago was not built for the U.S. president, it was built as a resort for rich people like Donald Trump. The security risks are astonishing, especially since the guests who frequent the place get less vetting than what Trump thinks Syrian refugees get. That, according to former Secret Service agents and other experts, means spies and other enemies can get at him easily.In fact, two former CIA directors, Michael Hayden and John McLaughlin, both say that foreign intelligence operatives would love to get their hands on Mar-a-Lago, and it would be very easy because the place is so unsecure. They could eavesdrop on conversations and start building dossiers on key officials, and learn national secrets they could then use against us because Trump was relaxed and stupid.Just look at what happened when one of his weekends in February turned into a national security event as North Korea shot off a missile into the Sea of Japan. Guests there were taking pictures of the briefings and discussions and posting them to social media in a massive breach of security, even though Trump later insisted that no sensitive discussions took place, nor was sensitive material in view of his guests.That s not all, though. All of Trump s clubs present these risks because the members are welcome at Mar-a-Lago as he makes a habit of going there every single weekend, and they have access to him at his other clubs as well. That includes his international clubs, meaning foreigners have unsecure access to Trump.Spies wouldn t even have to show up at Mar-a-Lago, or anywhere else. They could bribe or blackmail people close to Trump to get intelligence on us, including key club employees whose names, email addresses and phone numbers are available on Mar-a-Lago s website. The club s managing director has special clearance to get close to Trump. People in positions like that are juicy targets for spies.It s not bad enough that Trump insisted on using a personal, unsecure phone for a lot of his communications, including Twitter (he has a secure phone now, but reports are conflicting about whether he still uses his old, unsecure Android phone). He has make things worse by spending all his weekends at his estate, with people who worship him but could be anyone, or under anyone s influence.Basically, Trump must have all his old habits and he doesn t give a damn about how unsecure they are. That means he doesn t give a damn about U.S. national security. We have a man in the White House who s one of the worst security risks we ve had.Featured image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images",News,11-Mar-17

 Bought And Paid For: Paul Ryan Met With Insurance Lobbyists Before Presenting Trumpcare Plan,"I m not sure why, after nearly a decade of Republicans gleefully sh*tting on the American people, I would suddenly expect that House Speaker Paul Ryan and his cohorts to realize they work for the us, not for the highest bidder. But alas, Ryan, with his gawdawful healthcare bill, that s guaranteed to give 10 million people the boot, while enriching the already rich, proved once again who his real constituents are, and it s not us. If you need proof, Ryan attended a fundraiser with health insurance lobbyists just two hours before rolling out the bill.The two things were related. The Thursday morning breakfast fundraiser he attended was hosted by a lobbying firm working to unwind the Affordable Care Act on behalf of health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield, one of the big winners of Ryan s proposed legislation.The breakfast, according to an invitation, was sponsored by McGuireWoods PAC, the political action committee for the lobbying firm McGuireWoods. Blue Cross Blue Shield pays McGuireWoods $120,000 a year to lobby on changes to health reform, records show. Attendees of the event paid were asked to pitch in as much as $10,000.Source: The InterceptIt seems it was money well spent for the insurance company. The bill would allow insurance executives to make a lot more money. Companies can currently only deduct up to $1 million in salaries, per executive, from their taxes. The bill would remove that cap.It would also allow insurance companies to add a 30 percent surcharge if someone faces hard times and they let their insurance lapse. In other words, poor people will have to pay a lot more   a lot more. It would also put a real burden on the young, who might forgo insurance for now, thinking the 30 percent surcharge might not be a big deal in a few years.There is nothing about this bill that benefits the people of the United States, but Ryan is dressing it up and entering it into what he calls a beauty contest. This beauty contestant, though, is ugly both on the outside and the inside. In fact, what is that smell?Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,11-Mar-17
 WATCH: MSNBC Panel Explains Terrifying Reason Why Trump Is Dangerous For Listening To Racist Conspiracy Nuts,"Since taking office, Donald Trump has surrounded himself with white nationalists and conspiracy theorists, which has made him and even bigger threat to the nation.Trump has repeatedly demonstrated over the last two months that he has absolutely no idea what he is doing and that he basically does whatever his advisers tell him to do.Top adviser Steve Bannon is the de facto president who fills Trump s head with falsehoods and conspiracies, contributing to the atmosphere of infighting and chaos that has gripped the White House and led to decisions that screw over the American people in favor of the racist agenda Trump s minions are pursuing.As we all know, Trump openly accused President Obama of wiretapping him after reading a conspiracy theory on Breitbart, a conservative website that Bannon controlled prior to joining Trump s team.Of course, Trump s accusation was baseless and he has not presented any evidence to prove his claim.The fact that Trump is a puppet controlled by white nationalists who are feeding him conspiracy theories to advance their cause is incredibly frightening, and it was the subject of a discussion by Joy Reid and her Saturday morning panel on MSNBC, a discussion that made it clear why Trump s associates and his behavior are more dangerous than ever before.Reid began by pointing out that Trump is listening to people like Sean Hannity, who literally told Trump to purge anyone who may disagree with him and referred to them as  saboteurs.  Now Trump is actually beginning to purge the government as Hannity demanded.Former CIA terrorism expert Jack Rice responded by saying that Trump should be more worried about Russia and the grip they have over his administration.Then the discussion turned to Trump s closest advisers, who appear to be the real power in the White House. I think actually that is a very important point to make because you do have a president who is surrounded by sort of an alt-state and that is Bannonites   I don t know what you call them,  Reid said. They want this Christian white nationalistic ethno-state, I guess. And people like Steve Bannon, people like Sebastian Gorka, and Stephen Miller. There is a core of people around Donald Trump who want him to keep believing conspiracy theories, who want him to essentially believe President Obama can wiretap him from Hawaii or wherever he happens to be. National security expert Malcolm Nance then chimed in and frighteningly reminded everyone that Trump has 4,000 nuclear weapons at his disposal and that the right conspiracy theory could make him fearful and paranoid enough to use them. We have a conspiracy theory president and I m not even sure whether you can put those three words together in a tangible sentence and use the word president,  Nance began.  He seems to be buying every crazy idea that s out there. Now, granted, the man can t seem to tell the truth about anything. This is dangerous and, as much as it sounds amusing, he controls 4,000 atomic weapons. He controls the levers of power in the United States. if he s going out with Steve King and others in Congress and saying that the president of the   the former president of the United States wiretapped a conversation he had a few weeks ago with the president of Australia, I mean we have got a very serious problem here. Here s the video via YouTube.If that s not enough to convince every American in this country that Trump should not be president, then this country is truly f*cked.Featured Image: Jim Lo Scalzo   Pool/Getty Images",News,11-Mar-17
" Trump Made The Most DELUSIONAL Statement About Obamacare, America’s Response Is PERFECT (TWEETS)","Apparently, Donald Trump has yet to learn his lesson about attacking former President Barack Obama.Last weekend, the disgraceful Tweeter in Chief decided to accuse his beloved predecessor of wiretapping his phones in the Trump Tower before the U.S. election. He immediately regretted this, because his reckless lies ignited not only tons of backlash against him, but also prompted further investigations into the Russia scandal.America has not even recovered from the shock that a current POTUS would accuse a former leader of the free world of doing such a thing. Regardless, Trump took to Twitter Saturday morning to attack Obama again. At around 9:30 am, Trump exercised at least some self-control and only tweeted one anti-Obama message, this time insulting Obamacare while hyping up the GOP s replacement bill (which by the way, is an absolute disaster and pretty much hated by everyone). Trump tweeted:Trump s claim that Obamacare is  imploding  is just as hilarious as it is ridiculous. Of course, there are some things about Obamacare that could use amending. But Americans, for the most part, are very happy with Obamacare and are pissed off that the Republican Party is going to repeal it, stripping millions of people of their health care. Not to mention, the sloppy replacement plan that the GOP is putting in place has already been highly criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike and is sure to be a death sentence for many Americans.Fortunately, America isn t about to let Trump forget that his ideas suck. Once Trump tweeted his attack on Obamacare, Twitter users rushed in to take Trump right off his high horse and bring him back to reality. Here are some of the best responses:      Trump is absolutely delusional if he thinks the GOP s plan is going to put Obamacare to shame   and Americans will make sure he realizes it.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,11-Mar-17
 UNHINGED: White Male GOP Rep. Makes COMPLETELY Off-The-Wall Claim About How ACA Hurt Women,"Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri spent International Women s Day advocating for women   or so we re sure he thought. He s a supporter of the GOP s plan for repealing the ACA, which includes restricting women s access to healthcare via Planned Parenthood, and also severely restricts a woman s right to make choices about her own body. But the 10 percent tax on tanning salons? That has to go because it disproportionately harms women, and he will make sure it goes.As Slate reported: I wanted to see who predominantly is taxed with this tanning tax. Is it men? Is it women? So I went to a little Google search,  he said.  What I found on Google is roughly 80 percent of who s taxed are women. So out of the $600 million that has been created by this tax   $480 million has come from the backs and the pockets of women. Today s International Women Day,  noted Smith, who has advocated for legislation that would defund women s health clinics.  It s interesting that no one is bringing that up. While yes, we could make the argument that we re unfairly taxing women with the tanning bed tax, we have to think about the fact that tanning beds also disproportionately harm women. Tanning beds aren t healthy. They re a leading cause of skin cancer behind the sun (and Smith wonders why we don t tax the sun oh please). They ve led to a massive increase in skin cancer in women under the age of 30.They re also a complete luxury, unlike things like pads and tampons, pap smears, mammograms, pre-natal care, maternity care, hormonal contraception, and yes, abortion. Where is he on all of this stuff? If not taxing women unfairly is so important to him, where was the impassioned plea for states to stop taxing women for pads and tampons?As far as abortion, he believes in shifting from abortion to adoption, and overturning Roe v. Wade, which is just going to send us back to the days of back-alley abortions, coat hanger abortions, and women dying because of these things. It could also lead to more women unnecessarily dying in childbirth, or being forced to carry a non-viable fetus (even a dead fetus) to term. Why is he not pleading for Congress to make sure none of this happens by enacting legislation that s proven to lower the abortion rate and improve the odds for pregnant women and their babies?This is a man who s dismissed the idea that cutting Medicaid, including its funding to Planned Parenthood, would leave more Americans without coverage. Stripping Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood would leave low-income women without access to basic women s care and birth control, which is most of what they do.But no, the tanning bed tax is the worst thing we ever did to women, in his view.If he wants to stand up for women s rights, he d stop with his faux, pseudo-feminist pleas and actually work towards policies that have been proven to help women and their families, and lower the abortion rate. This is just shameful.Featured image by Darin Morley, CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia",News,11-Mar-17
 Top Intelligence Committee Member: ‘No Evidence’ To Back Up Trump’s Bogus Wiretap Claims,"FBI Director James Comey met with the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday to discuss Donald Trump s claim that former President Obama had his  wires tapped  at Trump Tower during the election. A day later, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee said that he hasn t seen one shred of evidence to back up Trump s bogus claim.Rep. Adam Schiff is a member of what is known as the  Gang of Eight,  which is the group of House members who are privy to the most classified information out there. Schiff said that Thursday s meeting with Comey didn t provide the committee with any evidence whatsoever that Trump s phones had been tapped by Obama or anyone else. I think when Sean Spicer isn t even willing to talk about it, you know there s a real problem,  Schiff told CNN.Rep. Devin Nunes, who is the Republican heading up the intelligence committee, said earlier this week that he hadn t seen any evidence to support Trump s wiretapping claims either. After meeting with Comey, he said that nothing had changed.Comey has said previously that Trump is full of it when it comes to the allegations of his phones being tapped. Schiff thinks Comey will answer questions regarding this fiasco during a committee hearing scheduled for later this month. He certainly is prepared for the question,  Schiff told CNN.  I don t see any reason why he wouldn t answer it. He might even welcome the opportunity. Trump decided last weekend that he would get on Twitter and accuse Obama of tapping the phones at Trump Tower, even if he had no evidence to back up this allegation.Terrible!

 Did Trump’s Former Campaign Manager Have People Killed? His Daughters Say He Did,"In mid-August just last year, Paul Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign after revelations that he was involved in protests organized by the pro-Russian Party of Regions against US Marines deployed to that country for a training exercise in 2006. According to a ledger reviewed by Ukraine s national Anti-Corruption Bureau, Manafort s name appeared in receipt of more than $12.7 million in cash payments over five years from disgraced Ukranian President Viktor Yanukovych. And that is just the short list of Manafort s transgressions.An investigation has just been requested by a Ukranian human rights lawyer over what appears to be text messages between Manfort s daughters. In those messages, the daughters suggest that their father had a hand in the bloody mass killings carried out by Ukraine security forces in 2014, the Daily News reports.Speaking of leaks: Last month, an anonymous hacker website published roughly 300,000 text messages that were supposedly sent between Manafort s daughters, Andrea and Jessica, and the accusations in the apparent conversations are harsh. You know he has killed people in Ukraine? Knowingly,  Andrea Manafort appears to have written to her sister via text in March 2015. That was in reference to their Trump-connected father s alleged role in the February 2014 police shootings in Kiev that killed over 100 pro-Western protesters in the weeks leading up to Yanukovych s escape from his country.Andrea Manafort reportedly wrote in another text to her sister that their father was behind the  strategy  that Yanukovych implemented in order to have his security forces kill dozens of protesters in Kiev s Independence Square. Do you know whose strategy that was to cause that, to send those people out and get them slaughtered,  Andrea Manafort allegedly wrote to her sister, referring to their father. He has no moral or legal compass,  she added.Manafort has long and deep ties to pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Yanukovych is closely connected to Russian leader Vladimir Putin. After he was ousted in 2014, he has been hiding in Russia after fleeing from his home country where he remains wanted on charges of high treason.According to experts, Manafort was invited in an unofficial capacity to consult on Yanukovych s first presidential campaign in December 2004, in the days of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine. During the presidential campaign, Manafort said he s known Trump for 30 years.I m sure Thanksgiving dinner this year will be fun at the Manafort home.Image via screen capture",News,11-Mar-17
 Highest Canadian Court CONFIRMS Trump Scammed Investors (DETAILS),"Donald Trump, the businessman who conservatives thought would be an ideal choice to become president of the most powerful country in the world, has scammed a lot of people along the way. As president-elect, Trump had to fork over $25 million to settle three lawsuits over his now-defunct Trump University and after he was sworn in, lawsuits are still coming in.The newest lawsuit alleges that the former reality show star and a real estate development firm misled investors, and that has now been upheld by Canada s highest court.The Independent reports:Sarbjit Singh and Se Na Lee alleged they were sold units in Toronto s, Trump International Hotel, under false pretenses.The pair claimed they were misled to believe their investments would see returns ranging from 7.7 per cent to 20.9 per cent. Instead, they said they lost a combined C$1.2m ( 732,810).Instead of the promised returns, the two investors lost a combined $1.2 million, according to the decision by the Ontario Court of Appeal last year, which sided with the plaintiffs in their case against Trump, Talon International Development and former executives of that firm.The Supreme Court of Canada backed that decision which upheld the lower court s ruling and decided it will not hear an appeal from the defendants.Justice Paul Rouleau wrote in a document outlining the case that,  neither Mr Singh nor Mrs Lee were sophisticated investors, in real estate or otherwise  and  both had to borrow heavily from family to finance their purchases .Justice Rouleaus continued to write that the  cornerstone  of the plaintiffs  claims was a document that was presented to each of them outlining the  estimated return on investment .Rouleau stated that  as it turned out, the estimates bore no relation to financial reality. The motions judge found as a fact that the estimates were  deceptive documents  and  replete with misrepresentations of commission, of omission, and of half-truth .The Ontario Court of Appeal ruled last October in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering that the sale of the unit must be rescinded for Singh and damages must be paid to Lee for  negligent misrepresentation. That order stands. With Trump University, promises were made and not kept. There was no  education  at the alleged university. It was a scam. People lost tens of thousands of dollars, most of them thinking that if Trump s name was tied to it, then it s a worthwhile investment. That s sort of what conservatives thought when they voted Trump into power on election day. Trump is plagued with scandals but yeah, he s a businessman, they said. Meanwhile, he s profiting greatly from his presidency.Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,11-Mar-17
 Trump Appointee Didn’t Last Two Months Before Being Fired For Calling For Muslim Genocide,"That didn t take long.One of Trump s oldest campaign backers was hooked up with a job he was blatantly not qualified for and seemingly had no interest in. Just two months later, he has already been fired for being a racist nutjob. Trump only hires  the best. According to reports first covered by Buzzfeed, Trump s associate Sid Bowdidge worked as a massage therapist before riding Trump s coattails to a gig at the Department of Energy.According to two employees at the nuclear weapons agency, who asked to remain anonymous, Sid Bowdidge, 60, began working at the department following President Trump s inauguration. An internal department database identified the New Hampshire Trump campaign worker as  assistant to the secretary,  a nebulous title given to political appointees at varied levels of responsibility.The move from back rubs to working on nuclear weapons policy was already a scandal, but Bowdidge refused to lie low. On his social media accounts, the man had routinely posted about desiring to see all Muslims  exterminated. Bowdidge is among a growing list of people who got cushy government jobs based on their loyalty to Donald Trump and not to their qualifications or temperment. Many of Trump s appointees   even for positions of extreme national importance   were unvetted. In the worst example, Trump s National Security Advisor was actively working as a  foreign agent  of the Turkish government at the time he was hired. At various times Trump has claimed he knew about it and was totally cool with it and that he didn t know about it. It s not clear which is worse: to be corrupt or incompetent and Trump may very well be both.An honest and competent administration, for instance, would have seen Bowdidge s insane tweets and immediately disqualified him. Trump hired him without even checking.Bowdidge also illustrates the caliber of person attracted to Trump. Since 2015, he has been one of Trump s fiercest supporters, even going on television to defend the former reality tv star from Republican and Democratic opposition. From his tweets, Bowdidge is a xenophobe who believes that President Obama was a secret Muslim.Again and again people in Trump s orbit are exposed as similarly vile and pathetic. He has been endorsed by KKK leader David Duke and is beloved by white nationalist website Breitbart. Several of his most prominent advisors are birthers. His former campaign manager resigned after covering up his ties to Russia. He lost his nominee for communications director to an infidelity scandal. He lost one of his campaign surrogates to the exact same infidelity scandal.It s difficult to put into words just how unqualified this administration is. It s rotten to the very core. Or as MSNBC s Chris Hayes summed up this particularly sad twist:Just to recap: the Trump admin hired & placed in DOE,a person w 1) no relevant experience 2) who called for all Muslims to be exterminated  Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) March 11, 2017Featured image via Facebook/New York Daily News",News,11-Mar-17
 Muhammad Ali Jr. Detained AGAIN At Airport Right After Testifying About First Detention,"One day after he testified about being stopped by immigration officials under Donald Trump s Muslim ban, the son of boxing legend Muhammad Ali was detained by immigration officials again   this time on a domestic flight.Muhammad Ali Jr. traveled to Washington on Wednesday to testify about the first time he was detained on his way back from a Black History Month speech he gave with his mother in Jamaica. Ali Jr. was initially detained at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on February 7 and questioned for two hours, with officials grilling him with ever-important questions like  Are you a Muslim  and  where did you get your name.  This time, the boxer s son didn t even make it to Florida.While attempting to board a flight home in a Washington-area airport, the TSA immediately took issue with his identification:When Mr. Ali, whose father died last year, arrived at Reagan National Airport in Washington on Friday for a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., he gave his Illinois identification card to a JetBlue agent to get his boarding pass, said his lawyer, Chris Mancini, who was traveling with him and witnessed the episode. Almost immediately, Mr. Ali was told that there was a problem and that the agent needed to call the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Mancini said.Mr. Ali, 44, was asked his date of birth, where he was born and his Social Security number, Mr. Mancini said. After answering the questions, he was told that his Illinois-issued identification card, which expires in 2019 but is not a driver s license, was invalid for flying. The same state ID from Illinois that he traveled to Washington on was rejected,  Mr. Mancini said in an interview on Friday night. Mr. Ali then produced his United States passport, which was accepted, and went through security and boarded the flight with his mother, Khalilah Camacho-Ali, the second wife of Muhammad Ali, and Mr. Mancini.Mr. Mancini said that the episode lasted between 20 and 25 minutes.  This whole thing smacks of some sort of retaliation for his testimony,  he said.The TSA, as is typical, absolved itself of all wrongdoing . Upon arriving at the airline check-in counter, a call was made to confirm Mr. Ali s identity with T.S.A. officials,  the agency says.  When Mr. Ali arrived at the checkpoint, his large jewelry alarmed the checkpoint scanner. He received a targeted pat-down in the area of his jewelry to clear the alarm and was cleared to catch his flight. This is now the second time over the course of two separate Muslim bans in which a well-known figure was singled out seemingly for no better reason than his name. This does not keep America safe   it makes everyday Americans afraid to travel if their skin is too dark or if they might appear too  Muslimy  to the unwashed bigots who regularly staff TSA checkpoints across the nation.If this is what America looks like when it s  Great Again,  then maybe we should stop. Let s not be so great. Our country can t handle it.Featured image via Getty Images (Mandel Ngan)",News,11-Mar-17
 WATCH: GOP Rep. Steve King Just Dropped A BOMBSHELL Admission About Trump’s Wiretapping Claims,"Oh, the wiretapping scandal. Or it would be a scandal if it were true. Trump hasn t produced any hard evidence of being tapped anywhere, but Republicans have jumped on the series of tweets in which he accused President Obama of tapping him as though it s concrete fact. Enter Rep. Steve King, who licks Trump s boots. He appeared on MSNBC last night to discuss Trump and his wiretapping nonsense.And he flat-out admitted that the GOP doesn t have any facts proving that Trump was wiretapped. Literally. He said (with a smile, of all things): We actually don t have any facts to work with on this. What we got are opinions. We got opinions from the intelligence community, from Clapper, from Brennan and others. He went on to say that he gets to hear the opinions of the intelligence community, but said again that they don t have any facts. That does not, however, change his belief that both Michael Flynn and Trump were wiretapped. He seems to think that the evidence is there, the intelligence is there, he just can t see it because it s sensitive.Or something.How much longer is this charade about wiretaps going to go on before they re forced to admit that they either never happened, or happened with good reason?

 GOP Rep. Just Achieved The IMPOSSIBLE By Outdoing Trump’s Hypocrisy On February Jobs Report,"Trump continued to claim credit for things with which he had little to do when February s jobs report came out earlier today, and Sean Spicer even defended him to a press that wanted to know why jobs reports are suddenly authentic, when they were all fake under Obama. But the hypocrisy doesn t end there, apparently. Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, issued his own statement on the jobs report, and in doing so, he brought Republican hypocrisy to a whole new level.The February 2016 jobs report, which, of course, came out under Obama, showed 242,000 new jobs. Brady said: While it s good news that more Americans have joined the labor force, it s disappointing to see so little growth in full time work and wages. One year later, we have a jobs report that says 238,000 new jobs were created in February. Brady said: This is a great report. The fact that hundreds of thousands more people found new jobs last month is a good sign that our economy is moving in the right direction. Isn t 238,000 less than 242,000? Or is there some kind of new math of which we aren t yet aware? Really, partisan games and fuzzy math are the only explanation for Brady s saying he s very pleased about last month s jobs report   it s obviously because there s a Republican in the White House and Brady wants to kiss his ass.It also showcases Republicans  insistence on opposing everything that Obama ever did.Brady should have thought this out a little better. There s no way to spin the difference between the two statements as anything other than sheer GOP hypocrisy.Take a look at both full statements below:Kevin Brady on the February 2016 job report v.

 Elijah Cummings Warned Mike Pence That Michael Flynn Was Lobbying For Turkey MONTHS Ago,"Donald Trump swears he had no idea that former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had lobbied for Turkish interests. None at all. Mike Pence says he was also clueless that Flynn had basically been a foreign agent. Hearing that story today was the first I d heard of it,  Pence told Fox News  Bret Baier on Thursday night.Now, this may come as a shock to you, but they lied. I know, I know. Who d of thought something said by the Trump administration would turn out to be a steaming load of crap. (Insert eye roll here.)Business Insider reports that  Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent sent Pence a letter on November 18 requesting more information about the potential conflicts of interest posed by Flynn s lobbying work. Recent news reports have revealed that Lt. Gen. Flynn was receiving classified briefings during the presidential campaign while his consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, Inc., was being paid to lobby the U.S. Government on behalf of a foreign government s interests,  Cummings wrote. Lt. Gen. Flynn s General Counsel and Principal, Robert Kelley, confirmed that they were hired by a foreign company to lobby for Turkish interests, stating:  They want to keep posted on what we all want to be informed of: the present situation, the transition between President Obama and President-Elect Trump.  When asked whether the firm had been hired because of Lt. Gen. Flynn s close ties to President-elect Trump, Mr. Kelley responded,  I hope so.' Between August and November of last year, Flynn s consulting firm was hired by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin to lobby the U.S. government for the extradition of  Fetullah Gulen   a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania who Erdogan believes is responsible for planning last year s attempted coup and generally fomenting dissent inside Turkey. Flynn resigned as Trump s national security adviser after he was busted in shady talks with Russia. He claims he acted alone and it was all harmless, but that seems unlikely to anybody wth even the tiniest shred of common sense. Now, he is at the center of yet another scandal with foreign powers.Cummings said that if Pence had listened to him months ago the administration might have been able to avoid the problems that have occurred with Lt. General Flynn. In addition to being in the press, I warned the Vice President directly three months ago about the conflicts created by Lt. General Flynn s company lobbying on behalf of Turkish interests,  Cummings said. If the Vice President had heeded my warnings, it s clear now he could have prevented the problems that occurred with Lt. General Flynn. Republicans in Congress are doing a disservice to the White House and our national security interests by not conducting rigorous and serious oversight of the administration, especially to help catch issues early and address them.

 NC Students Terrorize Minorities In Disgusting KKK Video; Their Punishment Is Shockingly Light,"Donald Trump s presidency has emboldened bigots everywhere. The latest hate incident comes courtesy of some despicable eighth grade students in North Carolina. In a stunningly racist video posted online and then removed, Leesville Road Middle School students can be seen and heard taunting minorities with the following: If you re in America, we don t accept n*****s,  as well as Jews, Arabs or Hispanics. Go back to the fields of Alabama, go back to the factories in Mississippi. You don t deserve freedom. One of the parents of a student at the school made school officials aware of the disgusting video. Wake Forest Schools District Spokeswoman Lisa Luten said of the video: It s disturbing. It s concerning, and it s something we re having conversations about whether a larger action needs to be taken. The school system had said that they could not reveal the details of punishments of specific students, but it was later learned that these racist little cretins only received a three-day suspension for what amounts to racialized terrorism. In contrast, a Black student got a 10-day suspension from a fighting incident, which came to a head after months of racially motivated bullying that he suffered at the hands of white students. When people became outraged, his suspension was reduced to five days.Tionda Holt, a parent at the school, says of the video: That video represents terrorism. That is inciting hate. Someone could have seen that video and gotten riled up. So, we see where this school system s priorities lie. A Black child cannot defend himself against racist torment, and gets punished much more severely than white students who are going after Black children just for existing. These people better get their act together. I hope the parents of the minority students targeted in this video sue the pants off of that school district and demand that the kids in this video be expelled.Watch the video below, via local newscast, ABC11:Featured image via video screen capture",News,10-Mar-17
 Reporter Calls Out The Racist Writer Trump Invited To Press Briefing – Press Room Erupts In Chaos,"He may work for Fox Radio but this man deserves a ton of respect for what he just did. At a breaking point with Trump s love affair with the racist blog  The Gateway Pundit,  Fox Radio s Jon Decker openly and vehemently criticized the White House for allowing the website, which panders in fake right-wing conspiracies and racist rhetoric, to attend daily press briefings alongside legitimate news sources.Decker didn t hold back. Pointing directly at The Gateway Pundit s Lucian Wintrich, Decker noted that he and his site  hate blacks, Jews, [and] Hispanics  and don t deserve to be in the room. It was a moment where a reporter finally had enough of Trump s normalization of racism, white Nationalism, and xenophobic outlets like Gateway Pundit and Breitbart.The site s founder, Jim Hoft, is frequently referred to as  the stupidest man on the Internet  for his daily parade of false and idiotic coverage of politics. He has repeatedly ran stories that fail to hold up to even the most basic scrutiny and often deals in wild conspiracies. Trump may like them because they relentlessly suck up to him, but they are despicable liars who deal in misinformation and hate.After Decker called Wintrich out, chaos ensued:Fox News Radio John Decker just loudly told everyone in briefing room that Gateway Pundit is here ""they hate blacks, Jews, Hispanics."" Wild  Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) March 10, 2017He was speaking to Lucian Wintrich. He said it twice, pointing to him, so everyone knew who he was. https://t.co/42njWQQ0fX  Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) March 10, 2017Needless to say, Wintrich saw things differently. On Twitter, he whined that he was  assaulted  by Decker. Apparently being called a racist is tantamount to a sucker punch for the poor conspiracy theorist. He also (hilariously) misspelled the word  assault  several times, again highlighting the caliber of writer Trump personally gave a seat in the press briefing room.Jon Decker asulted me at today's briefing. @FoxNews   is this behavior something you tolerate over there? He's sick .https://t.co/gzZhhIzOMD pic.twitter.com/ThppoHpRQw  Lucian B. Wintrich (@lucianwintrich) March 10, 2017John Decker also asulted me, pushing me in the break room & then grabbing my arm in the briefing room while shouting that I'm a nazi. https://t.co/RiVM1yYCJv  Lucian B. Wintrich (@lucianwintrich) March 10, 2017Wintrich also said he would be pressing charges against Decker for  assult  and also for harassment   ironic because Trump s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski once claimed it was no big deal when he yanked the arm of a female reporter who had dared to ask Trump a question as he walked out of a rally.In a statement, Decker pointed out that at no point did he  assault  Wintrich, who appears to be lying. Earlier today I had a conversation with a representative from the online publication Gateway Pundit.  The conversation was straightforward and direct. I also informed the full White House pool that this representative was present in the Briefing Room. At no time did I accost or assault this individual. More than a dozen witnesses will attest to this fact. For Trump to be stopped, reporters as well as ordinary citizens need to stand up to the normalization of his descent into racism and xenophobia. Inviting a fear-mongering, disreputable smear merchant like The Gateway Pundit into the White House shows a level of disrespect for the American people that transcends politics. Kudos to Decker for standing up and loudly saying that it s not okay.Featured image via Twitter",News,10-Mar-17

Though Stone quickly deleted the tweet, this raises some serious questions about the links between the Trump campaign and Russian propaganda outlet Wikileaks, who released hacked documents all through the campaign that were intended to help The Donald defeat Hillary Clinton. Wikileaks, of course, recently released information meant to discredit the CIA   a group Trump has been attacking.

 Spicer Giggles Like An Idiot After Admitting Trump Only Believes News When It Favors Him (VIDEO),"In a deeply disturbing moment during Press Secretary Sean Spicer s latest bonkers press briefing, he read verbatim a quote given to him by Trump that admitted the sitting President of the United States only believes facts when they make him look good. Everything else is  fake news. Spicer was asked during the briefing about the latest jobs report which showed America gaining a very healthy number of jobs. (There is no evidence to suggest this is due to Donald Trump, and in fact, it merely fits with the pattern of unrelenting job growth that came to define Obama s presidency. Trump has thus far done little to help the economy and nothing to help middle class workers, again suggesting this economic growth isn t the result of his presidency but merely his good fortune for having inherited a booming economy from his Democratic predecessor.)Despite the fact that there is little evidence of Trump s influence, his administration has been taking victory laps over the economic news. A reporter correctly noted that it s a bit odd that Trump would be so willing to trust the jobs report this time when he has previously gone on record to suggest that jobs reports under Obama were fabricated and false   a claim which, in 2015, earned him a  pants on fire  Politifact rating. Why the sudden change?The answer is so obvious that even Trump had no problem admitting it: He only believes the news when it benefits him. They may have been phony in the past, but it s very real now. Q: Trump has said jobs rpts are ""phony"", what about now?SPICER: ""They may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now."" via @MSNBC pic.twitter.com/PDt1Q8hrbp  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) March 10, 2017Rather than find that mindset pathological and terrifying, Spicer thought it was hilarious. Even more troubling, the reporters in the room burst into laughter too. Everyone laughing should be ashamed. It wasn t a joke. Trump is signaling the fact that his administration will be run on the premise that he defines what is  real  and what is  fake.  If it s pro-Trump, it s legitimate. If it s inconvenient, it s  fake news  created by the  Deep State  and the  liberal media  out to get him.That s the kind of paranoid delusions that quickly spiral into fascism. And Spicer is giggling about it.Featured image via Twitter",News,10-Mar-17
 WATCH: 2 GOP Reps. Are COMPLETELY Stumped Over How Many Constituents They’ll Hurt With Trumpcare,"The House s plan to repeal and replace the ACA is catching an awful lot of flak from Republicans and Democrats alike. Congressmen Steve King of Iowa, and Leonard Lance of New Jersey, appeared on MSNBC last night to discuss Trumpcare, and Chris Hayes grilled them about how it will affect their constituents. Neither was able to give him a real answer.Hayes asked King: How many people in your district are on the [ACA] exchanges, congressman? King s answer was the answer of someone who neither knows nor cares about his constituents   only his power and position: I don t know that number. You may have that in front of you, Chris, but I don t know that number. Hayes pressed Lance on that, too, and Lance tried to pass it off as a small number:  I would say roughly 5,000 or so, Chris. The thing is, those numbers are readily available, so there s zero excuse for them not knowing these answers.Furthermore, an interesting picture emerged last night   In Lance s New Jersey district, more than 20,000 people have insurance through the ACA, but roughly 38,000 will lose their coverage under the GOP s plan. In King s district, a little over 11,000 people have insurance through the ACA, but over 40,000 stand to lose their coverage if the GOP s plan passes.So they re going to yank coverage away from more people than those who obtained it under the ACA. WOW. As U.S. Representatives, it s these guys  job to know this kind of thing about their districts so that they can support or oppose bills based on who they represent. They ve failed miserably.But they d rather put party and ideology above their people. And King even believes that people have no right to health insurance, which means no right to healthcare (because without insurance, most of us can t afford medical care). He also believes that the best decisions are made by lawmakers closest to the people, so he s shucking his responsibility as a U.S. Representative.Both of them are sick for this.Watch both segments below: Featured image via screen capture from embedded videos",News,10-Mar-17
" Spicer Wears National Symbol Of ‘Distress’ On His Lapel During Briefing, Internet Has Field Day","Is Sean Spicer secretly sending America a cry for help? That s the question on everyone s mind as the beleaguered Press Secretary walked up to the podium and showed off his upside down American flag pin.Flying an upside down American flag is officially considered a  sign of distress  and the United States flag code says it should only be done  in instances of extreme danger to life or property.  Working for Trump and having to repeat his endless font of lies on a daily basis, certainly may qualify. He s been on the job for less than 3 months and already Spicer looks like he s slowly dying from the inside out. He s moody, he s paranoid, he seems unhappy   all the characteristics of a man who is straining under the pressure of having to defend Trump s nonsense with a straight face.Spicer s subtle signal of distress only added to the impression that his daily press briefings have turned into thinly-veiled hostage videos.

 WATCH: MSNBC Host HILARIOUSLY Informs Republican Men Why They Should Pay For Prenatal Care,"Republicans seriously need to pay attention in biology class.Because if they had, they would know that the reason women get pregnant in the first place is because of men.And that s why women need prenatal care to be covered by health insurance plans.But Republicans like Rep. John Shimkus think that men should not have to pay for prenatal care in their insurance plans, even though by doing exactly that they are protecting pregnant women and the fetuses they carry.During a committee hearing on Thursday, Shimkus openly whined about men having to pay for prenatal care and argued that insurance companies should only make women pay for it.Economist Austin Goolsbee expressed confusion over Shimkus  objection and proceeded to explain to him how insurance works. If you look at any insurance product, everyone pays in because there s a risk that a small number of people are going to have a claim,  Goolsbee began.  So, there s a subsidy, if you want to call it that, from people who don t get in car accidents to people who do get in car accidents. That s the nature of insurance. Everyone is born, I think we can agree on that. The prenatal care is good for society, that we are covering prenatal care, that women can have babies in a healthy way, and to object that men shouldn t have to pay for things that are women s problems, young people shouldn t pay in for things that are old people s problems. Hopefully all the young people will be old people, eventually. As I say, that s how insurance markets work. I don t understand this objection. Indeed, that s how Social Security works. Each generation of workers basically subsidizes the retirement of workers who came before them. This way, senior citizens can retire and live comfortably while a younger person gets a job.Republicans can also look at prenatal care another way. If they are seriously going to force women to carry pregnancies to term, the least they can do is help make sure that the mother and fetus are healthy and getting the medical attention they need.The cost of prenatal care insurance would skyrocket if women were the only ones having to pay for it since the insurance pool would be smaller.MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle, who has three children, also chimed in by informing Republicans that women don t impregnate themselves. Congressman Shimkus, if you are watching, unlike Tom Price, I m not a doctor. But I will talk science for a moment. Though it is women who need that prenatal care, men are involved in the process that requires them to need prenatal care, FYI. Here s the video via YouTube:Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for complaining so much about women s healthcare. Their mothers, sisters, daughters, and wives must be embarrassed.Featured image via screenshot",News,10-Mar-17
" Sean Spicer Just Gave Trump Credit For Something Obama Did, White House DESPERATE (TWEET)","Donald Trump has basically built his life around doing nothing and taking credit for the accomplishments and work of others   and that definitely has not changed since he won the election and got into the White House. The crazy thing is, he continues to claim the successes of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized and trashed in the past.The GOP has undermined Obama s soaring track record for the past eight years. They ve trashed everything Obama improved from the economy to his employment record   and now, they re more than happy to take credit for his hard work. Earlier today, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer showed just how desperate and pathetic the White House is when he tweeted this horrible message: Great news for American workers: economy added 235,000 new jobs, unemployment rate drops to 4.7% in first report for @POTUS Trump. Trump hasn t even been in office for two full months. These numbers are NOT a reflection of his work! It s also worth nothing that those job numbers for February 2016 (237,000) are nearly identical to the ones in February 2015 (238,000). Clearly, this is Obama s doing   not Trump s. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, job gains have averaged 209,000 per month. Trump and his team are so delusional, they seriously think they can take credit for the job numbers in February, when they didn t even get into the White House until January 20th.Under Obama, America saw the longest consecutive job creation streak in 75 years  completely dismantling the GOP s assertion that he didn t do anything for the country and left it worse than what he started with. Despite the fact that data shows that Obama greatly improved our country, Trump has still promised the American people that he would  fix  our jobs.

 Chris Cuomo SHREDS Republican For Ignoring This One Really HORRIFYING Factor Of Trumpcare (VIDEO),"The Republican Party is trying its hardest to gloss over the fact that its new health care replacement is a disaster that is going to hurt the American people more than anything.At a time when it s been widely reported that Americans are overwhelmingly satisfied with their Obamacare and would like to keep it, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) went on CNN in an attempt to promote Trumpcare. Unfortunately, he didn t anticipate being taken to the woodshed by host Chris Cuomo.Cuomo pushed back on Jordan s agenda and absolutely refused to let him get away with praising the new Republican health care plan without acknowledging the fact that literally MILLIONS of Americans will lose their health insurance thanks to Trump and the GOP. Cuomo also railed against Jordan s vision, stating that a  free market  for health insurance has never been executed anywhere else in the world, because all other developed countries make sure their citizens have health coverage. Cuomo said: You use government as if it s a bad word in this context, but to be fair, there is no place that you ll find that has this kind of marketplace when it comes to health insurance. You re saying it like it s something that should be understood. It s never existed anywhere else that you can point to, and remember, you have to be okay with having less people having health insurance to get some people to have it cheaper. Jordan tried to say that he wanted all people to have better insurance,  but Cuomo saw right through his bullsh*t and promptly called him out: They will lose coverage. The way you re fixing it right now millions of people may lose their coverage, you need to own that. Jordan could barely come up with a response to that other than a pathetic promise that those who got their health coverage through Obamacare would eventually be transitioned into the new system.You can watch Cuomo rip Jordan apart below:Featured image is a screenshot",News,10-Mar-17
 WATCH: Rabid Trump Supporters Call For ‘Liberal Genocide’ At FRIGHTENING Arizona Rally,"If you still don t think Trump supporters aren t Nazis, just remember that liberals aren t the ones calling for genocide.During a  March for Trump  rally in Arizona last weekend, Real News Network s Dan Cohen went to Maricopa County to engage with the rallygoers, and what he heard should horrify every American across the country.The Trump supporters were heard chanting in favor of imprisoning Hillary Clinton, even though Clinton was cleared by the FBI and investigations by Republicans have gone nowhere. The chants were also despite the fact that Mike Pence used a private email to conduct public business and was hacked.So there were definitely a bunch of hypocrites at the Trump rally.But that s not all.When asked about Muslims in America, a couple of Trump supporters has strong racist feelings about them. If you don t like it here, go to Syria, go to someplace else,  one Trump supporter yelled.Another racist Trump supporter called for deporting them.  I don t want  em, as a veteran I don t want  em, let  em go back home,  the Trump supporter said.  If they ve got a problem, let Saudi Arabia take care of  em. The problem with Saudi Arabia is that it doesn t have the kind of religious freedom that we hold so dear. Just as there are different sects of Christianity, there are different sects of Islam. And not everyone is able to practice their religious beliefs freely in many nations in the Middle East.The replies from Trump supporters then took a scarier turn as attendees called for deporting Jews.The hate against Jews has apparently even spread to the children of right-wingers. For instance, this is what a 13-year-old said: If she is Jewish, she should go back to her country. Seriously.And then a Trump supporter called for imprisoning and committing genocide against liberals so that America can be a true conservative hell-hole. I just want to let them know that I can t wait for the liberal genocide to begin,  he said.  That s the way to make America great again. Liberals are destroying the country. So if Trump supporters had their way, freedom of religion would only apply to Christians, Anti-Semitism would sweep across the country, Muslims would be persecuted, and liberals would all be put in internment camps and killed in what would be a Holocaust in America.Here s the video via YouTube.The next time someone tells you it s wrong to compare Trump and his supporters to the Nazis, show them this.Featured Image: Jim Lo   Pool/Getty Images",News,10-Mar-17
 Chelsea Clinton HUMILIATES Republican For Whining About Prenatal Care Coverage,"The wives and mothers of these Republicans must be so embarrassed.During a House Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing on Thursday to discuss the GOP s destructive healthcare bill, which guts women s healthcare, Illinois Rep. John Shimkus had the audacity and the ignorance to whine about having to pay for prenatal care in his insurance plan and literally argued that men should not have to pay for such things. Why should men pay for it?  Shimkus demanded to know.  I m just   I   is that not correct? Should they? Shimkus then proceeded to complain because insurance companies do not provide specific plans designed around each every person s individual needs and wants.Democratic Rep. Mike Doyle fired back by informing Shimkus that no insurance company in the world would do that because it s not as efficient and more complicated than what they do right now.But Shimkus does not appear to understand that prenatal care is important to keep fetuses and expecting mothers healthy throughout a pregnancy. Seriously, he must have a sister or mother or wife. Would he expected them to pay for their own prenatal care or would he have manned up and paid the extra few dollars every month to make sure they deliver a healthy child safely?If Republicans are serious about women carrying pregnancies to term than he should have absolutely no problem with having to pay a little extra for a vital healthcare service that pregnant women need.But this is the hypocrisy of Republicans. They want to force women to give birth but they don t want to do anything to help pregnant women take care of the fetus. They certainly don t give a damn about the child after it is born.Of course, Chelsea Clinton had an excellent point on Twitter in response to Shimkus.With all due respect, where do these men (all men?) think they came from? https://t.co/JG1IaMUEi0  Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) March 10, 2017Indeed. The way Republicans like Shimkus are acting it makes one wonder if their mothers had sufficient prenatal care.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,10-Mar-17
" REPORT: Clueless Trump ‘Unaware’ Top Adviser Was ‘Foreign Agent,’ Says White House","It looks like alleged president Donald Trump did not apply extreme vetting to his own cabinet picks, most especially one as important as National security adviser.According to White House press secretary Sean Spicer, Michael Flynn was working as a  foreign agent  when Trump gave him the job and the amateur president was totally unaware of this. When Spicer was asked by reporters at his press briefing on Thursday about the explosive new revelations about Flynn, he said, I don t believe that was known. Flynn had been working to further the interests of the government of Turkey before Trump appointed him, the White House said.To borrow a quote from Joe Biden, this is a big fucking deal:The comments came two days after Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., filed paperwork with the Justice Department formally identifying him as a foreign agent and acknowledging that his work for a company owned by a Turkish businessman could have aided Turkey s government. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday called the action  an affirmation of the president s decision to ask General Flynn to resign. Not so fast, Mr. Vice-President. After Flynn resigned, Trump said that the former aide was subjected to  criminal  leaks in the  fake media.  Trump went on to describe Flynn as a  wonderful  man and added,  I think it s really a sad thing he was treated so badly. A flow of intelligence leaks revealed that Flynn has secretly discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn then tried to cover it up and that ultimately led to his resignation.And on Wednesday, things got worse for Flynn. From September to November of 2016, Flynn was working as a top adviser to Trump s presidential campaign while lobbying for a firm linked to the Turkish government. For that, Flynn earned $530,000. Just two days ago, Flynn and his company Flynn Intel Group Inc, filed retroactive documents with the Department of Justice to register as a foreign agent.When Spicer was asked whether Trump would still have hired Flynn as his national security adviser if he had known he had been working as a foreign agent, he said, I don t know   That s a hypothetical. I don t know what was discussed prior to the appointment in terms of his background, his r sum , his client base. From what I ve read, he has filed appropriate forms with the Department of Justice; ask them and subsequently him if you have any questions about the filing,  Spicer continued.Spicer added that he was unaware of whether Flynn was involved in any discussions about foreign policy regarding Turkey.  I don t know. I don t have anything on that,  he added.Spicer is unaware of whether his boss would still have hired Flynn if he had known that he was working as a foreign agent. You can t make this stuff up.We re going to have to build a wall around the White House until we figure out what s going on.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,10-Mar-17
 Hannity Claims CIA Framed Trump And Russia While Hacking DNC For Obama And Gets FRIED (TWEETS),"On Thursday, Fox News hack and Donald Trump testicle-buffer Sean Hannity decided to use the new WikiLeaks release to formulate his most ridiculous defense of Trump s connections to Russia yet   they don t exist, and the CIA did it all.According to Hannity, Vladimir Putin s goons didn t, as is confirmed by 17 intelligence agencies, hack the DNC and the DNCC in an effort to help Donald Trump win. The CIA did it so they could frame Vladimir Putin and Trump. Is it possible, likely or can you confirm instances where the CIA used Malware to  Attribute  cyberattacks to other nations?

 Doctors Can Lie To Pregnant Women If This Republican Gets His Way; Already PASSED Committee,"Republicans nationwide seem to want to get rid of regulations on just about everything   guns, corporations, environmental protections, etc., but when it comes to women, they can t regulate fast enough.There is currently a state bill in Texas that just passed through the Senate committee on State Affairs unanimously (8-0) that will allow doctors to lie to women about anything wrong with their baby. Not only that, it prevents parents from being allowed to sue.According to the Dallas Voice: SB25   which would allow doctors to withhold information from pregnant women about the status of their fetus and then, if the child were born with a deformity or disability, prevent the parents from suing the doctor for withholding the information   has passed out of the Senate Committee on State Affairs on an 8-0 vote and is headed to the full Senate. The man behind SB 25? State Sen. Brandon Creighton (R- Conroe).senate.texas.govCreighton is described  as a genuine defender of conservative values. He has relentlessly hammered excessive taxation, pursued  loser pays  tort reform, passed drug testing for unemployment benefits, stood up for Texas  10th Amendment rights and effectively blocked Obamacare s Medicaid expansion.  So, really, he s an a**hole on pretty much every level. He hates the poor, hates women, and hates people being able to sue companies when something happens to them because of a product or service.When it comes to SB 25, he says: Senate Bill 25 will send a message that Texas does not believe that a life, in and of itself, is an injury in which parents need a damage payment. He thinks doctors should be able to keep pertinent information about a baby in the womb from the parents and that doctor should be protected for doing so. That s messed up on so many levels. It isn t pro-life, it s pro-birth and anti-freedom, and seems pretty damn immoral. It s a bill to prevent abortion by holding back information. The fact that it s already passed the Senate Committee 8-0 is even more mortifying.According to the Dallas Voice: Blake Rocap, legislative director for NARAL Pro-Choice Texas, said,  We shouldn t have to stand up and say that it shouldn t be policy for the state of Texas to excuse doctors from lying to their patients, and that is what this bill does. One would think that should be obvious, but Republicans are getting more outrageous and bold in their hatred of women by the day. Shame on them.Featured Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,9-Mar-17
 CNN Does NOT Hold Back; Completely Makes Fun Of Paul Ryan With The Rest Of America (IMAGE),"Now, it may not have been the intent of CNN to clearly make fun of Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and his pathetic attempt at describing the American Health Care Act (AHCA), better known as Trumpcare, but they definitely succeeded in doing so brilliantly.Ryan really seemed to want to impress people, so instead of doing a traditional Q&A, or laying things out pretty simply, he decided to do a skit. He literally rolled up his sleeves and did his best Steve Jobs impression with a low-tech powerpoint presentation and began to perform.CNN, clearly seeing this, and not letting the moment escape them, writes an Onion-style headline absolutely making fun of Ryan. They called his presentation a  TED talk    which, if you know what a TED talk is, makes the headline hilarious.Here s CNN s amazing shade thrown directly at Speaker Ryan s face:TwitterThen, to top off the amazing shade of the title with even more shade, this is the description of Ryan s shenanigans as written in the article: Forgoing the traditional give-and-take with reporters, Ryan launched at TED talk-style presentation. With his shirtsleeves rolled up and wearing a wireless microphone that allowed him to move around, the speaker rattled off a stream of facts and figures and clicked through PowerPoint slides. Then later: Ryan sprinkled his lecture with personal anecdotes about his three children all needing tonsillectomies and how his family dealt with multiple doctors and insurance companies. The speaker revealed he had Lasik surgery to improve his vision. If Paul Ryan wants us to take him seriously, then he should start by actually putting together something that we can take seriously, and this sure as hell wasn t it.Here s how everyone else is also making proper fun of Ryan:""And while the software library is somewhat limited, the new Zelda alone makes Nintendo Switch a must-have.

" Trump Just Did Something REALLY Weird On Twitter, And It Makes Him Look EXTREMELY Shady (IMAGE)","Donald Trump really doesn t make sticky situations any better for himself.Trump s entanglements with Russia continue to be a growing story, and a more recent piece to this puzzle came into play as Trump s Attorney General Jeff Sessions was accused of perjury over his communications with Russia. But if Trump was somehow trying to clean up his image and maintain a low profile, the fact that he  liked  a tweet about Senator Al Franken accusing Sessions of perjury certainly isn t going to help:The fact that Trump would publicly  like  a story about one of his biggest scandals only proves how insane he is. Every part of the Fox News story that Trump is calling attention to is negative, and portrays Sessions as someone who lied under oath because all of his arguments were so weak. And that s not all  the story shows that there was a THIRD time Sessions made contact with Russia, when before only two had been reported.To make this even more bizarre, Trump decided to like this story on the very day a poll was released that revealed most Americans were in agreement that Sessions lied under oath and should resign.Either Trump really thinks he s going to get away with all of this no matter how bold he is, or he s really that stupid. Considering that these actions are coming from the same man that bragged about how he could go out on a popular New York street and shoot someone without losing any votes, he really just might be that confident that he is going to skate by all of these accusations and investigations. Trump has never been one for subtlety, and he probably enjoys pushing the envelope and seeing what he can actually get away with. He needs to stop making fools out of the American people, and he must be held accountable for his actions.",News,9-Mar-17
" Mitch McConnell HUMILIATES Trump, Gives Him A BRUTAL Reality Check On Border Wall (VIDEO)","Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might just find himself the next target of one of Donald Trump s temper tantrums on Twitter.Earlier today during a Politico Playbook event, McConnell basically threw Trump under the bus and humiliated him in front of everyone when he very bluntly said that Mexico would NOT be paying for Trump s idiotic, ineffective border wall   a statement that greatly contradicts everything that Trump promised during his presidential campaign.When McConnell was questioned about Trump s wall, McConnell first tried to give a diplomatic answer and said, there are some places along the border where that s probably not the best way to secure the border.  However, when he was further pressed to see if he felt Mexico would pay for the wall, McConnell dropped all niceties and put his thoughts very bluntly. He smirked and said: Uh, no. McConnell and everyone in the room then shared a laugh, all at Trump s expense.You can watch McConnell poke fun at Trump below: For a leading Republican like McConnell to embarrass the Republican Party s leader and sitting POTUS like this is certainly surprising, and it only proves just how few people actually believe Trump is competent enough for this role and will be able to deliver his promises to the American people.Already, we ve seen Trump walk back several of his major campaign promises, one of them being this Mexico border wall. Mexico s leaders have already repeatedly stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall, and Trump has had to cover it up and lie to the American people and say that first taxpayers will pay for the wall, only to be reimbursed by Mexico at a later date   which Mexico has not agreed to. McConnell s comments show that no one   not even the GOP   believes Trump anymore.Featured image via Drew Angerer / Getty Images",News,9-Mar-17
 There Are Already Four Ways Trump Could Be Impeached — Here Are The Details,"Former Clinton Labor Secretary and current Berkeley economics professor Robert Reich has long been one of Donald Trump s most vocal opponents and he thinks Trump could be done. On Thursday, he took to Twitter to outline four ways in which Trump could already be impeached and he might just be beginning, at least according to Reich.Reich, along with others, is saying that Trump s unsubstantiated claims that Obama wiretapped him are enough to impeach him.Reich also cited Article 1 Section 9 of the Constitution, which  forbids government officials from taking things of value from foreign governments. Trump seems to be looking at the Office of the Presidency as just another way to increase his personal wealth. He has refused to divest himself from his businesses, even while putting his children in charge. Even before he was inaugurated, foreign diplomats began to see spending money at Trump hotels as a way to cozy up to the new American leader. Almost as soon as he took office, his Florida resort and  weekend White House,  Mar-A-Lago, doubled its initiation fee from $100,000 to a whopping $200,000. But the most egregious offense was announced on Wednesday, when the Associated Press announced that China s Trademark Office gave preliminary approval to 38 new Trump trademarks.The third way Trump could be impeached today, according to Reich, is his violation of the First Amendment, which  bars any law  respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'  Trump violated this with his Muslim ban, which singles out a religion.The fourth is also a violation of the First Amendment, which also bars  abridging the freedom of the press.  Trump consistently labels the media as  fake  and even as  the enemy.  They are shut out of press conferences and reporters are escorted out for daring to ask tough questions.While the evidence isn t yet completely in, it s looking more and more like the ties between Trump and Russia are treason, at least according to Reich, who says: Article III Section 3 of the Constitution defines  treason against the United States  as  adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.'  Reich argues that Trump s apparent collusion with Russians helped him win the election.By my count, there are now four grounds to impeach Trump. The fifth seems to be on its way. pic.twitter.com/PfAw0a0hfU  Robert Reich (@RBReich) March 9, 2017Reich isn t delusional enough to believe that impeachment will happen under the current GOP Congress. His goal is to flip the Congress in 2018, which means people have to stay engaged and stay aware. Of course, that s why Trump tries to delegitimize the media.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,9-Mar-17
 Sean Spicer Accidentally ADMITS Trump Lied About Obama Tapping His ‘Wires’,"Sean Spicer might be in a little bit of a trouble after an off-camera Wednesday press briefing. Though President* Trump and Spicer himself have been pushing The Donald s baseless conspiracy theory that President Obama tapped the  wires  at Trump Tower, Spicer accidentally admitted they were just making sh*t up. There is no reason that we should   that we have to think that the President is the target of any investigation whatsoever,  Spicy told reporters just minutes after he implied that he was unsure if the President was the  target of a counter-intelligence investigation. I think that s what we need to find out. There s obviously a lot of concern,  Spicer had said. But at the end of the briefing, he was handed a sheet of paper, from which he read his revised answer verbatim.The wiretapping allegations, clearly intended to distract from and detract from any ongoing investigations into Team Trump s connections to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, have become quite uncomfortable for Trump, who demanded that Congress waste time, resources, and effort looking into them, as just like everything else our alleged President says they are a lie   one that is quickly getting out of hand.Last Thursday, Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Sheldon White House (D-RI) sent a letter tp the Justice Department asking for any evidence of Trump s ridiculous claim: We request that the Department of Justice provide us copies of any warrant applications and court orders   redacted as necessary to protect intelligence sources and methods that may be compromised by disclosure, and to protect any ongoing investigations   related to wiretaps of President Trump, the Trump Campaign, or Trump Tower. All I can say is that the country needs an answer to this,  Graham told CNN.  The current President has accused the former President of basically wiretapping his campaign. Unfortunately, this is the norm for Donald Trump. Whenever things get too uncomfortably close to the truth, he starts a political forest fire that distracts the nation long enough for everyone to forget about it or at least to provide Trump sufficient time to figure out how to explain away whatever the current issue is.It is imperative that our elected officials stop falling for this and keep their eyes on what really matters   that we have a President whose staff both during the campaign and during his presidency was caught colluding with a hostile foreign power.Here s the video:Featured image via screengrab",News,9-Mar-17
 Trump Planning ‘Football Stadium Rallies’ In Red States To Push Trumpcare Through,"Amateur president Donald Trump loves Trumpcare, the GOP replacement for Obamacare even though everyone hates it. Conservative groups, liberals and hospitals are all opposed to Trumpcare. It benefits the wealthy while omitting the elderly and sick and if a health care plan doesn t help those who are not feeling well then what good is it? Well, if it helps to keep Republicans in power, then there s a chance that the sh*tty replacement plan will pass anyway. While most of Americans were sleeping, the House committee scored an initial triumph in their effort to scuttle former President Barack Obama s health care overhaul, using a pre-dawn vote, and while that took place, Congress members were literally giggling. That happened at 2:00 a.m.Meanwhile, Trump has warned Republicans that there will be an  electoral bloodbath  in 2018 if the bill isn t passed. Trump is so proud of the crappy health care plan that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway doesn t want Trump s name attached to it. They know it s that bad but eradicating former President Barack Obama s legacy is more important than the welfare of American citizens.Trump s newest move is to throw more rallies, just as one does after winning an election (wink wink). After the election, Trump went on a thank you tour, then instead of getting to work, the 70-year-old Twitter addicted ragey screamy guy held another rally in Florida.Jim Acosta, CNN s White House correspondent, tweeted,  Trump confident health care will pass House but for Senate he plans  football stadium rallies  in red states to prod vulnerable Dems.

" Two GOP Reps. Have An Alternate Healthcare Bill, And Its Name Will Make You Laugh Your A** Off","House Republicans (finally) unveiled their repeal-and-replace healthcare plan, much to the fury of all the people who will be hurt by the GOP s insistence on giving massive blow jobs to their corporate overlords. Some Republicans aren t behind it, but many are. And then there are some that have drafted their own bill, like Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas (not to be confused with embattled Attorney General, Jeff Sessions).He introduced his own healthcare legislation on March 1st, and he calls it the  World s Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2017.  Seriously. That s the actual name of the bill. This isn t from The Onion, or something that Snopes or Politifact are going to rate as false. Pete Sessions literally named it the  World s Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2017. While that sounds egotistical enough to be the same bill that the House unveiled earlier this week, it s not. Sessions also never meant it to compete with the AHCA, which is the Republicans  current plan with which to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Pete Sessions does support that bill and hopes it passes.His own bill, the  World s Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2017,  has similar provisions to the AHCA, because of course it does. It would eliminate the individual and employer mandates, expand health savings accounts (which he apparently thinks promotes accountability), turns the premium subsidies into tax credits that are absolute baloney, and so forth.So it s another version of Obamacare Lite, which Republicans like Rand Paul despise because the AHCA is not the full repeal that they promised the American people (but a full, clean repeal like Paul wants is impossible now).But that name   the one Sessions put on his own. Really? That s seriously something that Donald Trump would do. Despite the name, Sessions  spokesperson says he really believes in the GOP s plan, and believes that both are the greatest healthcare bills. His just has a more ridiculous name, and it s not the first time he s introduced it. He actually introduced  The World s Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2016  last year.Perhaps his next bill will be one to amend the AHCA to be called the  World s Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2018?  We need to pick our jaws up off the floor.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,9-Mar-17
" The Russia Scandal EXPLODED In December, Implicating Paul Ryan, And No One Noticed","Trump and his administration have been dogged by ongoing accusations and reports that they re in bed with Russia. But a huge part of the story got lost in the controversy over the presidential election, and it implicates the entire Republican Party. In addition to the DNC, Russia targeted the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and several Democratic House races with their cyberattack.The hackers are Guccifer 2.0, according to a December report in The New York Times, and they made public the names, cell phone numbers, email addresses and even personal addresses of the Democratic candidates they went after. But they didn t stop there   they also released batches upon batches of internal party documents, seemingly with the intent to influence the closest House races in the country.And how is Paul Ryan involved in any of this? The National Republican Campaign Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a superPAC that s tied to Ryan, both used stolen D.C.C.C. documents to mount an attack campaign against Joe Garcia, a Florida Democrat who lost a very competitive race with Carlos Curbelo who unseated Garcia in 2014.The illicit material was used in other states as well, including swing states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio and North Carolina; as well as in Illinois and New Mexico. Anywhere where Democratic candidates were in very tight races against their GOP opponents.Whether Paul Ryan knew about the CLF s use of material hacked by the Russians is anyone s guess. The point remains, though, that his own super-PAC used information that came courtesy of Russia, which means that Russia didn t just influence the presidential side of things   they influenced the Congressional side of things.And it s not like they had material that they genuinely thought was just flowing from some natural spigot. Several Republicans did refuse the chance to use the hacked documents in part because they knew it came  from a possible foreign source. The D.C.C.C. s chairman, Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, sent a letter to his counterpart at the N.R.C.C. when he first saw an ad that appeared to use the hacked documents: The N.R.C.C. s use of documents stolen by the Russians plays right into the hands of one of the United States  most dangerous adversaries. Put simply, if this action continues, the N.R.C.C. will be complicit in aiding the Russian government in its effort to influence American elections. And that s what s happened. Russia had its hands in far more than our presidential election and calls the results of every federal race in 2016 into serious question. The Republicans ran with the material, which does, in fact, make them complicit in Russia s meddling.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,8-Mar-17

They re the work of a street artist known as Plastic Jesus, who s previously focused most of his work on the entertainment industry. According to LAist, though, these signs are something different, and not just because they re political: We re seeing detention of travelers to the U.S. They have all the proper credentials, but they re being detained for the country they re coming from, as well as their race. I have a friend who was detained because her name was Lebanese. She was detained for a couple hours and was questioned. This was someone who has a visa. Lebanon isn t on Trump s list. It s normal for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to briefly question foreign nationals from everywhere before granting them admission to the country, and it s true that we don t know all the specific circumstances surrounding these detentions. However, the amount of hours-long detention for people who seem to otherwise check out (are traveling on the proper visa, have the rest of their travel documents and itineraries in order, etc.) is alarming.Not only are people being unnecessarily, and even wrongly, delayed prior to entering the U.S., but Trump is working to ramp up deportation, including increasing funding for  detention beds,  for immigrants awaiting deportation. To ramp up the deportation process the way Trump wants could eventually require camps, since detention centers aren t big enough, probably won t be made big enough, and deporting someone isn t as simple as picking them up and driving them across the border.The signs reference Executive Order 9066, which is the order FDR signed to create the Japanese internment camps we had during WWII. The idea of camps for immigrants, people who are prohibited from entering the U.S. due to Trump s new travel ban but can t be turned around immediately, and possibly more, is eerily evocative of that.There s some backlash, but when art gets political like this, there will always be backlash. The idea is to stir people up and make them take notice of the events unfolding around them.Featured image by John Moore via Getty Images",News,8-Mar-17
 Obama Just Gave The PERFECT Response To Donald Trump’s BS Wiretap Claim,"When former President George W. Bush left office, he remained quiet in regards to any criticism of Barack Obama. Sure, Dick Cheney didn t, but Obama s predecessor remained graceful in order to keep the peace. President Obama didn t attack Bush, either. Trump s unprecedented attack by a sitting president on the former occupant of the White House has caused a firestorm off attention after calling Obama sick  and suggested he should be criminally prosecuted for  wiretapping  him during the election campaign. Trump did not offer any proof and the White House is scrambling to defend his jaw-dropping claims which originated from the right-wing fake news site Breitbart, then was promptly circulated by fake news site Gateway Pundit.So what does Barack Obama think of the new conspiracy theory about him? Unlike Trump, Obama can take the heat with a simple eye roll and shrug it off. Obama didn t take to his Twitter account to unleash mean-girl tweets about Donald Trump.A source who spoke to NBC News said that former President Barack Obama  rolled his eyes  at Trump s unsubstantiated claims that he wiretapped Trump Tower toward the end of the 2016 election.This his how a real President reacts to a 70-year-old s Twitter tantrum:The source, who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity and is familiar with the president s thinking, said Obama believes the claims  undermine the integrity of the office of the president,  but don t undermine his own integrity, because  he didn t do it. The source added that Obama  is much more concerned by President Trump kicking people off their health insurance, not staffing the government, not being prepared for a crisis, rolling back regulations so that corporations can pollute the air and water and letting mentally unstable people buy guns with no problems whatsoever. He cares about all those things much more than what President Trump tweets at the TV each morning,  the source continued.The White House has stated that alleged president Donald Trump supports a congressional investigation into  whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016  as part of a larger investigation into the Russian hacking scandal.So, Obama is more concerned about our country s well-being than over some crotchety old man s rantings on Twitter even though Trump has again created another conspiracy about his predecessor.Seriously, Trump supporters, you never knew what you had until it was gone. Sort of like Obamacare which is being replaced by Trumpcare Karmacare.Photo by Zach Gibson/Getty Images.",News,8-Mar-17

" Sean Spicer F**ks Up, Accidentally Admits DEVASTATING Fact About TrumpCare (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s rollout of TrumpCare is already crashing and burning (just like everything he tries to do)   and his White House Press Secretary certainly isn t helping him. Earlier today, Sean Spicer tried to address the questions surrounding the much-hated TrumpCare plan, and accidentally admitted that tons of people are going to lose their health care coverage because of it.Spicer basically said that it didn t matter how many people would be covered under the new horrible Obamacare replacement:You can watch Spicer f**k up in the video below:Spicer went off on Obamacare, incorrectly stating that people had cards under the Affordable Care Act, yet they were not receiving care. This is absolutely false, as Obamacare had measures put in place to guarantee that people would be covered by insurance companies   unlike TrumpCare, which doesn t have any of those regulations.So far, the GOP has fallen silent over how many people would be covered under their Obamacare replacement measure. They purposely avoided running TrumpCare past the Congressional Budget Office   a move that is being highly criticized for its lack of transparency. Leader Nancy Pelosi suggested that this secrecy was to prevent word getting out that millions of Americans will lose their coverage under the new plan. This looks like yet another thing that Trump won t be able to deliver. Let s not forget that Trump promised again and again that his new health care plan would cover everyone. He once said: I am going to take care of everybody everybody s going to be taken care of, much better than they re taken care of now. Trump also promised America that he was so good at making deals that the government would basically pay for everyone s coverage:How do we go from everyone being covered to not being able to even say how many people were going to be covered   and trying to spin the issue to be about people not getting care? What Spicer is doing is trying to reframe Trump s campaign promises, because the White House knows they can t be delivered. TrumpCare is an abomination compared to Obamacare, and millions of Americans are going to suffer because of the GOP s incompetence.Featured image is a screenshot",News,8-Mar-17
" Trump To Gut Coast Guard, Airport Security, And FEMA To Fund Useless Border Wall","Donald Trump s obsession with building a massive expensive wall along the Mexican border is literally going to make America less secure.Despite claiming that he will beat back terrorism and keep Americans safe, Trump is drafting a budget proposal that would cripple three of the nation s most critical agencies that do way more to help Americans than any wall will ever do.The cost of Trump s wall is projected to reach past $20 billion. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed that Mexico would pay for the wall, but it s clear now that American taxpayers will be footing the bill. And rather than create a new budget item, Trump is considering just cutting funding from existing national security and national emergency management agencies to use it to pay for the wall instead.On the chopping block includes the U.S. Coast Guard, a crucial branch of the military that patrols and secures our ports, coast lines, and waterways, defending them from potential terrorist attacks and rescuing people.This particular cut is fiercely opposed by Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter, who explained on CNN Wednesday why the Coast Guard is too important to slash. You have President Trump talking about security, criminal networks   that s what the Coast Guard does, literally!  Hunter said.  So how can the president talk about  stopping illegal immigration, illegal drugs, and criminal narco networks, and then say we re going to cut the military and cut the Coast Guard? The way you stop bad things from happening here is not directly on the border, necessarily. So this is nonsensical to me. But that s not all.According to the Washington Post,The proposal, drawn up by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also would slash the budget of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which provides disaster relief after hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters. The Coast Guard s $9.1 billion budget in 2017 would be cut 14 percent to about $7.8 billion, while the TSA and FEMA budgets would be reduced about 11 percent each to $4.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.In regards to the Transportation Security Administration, Trump plans to cut post-9/11 programs, which includes a program that trains airline crews how to deal with hijackers, a program that funds the use of special law enforcement teams that sweep transportation hubs for potential threats prior to and during major events like an inauguration, a program that gives local law enforcement more ability to patrol in and around airports, and a program that funds the use of special TSA agents who are trained to specifically detect people exhibiting odd behavior at check-points.In other words, programs that  have been considered a vital piece of airport security and for preventing a repetition of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackings So Trump is literally looking to sacrifice programs designed to prevent another 9/11 in order to build a wall that most experts consider useless in stopping immigration.Donald Trump is once again demonstrating that he cares more about himself than he does about the safety and security of the American people. The Coast Guard protects our coastal boarders from inside and outside threats. The TSA helps prevent another 9/11 attack from occurring on American soil. And FEMA responds to help Americans before, during, and after a disaster strikes. Gutting these agencies doesn t make America safer. It makes us more vulnerable and that appears to be exactly what Trumps wants.If it wasn t clear enough before, it definitely is now. Trump is the greatest threat to our national security.Featured image via Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images",News,8-Mar-17
 Trump Threatens Electoral ‘Bloodbath’ If Republicans Fail To Pass Obamacare Replacement (VIDEO),"House Republicans have released their version of Obamacare replacement and it s bad, very bad. There s also almost no chance it will pass. Trump loves the bill, though. He loves it so much that he warned Republicans would experience an electoral  bloodbath  in 2018 if they don t pass it.On Tuesday, Trump had a meeting with House Republicans in which he delivered the stern warning. He said he was behind the bill 100 percent, even though the bill hasn t been scored by the Congressional Budget Office. In other words, we don t know how much the bill will cost and how many people will be losing insurance, but, according to Trump, the House should just go ahead and pass it.Trump vowed to throw his full support behind the effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act during a meeting with House GOP leadership, saying he is  proud  to support a GOP-authored plan to replace Obamacare and told members behind closed doors that he would support it  100%,  according to sources in the room.But he warned lawmakers of the high-stakes nature of the effort, citing a potential electoral  bloodbath,  a member present said. He said he hopes members understand that,  the source said.Source: CNNHere s Trump s public statement:Trump could be right that there will be an electoral bloodbath in 2018, but not for the reason he says. Obamacare is suddenly very popular across the country and voters are standing up to their politicians demanding that if they make any improvements, it will be to provide better benefits, not fewer.It s gotten so bad for Republicans that many of them are refusing to face their constituents as they debate how to best get rid of people s life saving health insurance. Of course, they just blame President Obama, George Soros and the  fake news. Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,8-Mar-17
 Dan Rather Just Took Republicans To The Woodshed For Passing Horrible Healthcare Bill,"This is what legendary newsman Dan Rather thinks about Trumpcare, and it s an EPIC ass-kicking.On Monday, House Republicans officially passed a bill they dubiously refer to as the  American Healthcare Act, except that is neither American nor is it healthcare.Instead, this bill repeals the Affordable Care Act, which strips tens of millions of Americans of their health insurance coverage while raising the cost of care significantly. The bill does nothing to cover more people and does not improve healthcare one iota. Yet Trump has praised this piece of shit bill as  wonderful. Dan Rather disagrees and wrote a scathing post on Facebook calling out Republicans and Trump for screwing over the American people. For seven years we ve been hearing from Republicans about how horrible Obamacare was, and this was the best they could come up with?  Rather wrote.  A rush job that doesn t seem to have any new ideas or fix the core problems? It seems to prove the point that this was always about rhetoric and not about actually trying to make health insurance either cover more people or lower costs. Indeed, this has always been about tearing down the legacy of America s first black president. The Affordable Care Act was not perfect but did slow down the rising costs of healthcare while making the uninsured rate drop to all-time lows.Rather then slammed Donald Trump for breaking every promise he made on the campaign trail.The ball is firmly in the court of the GOP. They control the government, and President Trump made promises on the campaign trail about lower premiums, keeping your doctor, everyone staying insured, etc. Basically a version of healthcare that would be better told by Hans Christian Andersen   a fairy tale. And everyone with any sense on this issue knew it.Legislation isn t a campaign speech. It actually has to be made up of words that lead to law. And those words have to actually tell you something about who will win and who will lose. Who will be covered and how much it might cost. And now that we have a GOP plan, it is getting picked apart by politicians and interest groups on all sides. It is starting to look about as popular as ants at a picnic.In conclusion, Rather shamed Paul Ryan and Republicans for putting the hatred and racism of their rabid base over the health and lives of the millions of people who rely on the Affordable Care Act.So here we stand. And President Trump is swinging the full weight of his Administration behind the Ryan plan. Maybe that will be enough to arm twist skeptical Republicans. Or maybe this effort will fall apart in spectacular failure. Mr. Trump promised to replace and repeal Obamacare on day one. But the Affordable Care Act (yes to some out there, that is the same as Obamacare) is still the law of the land. And who knows how long that may last. It likely will be dramatic political theater. It s just a horrible shame that the stakes being toyed with are millions of Americans and their health insurance.Featured image via Matthew Eisman/Getty Images",News,8-Mar-17
 New GOP Bills Would Let Corporations Strip Away Our First Amendment Rights,"While we re focused on the ridiculous Donald Trump tweets or the equally ridiculous Obamacare replacement bill, Republicans are debating a bill that would put us at the total mercy of corporations, no matter what they do.Currently, there are a few bills in the House and in the Senate, which are different, but identical in one way: They both strip us of our right to free speech, and, well, they do both put to rest the idea that Republicans are for the  free market. There s H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act that Rep. Bob Goodlatte (VA) introduced in early February.It would place a slew of new restrictions on class action lawsuits, like barring judges from certifying a class action where the lawyer representing the plaintiffs is in anyway related to anyone in that plaintiff class. Not just familial relations either; if the attorney has any sort of working relationship with a class member outside of that particular lawsuit, the case would be shut down.Source: ConsumeristThink about that for a moment. While corporations might have in-house council or their usual team of lawyers to represent them, we, as consumers, would not be allowed to work with an attorney that anyone in the class action suit had worked with, or had known, before. Since most consumers don t have an army of attorneys at their disposal, this gives a serious advantage to the corporations.Other bills introduced in recent weeks by GOP lawmakers seek to limit more specific types of legal claims. One piece of legislation could make it more difficult for victims of asbestos to collect their claim by imposing new paperwork requirements on the trusts administering these funds. Another bill would preempt state medical malpractice laws and cap non-financial damages at $250,000.Democrats, thankfully, are attempting to expand consumer rights.One bill, by our current hero Al Franken (D-MN), would allow us to sue corporations instead of being forced into arbitration   typically with the arbiter chosen by the corporation.Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) has a similar bill, which would ensure that states follow state and federal laws.For example, Airbnb was recently able to compel arbitration in a lawsuit alleging violations of federal civil rights laws, and Wells Fargo is trying to sidestep a massive consumer fraud lawsuit by compelling the cases into arbitration. When Americans enter into agreements to obtain cellphone service, rent an apartment, or accept a new job, most are not made aware of the forced arbitration clauses that are tucked away in the legal fine print,  said Leahy.  But these dangerous provisions force us to abandon our Constitutional right to protect ourselves in court, and instead send hardworking Americans to face wealthy corporations behind closed-doors in private arbitration. While all of these binding arbitration and these restrictions on how complaints can be addressed are completely anti-consumer, the one that should be called a violation of our most basic rights to free speech are non-disclosure agreements, which even Republicans should object to. In fact, one Republican, former Fox host Gretchen Carlson, objects strongly, since she was a plaintiff in a sexual harassment suit against her former employer. Arbitration silences millions of other survivors who might have come forward if they knew they weren t alone,  said Carlson, who contends that this should not be a partisan issue:  Harassers come from all political parties. She s right and the party that favors the free market should agree. The only way a free market could even begin to work is if consumers have all the information that s available. By silencing consumers, we are not only violating the First Amendment rights, we are leaving it open for future consumers to be hurt in the exact same way.Silencing consumers in favor of corporations isn t exactly new, but it s a huge step toward fascism. Strengthening those laws aren t good for small businesses, and they are horrible for the consumer, and as with any fascist country, corporations are king.Featured image of Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,8-Mar-17
 WATCH: Trump Loves The GOP Healthcare Bill But Kellyanne Conway Doesn’t Want His Name On It,"If Trump isn t willing to attach his name to something, you know it must really be bad no matter how  wonderful  he says it is.On Monday, House Republicans passed what they dubiously refer to as the  American Healthcare Act,  which repeals the Affordable Care Act.The bill would strip healthcare from millions of Americans, including the millions who were able to access Medicaid coverage. The bill also defunds Planned Parenthood and sticks senior citizens with higher costs among a litany of other things that screw over the American people.On Tuesday, Donald Trump praised the bill on Twitter.Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster   is imploding fast!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2017Of course, the only reason why the Affordable Care Act is  imploding  is because Trump and Republicans have been sabotaging it.But as  wonderful  as Trump says the  Make America Sick Again  bill is, his propaganda minister Kellyanne Conway is desperate to make sure Trump s name is not attached to it.After being asked by Fox News host Bill Hemmer if it would be okay to call the bill  Trumpcare,  Conway was quick to reply that Trump s name should not be associated with it in such a way. It s the American Health Care Act, and I think it s aptly named that for this reason,  Conway said.  It wants to cover, it wants everyone to have access to coverage, and that is something that didn t happen under Obamacare  I ll call it Trumpcare if you want to, but I didn t hear President Trump say to any of us,  I want my name on that.  It s not about branding according to someone s name. This is serious business. Here s the video via YouTube:Gee, that didn t stop Republicans from branding the Affordable Care Act as  Obamacare,  even though the landmark healthcare law was  aptly named  because it actually made healthcare more accessible and affordable for millions of Americans.Trump s  American Healthcare Act  only strips millions of Americans of their healthcare coverage. It does nothing to give coverage to everyone. If Trump wants to cover all Americans he would push for universal healthcare, not a bill that takes healthcare away from millions, including people who voted for him.The real reason why Conway doesn t want Trump s name on the bill is because it s a bad bill that will harm a lot of people. In fact, it will likely lead to the deaths of many Americans.Trump and his Republican sycophants don t give a shit about all the people they are going to hurt by repealing the Affordable Care Act. Ad they certainly do not care about this country and its future. They only care about themselves.Featured image via screenshot",News,8-Mar-17
 WATCH: Republican Rep Tells Poor Americans To Use Emergency Room As Their Healthcare ‘Coverage’,"Can somebody tell this piece of shit congressman that the emergency room is is NOT healthcare coverage?On Tuesday, GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz told low-income Americans that if they want healthcare they should stop buying iPhones, even though an iPhone is ten times cheaper per year than the average health insurance premium. You know what, Americans have choices, and they ve got to make a choice,  Chaffetz said.  And so maybe, rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on, maybe they should invest in their own health care. A monthly payment plan for an iPhone is under $30 while health insurance costs over $200 a month. Far more than millions of Americans can afford, even if they didn t buy an iPhone. In fact, it would take approximately ten months to save up for just one month of health insurance coverage.And now another Republican lawmaker has an idea that is just as asinine and just as heartless, and it s one of the reasons why the Affordable Care Act was passed in the first place.Emergency room care has bankrupted many Americans over the years. That s because many people can t afford health insurance to pay for check-ups and annual physicals or get preventive care. So minor health issues become emergency health crises. The average price of a single emergency room visit is $2,168. And that means such visits can cost more than that, even if all you have is indigestion that causes chest pains.These costs can cripple people financially, and that s why the Affordable Care Act was passed, so that low income Americans would finally have access to affordable health insurance they can use to visit their doctors regularly.Republicans like North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, however, think emergency room care is perfect coverage.First, Meadows told CNN host Alisyn Camerota that he agrees with Chaffetz s remark about iPhones. Well, they re already making choices now for those kind of things,  Meadows said.  I ve talked to a number of people having to make choices between, you know, do they put food on the table or pay for the health care? Right, so repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean millions of Americans would have to once again choose between feeding themselves and their families or paying for healthcare.Then Meadows spewed a bunch of bullshit about how Republicans are going to cover more people at less cost. We re all in to help to make sure we get more people covered at less cost. And so that s a choice that I don t want any American to make. I certainly don t want my family to make. As we look at that health care coverage, and certainly health care in general, it s something we need to make sure it s something everybody has access to. Again, by repealing the Affordable Care Act, Republicans are stripping 30 million Americans of their healthcare and will actually make healthcare costs skyrocket after the law slowed down the rising costs by reducing the number of emergency room bills that hospitals usually have to eat because patients can t afford to pay.Furthermore, Meadows went on to claim that emergency room care is the same as having health insurance. Well, we ve got 318 million people. The goal is to allow access to all. There s a federal law right now that if you show up at a hospital, you get coverage, Alisyn. And so, it s a false narrative to suggest we have people who can t go in and get coverage. It s a federal law. Here s the video via YouTube:That law is there to guarantee that anyone who needs emergency care will not be turned away. It s not meant as an umbrella insurance coverage program and could never actually be one.If Republicans seriously believe the emergency room is a suitable substitute for universal healthcare then it is clear they don t care about the health of the American people at all.It should also be pointed out that Meadows and his family do not have to worry about choosing between food and healthcare because his healthcare is covered by the government and paid for by taxpayers.Basically, Republicans think it s okay for them to have government-provided healthcare, but everyone else should be forced to rely on overcrowded emergency rooms. It s time to change that, and we can start by taking healthcare away from Republicans like Meadows. Because if America can t have universal healthcare paid for by the government, our elected officials shouldn t get it either.Featured image via sreenshot",News,8-Mar-17
" Obama’s Press Secretary Just Smacked Down A HUGE Sean Spicer Lie, And It’s Glorious (TWEETS)","In his efforts to weasel out of answering questions about Donald Trump s lie that President Obama tapped Trump Tower s  wires,  Sean Spicer uttered four little words that he now regrets. No, that s above my pay grade,  Spicer told a reporter when asked for evidence that Trump was telling the truth.Jay Carney, President Barack Obama s press secretary, very quickly shut down Spicer s claim that he does not have access to that information via Twitter.  Actually, his  pay grade  is the highest possible at WH   same as for chief of staff, national security and other senior personnel,  Carney tweeted:Actually, his ""pay grade"" is the highest possible at WH   same as for chief of staff, national security and other senior personnel. https://t.co/V3BENwFHjI  Jay Carney (@JayCarney) March 7, 2017Yes, this means that Sean Spicer lied to you.On Saturday, Trump dropped a bigger lie about Obama than the whole Kenya thing (and that was a whopper). Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my  wires tapped  in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  our alleged President said as part of an extended rant that was clearly intended to distract from the very real scandals related to him, his campaign, his staff, and a little shirtless Russian guy he calls Vladdy Poot Poot (we assume on that last bit). A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,  Obama responded via spokesman Kevin Lewis.  As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false. So far Trump has not been able to provide a shred of evidence and even some of Obama s most vocal opponents have failed to defend The Donald. Nevertheless Trump has demanded that the Republican Congress distract themselves from any of those pesky Russia investigations by looking into whether or not Obama did the stupid and illegal thing he falsely said he did. They agreed, because they legitimately do not care what laws he breaks.Watch Spicer lie again below:Featured image via screengrab",News,8-Mar-17
" Trump Sickeningly Dares To Claim He Respects Women On Twitter, And Gets SHREDDED For It","Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, and Donald Trump has definitely pissed off women across the country. His latest tweets aren t helping.During the 2016 campaign, Trump talked disparagingly about women and even got caught bragging about grabbing women by the genitals without their consent, which is sexual assault. Since taking office, Trump has punished women by trying to defund Planned Parenthood, threatened funding for organizations that help women obtain an abortion, and trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Trump was furious over the Women s March on Washington and criticized it.

 Top Democrat: I Will Make Comey Answer For Trump’s Wiretapping Allegations,"Representative Adam Schiff is clearly fed up with Donald Trump s lies. This is especially true of Trump s latest lie, which is the insane accusations he made on Saturday morning about President Obama wiretapping Trump Tower during the 2016 election. Of course, this is the most outrageous statement ever made by a sitting president, but it s Donald Trump, so of course he did it. Well, there are hearings coming up regarding ties between the Trump campaign and Russian hacking, so Rep. Schiff is looking forward to getting to the bottom of all of this.Appearing on Tuesday night s edition of The Rachel Maddow Show, the Ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said that he intends to ask FBI Director James Comey directly about Trump s wild Twitter accusations against the former President. Schiff said of the upcoming March 20 hearings: The president has asked our committee to investigate this and I would say, Mr. President, we accept. We will investigate this. We should be able to determine in fairly short order whether this allegation is true or false. Rep. Schiff went on to say that if (as we all know they will) the allegations turn out to be false, it s just as huge of a scandal, if not more so, as it would be if they were true, since it would be the scandal of a sitting U.S. president alleging that his predecessor engaged in the most unscrupulous and unlawful conduct. Adam Schiff is right. Further, if and when it comes out that Trump flat-out lied, that really should be an impeachable offense. And if that isn t enough, the House Intelligence Committee has an all-star line-up of people who will be testifying, including National Security Agency head Admiral Mike Rogers, former CIA director John Brennan, former National Intelligence Director James Clapper, and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, among others.Pop your popcorn, folks. The testimony is sure to be damning.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,7-Mar-17
 The GOP Is Quietly Working On A New And VILE Way To Sh*t On American Consumers,"Doesn t Corporate America get enough breaks at the expense of the everyday American? Apparently not, because they re working on a bill that would limit the ability of the American consumer to sue, even in cases of gross negligence and flat-out illegal acts. Already it s difficult to sue due to all the legal fine print that corporations use specifically to make it harder to sue. And now Republicans want to expand and cement corporations immunity from responsibility.Of course, they gave it a name intended to deceive us into believing they re making things more fair for everyone. Leveling the playing field. Things like that. It s called the  Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act of 2017.  It s anything but fair   it tips the balance of lawsuits so far towards corporations that it s obscene.Class action lawsuits  are often the only avenue for Americans to hold corporations accountable if they are victims of widespread illegal behavior.  In other words, victims of fraud and scams, unsafe products and workplaces, and of human and civil rights violations, would have little to no recourse, according to a detailed analysis from Elizabeth Burch from the University of Georgia s School of Law.Other egregious behavior companies could get away with include price fixing, gender discrimination, securities fraud could go unchecked, deceptive or even false advertising could likewise go unchecked, and so much more.Sure, there are laws in place that prohibit all of that, but holding companies truly responsible for the harm that their lawlessness causes involves hurting their bottom line. Do Republicans plan to put inspectors in every corporation there is, just to ensure that they all follow the law? Class-action suits really are our only method of holding a corporation s feet to the fire when they break the law.Should this bill pass, it s anything but  America first,  and as such, it s a major kick in the face to regular consumers. Republicans are disgusting.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,7-Mar-17
 Watch As MSNBC Reporter Completely Humiliates Sean Spicer Over Trump’s Wiretapping B.S.,"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was completely humiliated by MSNBC s Hallie Jackson during Tuesday s White House briefing. Jackson wanted to know why Donald Trump would call on Congress to investigate the supposed wiretapping at Trump Tower when he claims to already have this very information. This was a question Spicer couldn t answer. All he could do was squirm. You said the president stands by his tweets Saturday morning that President Obama ordered this wiretap,  Jackson stated.  You ve also said that the president wants Congress to investigate. Some members of Congress, by the way, have asked the White House and asked the president to come forward with the information. So bottom line, why would the president want Congress to investigate for information he already has?  she asked.Spicer started blubbering about the importance of  separation of powers  but came nowhere near actually addressing the issue at hand.Jackson wasn t about to let him off the hook that easy, though. She continued to press Spicer, wondering  if the president has the info, Sean   and I guess that s what I m trying to get to   if he s sitting on this information that he found out, he s now directing or asking or recommending that the intelligence committees look into this. And you talked about they have resources and staff, which they do, but why expend those resources and staff if the President found out this information and has it? Spicer then explained that Trump thinks Congress asking the Justice Department to conduct an investigation might  add credibility to the look  of Trump s bogus accusation that former President Obama tapped his phones during the election. I think we ve made it very clear how he wants this done,  Spicer finally concluded when he could think of nothing better to say.Watch Sean Spicer be completely humiliated by MSNBC s Hallie Jackson:Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,7-Mar-17
 Watch NBC’s Andrea Mitchell Get BULLIED Out Of The State Dept. For Asking About Russia (VIDEO),"If one thing has become abundantly clear, it s that Donald Trump and his administration don t like to answer questions, especially questions surrounding Russia.Trump seems to have set a clear standard for those who work with him that the press is not to be trusted. From his abusive and unconstitutional  fake news  attacks to the clear ignoring of questions that the American people want to know the answers to.Ignoring questions and treating the press like dirt has seemingly also spread to the State Department, and on Tuesday morning, NBC s Andrea Mitchell alongside several others from the press were herded up and bullied out, all the while no questions were answered.Mitchell tried to get a few pressing answers from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. She asked: Can you respond to the threats from China? Can you be sure the Trump administration will be strong against Vladimir Putin? Can you assure us that Russia will not be able to move further in Ukraine? You can then see Mitchell grabbed by the arms and escorted out while saying: We haven t had any time in here. This all begs the question, why doesn t the Trump administration want to answer any questions? What are they hiding?The more they remain elusive from the press, the more people will assume they are up to no good, so one would think they would want to remain transparent and respect the right of a free press.What this shows is that our press are disrespected, but it also shows that press, especially those like Andrea Mitchell, aren t about to be bullied around so easily and will still report the story.Good.Watch the confrontation here:You guys.

 Sean Spicer: When Trump Blamed ‘Obama’ Earlier ‘Obviously’ He Didn’t Mean ‘Obama’ (VIDEO),"Lyin  Donald Trump tweeted this morning that former President Barack Obama was responsible for 122  vicious prisoners  being released from Guantanamo Bay and returning to the battlefield. However, that never happened. Trump is blaming an unemployed black guy for his predecessor s actions. Trump s tweet read,  122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield. Just another terrible decision!  That s some real Alt-fact thinking right there. So White House press secretary Sean Spicer had to clean up after his boss s mess but he did a terrible job.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence states that 113 of the 122 former detainees who have taken up arms again were released before Obama s first term, meaning during the Bush administration s time in office. Obviously the president meant in totality, the number that had been released on the battlefield   that have been released from Gitmo since individuals have been released,  Spicer told reporters on Tuesday.  That is correct.  We know that hurts your brain, too.Sure, OBVIOUSLY, when Trump said  Obama  he really meant something else.The White House is backpedaling on Trump s accusation that Obama tapped the amateur president before the election. CNN s Jim Acosta asked Spicer,  Where is the proof?  Spicer said that  it s not a question of new proof or less proof or whatever,  but it s about bringing in Congress to get to the bottom of this.Then this happened:New York Times  Glenn Thrush followed up by pressing Spicer again on the evidence for Trump s claims, and after that Reuters  Ayesha Rascoe asked Spicer about whether Trump can just make declarative statements like that on Twitter and then get committees to look into it.Spicer went on to insist that going through the intelligence committees is the proper avenue for investigating. Rascoe asked whether we should, then, be taking Trump s tweets  at face value. Watch Spicer squirm:That s what you call a swing and a miss, Sean.White House spokesman Sean Spicer says WH will not present any proof of President Trump's allegation that President Obama committed a crime.  Binyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) March 7, 2017Spicer doesn t want the GOP plan to replace Obamacare called Trumpcare and we don t blame him because it s a fucking raw deal for everyone except the wealthy.Sean Spicer ""It's not TrumpCare, it's PatientCare.""Yes, be PATIENT because you'll need to win the lottery to afford it.#PressBriefing  Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) March 7, 2017Back to Gitmo.

 Ben Carson Got SMOKED By Samuel L. Jackson For Saying Slaves Were Immigrants,"For at least one day, Donald Trump did not say the stupidest thing. His Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson did, and he got burned by actor Samuel L. Jackson.While delivering remarks about immigrants, Carson actually had the gall to claim that slaves were immigrants, too, as if they voluntarily left their homes in Africa to do back-breaking work in America for free along with getting beaten and whipped and sold like livestock. That s what America is about,  Carson said.  A land of dreams and opportunity. There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder for less. But they, too, had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great-granddaughters might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land. Seriously. Carson literally thinks slaves were immigrants.His stupidity immediately drew mockery from people across the country on social media. In particularly, Samuel L. Jackson s response was the best.Jackson s response was short and sweet and included his trademark profanity. And Carson definitely deserved it.OK!! Ben Carson .I can t! Immigrants ? In the bottom of SLAVE SHIPS??!! MUTHAFUKKA PLEASE!!!#dickheadedtom  Samuel L. Jackson (@SamuelLJackson) March 6, 2017For centuries prior to and until the Civil War, slaves were kidnapped from their native lands and chained up in the bottom of super crowded slave ships where many would die of disease. Once they arrived in America they were treated like livestock, sold to other people, and given new names.Carson and many other conservatives would have us believe that black people volunteered to be slaves but that s a complete and utter lie that goes against everything we know about slavery.Ben Carson should be ashamed of himself and his stupidity. What he said is the same thing racists say to justify the crimes against humanity white people in this country committed. They think we did black people a favor by enslaving them. But the fact is that slavery is wrong and has been a stain on our history that will never fade, especially if people like Ben Carson keep spewing this revisionist history bullshit.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,7-Mar-17
 BREAKING: Sources Reveal Trump HIMSELF Met With Russian Ambassador During Campaign (DETAILS),"In what could be the most damning information revealed yet, and what seems to be a remarkable oversight by most of the media, the Wall Street Journal published an article in May 2016 revealing that Donald Trump himself met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Ivanovich Kislyak.While everyone has been focused on trying to figure out which members of Trump s campaign had met with Russian representatives, it s printed that Trump met with him, and met with him during his presidential campaign. This is a very, very huge deal considering Trump has time and time again said that he hadn t been talking to Russia.According to the Wall Street Journal in an article titled  Donald Trump Goes His Own Way With Vladimir Putin  it shows Trump saying this: I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible,  Mr. Trump said in a foreign-policy speech at Washington s Mayflower Hotel in April.  Some say the Russians won t be reasonable. I intend to find out. WSJ then reports: A few minutes before he made those remarks, Mr. Trump met at a VIP reception with Russia s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Ivanovich Kislyak. Mr. Trump warmly greeted Mr. Kislyak and three other foreign ambassadors who came to the reception. Yes, that s the same Sergey Ivanovich Kislyak who met with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, went to the Republican National Convention, and was in attendance at Trump s Joint Address to Congress.Kislyak seems to be a major player in Trump s long game seeing as he is in regular attendance pretty much everywhere. This fact is rather alarming considering  Kislyak is considered Moscow s  Top Spy Recruiter  in the United States. Don t expect the Trump/Russia story to go away anytime soon. If anything, it is just heating up and deserves more scrutiny than any other story around. If Trump is connected directly to Russia, and Russia did, in fact, help Trump win the election, that s not only a direct threat to national security and our democratic process but it is a global threat as well.The Russia connections will continue to present themselves and Trump will be seen as the fraud and colluding traitor that he may very well be.Featured Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,7-Mar-17
 Obamacare Vs Trumpcare Meme DESTROYS GOP’s Health Care Replacement Fail (TWEETS),"Donald Trump and the Republican Party s push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) was met with protests and resistance all around the country. Despite being well aware that their  replacement  would be stripping millions of Americans (especially the ill and lower-income citizens) of their life-saving, affordable health insurance, the GOP has continued to push forward with their horrible idea   and now they re getting annihilated for it on the internet.On Monday, Republicans released a draft bill of their Obamacare replacement  the American Health Care Act. As expected with anything that Trump or the Republican Party does, it was not received well and is already considered a massive failure just 24 hours after its release. To commemorate yet another major fail by the GOP and its corrupt, deranged leader, the internet came to the rescue and tore the new replacement apart   by making it a meme!Here s some of the best Obamacare vs. Trumpcare memes we could find, which makes the GOP s latest f**k up just a little more tolerable:          Out of all of them, this one is sure to make Trump explode and throw a Twitter temper tantrum, as we all know how damn sensitive he was (and still is) about the pathetic size of his inauguration crowds.Hopefully, these hilarious memes will force more Americans to pay attention to what Trump and the GOP is trying to do to Americans. The GOP s replacement plan puts Americans  health care in jeopardy, and will make it much more expensive for many.The GOP and Trump have not been listening to the American people. If they truly cared what the majority of Americans wanted, Obamacare would be left alone or amended at best. According to a poll by CNN/ORC, most Americans are satisfied with their health care and don t want Obamacare to be taken away. But then again, if Republicans actually cared about what the majority of Americans wanted, we d have Hillary Clinton in the White House and none of this would be happening.Featured image via Twitter",News,7-Mar-17
 McCain CALLS OUT Trump: Show Us The Evidence!,"Donald Trump screwed himself over by letting his tiny little hands go Twitter-happy over the weekend. Just because he was pissed off over Jeff Sessions  recusal, Trump failed to manage his emotions like an adult and couldn t keep his temper tantrum in check. America watched on, horrified, as the current POTUS accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping his phones in the Trump Tower on Saturday morning. And now, he s facing severe consequences as people want answers.It is already highly probably that Trump has zero evidence to back up his accusation of Obama, mostly because he frequently lies and spreads false information based on his emotional state. Trump has also repeatedly been asked to provide concrete proof that Obama tapped his phones, and hasn t been able to show anything that would make his inappropriate accusations believable. Even Trump s fellow Republicans are demanding answers to such a ridiculous attack, one of them being Sen. John McCain, who has been a critical conservative voice against Trump since his presidential campaign.On Monday, McCain demanded that Trump release evidence to support his allegations, and also trashed the White House for not being able to provide more information about Trump s claims. McCain argued that Americans have a right to know on what basis the president of the United States said that his predecessor had broken the law by wiretapping Trump Tower. Clearly shocked by the whole matter, McCain admitted to reporters,  I haven t seen anything like this.  Noting that the Trump administration  should answer questions,  McCain said: The American people should demand it. The dimensions of this are huge. McCain went on to say just how shocking Trump s weekend tweets had been. McCain admitted that when he saw Trump s first tweet against Obama on Saturday morning, his first reaction was  intense curiosity. This is unprecedented. I have never heard of a president of the United States accusing his predecessor or any other president of the United States of violating the law. Trump had given America many firsts over the past year or so, and none of them were good. That is something we all can agree on, regardless of party affiliation. McCain s comments prove that even the GOP is regretful and fed up of Trump s behavior.Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",News,7-Mar-17
" Trump Says Republican ‘Make America Sick Again’ Bill Is ‘Wonderful,’ Stands By Utter Failure","Donald Trump thinks the healthcare bill Republicans passed to repeal the Affordable Care Act is  wonderful  and promised even more such bills to come. We are sooo screwed.After years of trying to repeal the landmark healthcare law, House Republicans passed a bill on Monday that they dubiously named the  American Healthcare Act. Except that there is nothing  American  about it, nor does it provide healthcare to anyone who needs it.The monstrous bill pretty much leaves 30 million Americans out in the cold without insurance. Republicans stripped subsidies away from low-income Americans and will give them to families who can actually afford to pay for healthcare without government aid. The bill also wipes out the Medicaid expansion that allowed millions more to obtain coverage. Furthermore, the bill kills the insurance mandate, which guaranteed that enough Americans would have health insurance that the insurance pool would be able to cover people with pre-existing conditions. The bill also makes senior citizens pay more for healthcare and defunds Planned Parenthood, which would strip low-income women of the health services they need, including cancer screenings.Overall, the bill a big  fuck you  from Republicans to the American people. So, of course, Trump loves it.Trump crowed about the Republican bill and then attacked the Affordable Care Act by claiming that it is  imploding.However, it s only  imploding  because Trump and Republicans are sabotaging it so it doesn t work the way it should.Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster   is imploding fast!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2017Trump then tweeted that this bill is only the first  phase  of his plan to destroy healthcare in this country. And he actually thinks that  getting rid of state lines  will bring the cost of healthcare down.Don t worry, getting rid of state lines, which will promote competition, will be in phase 2 & 3 of healthcare rollout. @foxandfriends  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2017And apparently, drug prices is one of his targets.I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2017Knowing Trump, that means Americans who rely on affordable and accessible pharmaceuticals are about to get hammered.This is a really bad bill for the American people. So bad, in fact, that four Republican senators are prepared to oppose it, which means it will be dead on arrival in the Senate. A majority of Americans support the Affordable Care Act and the protections and benefits it provides. The uninsured rate is at an all-time low and more people have access to healthcare than ever before. Trump s plan will only hurt tens of millions of Americans while setting healthcare in this country back by decades.Featured image via Jim Lo Scalzo   Pool/Getty Images",News,7-Mar-17
 EXPLOSIVE REPORT: Fmr. NSA Analyst Reveals Team Trump Working With Russians To Punish Reporters,"We all know how hostile the Trump White House is to the press. They say that anything they don t like is  FAKE NEWS  and they have even gone so far as to ban critical mainstream outlets from a press gaggle with White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Now, an analyst who used to work with the National Security Agency (NSA), John Schindler, is alleging that Team Trump is actually targeting individual journalists for retribution   and they are doing it with the help of Russian intelligence.Learned fm very reliable IC sources that Trump WH, w/help fm Russian intel, is targeting US journalists. Rough road ahead. Get ready, peeps  John Schindler (@20committee) March 7, 2017Of course, Team Trump would have us all believe they ve never, ever, colluded with the Russians to do anything, but there s an awful lot of smoke where that is concerned already; all we need is the proverbial smoking gun.This really comes as no surprise, no matter how chilling it might be. The Trump Administration has already been implicated in pushing out a false story to discredit Politico reporter Alex Isenstadt, accusing him of laughing at the tragic death of Navy Seal Ryan Owens, who was killed in Trump s botched Yemen raid.Of course, we all remember Trump s repeated claim   both via Twitter and during his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)   that the press is, quote, the  enemy of the American people.  This is beyond Nixonian at this point. Trump and his White House are actively doing all they can to undermine the free press, and even savage the reputations and careers of individual journalists.Considering the spinelessness of the GOP-led Congress, the media   our Fourth Estate   is really the only check we have right now on this out of control president and his dangerous, incompetent team of authoritarians and wannabe tin-pot dictators.Don t back down, bloggers, reporters, and other newsy types. It s now ALL of our job to speak truth to power and let all who will listen know just what this White House and this administration is about.

 Prominent Attorney And Law Professor Points Out That Trump Can Be Impeached For False Accusation Against Obama,"When Donald Trump falsely accused President Obama of wiretapping him he committed an impeachable offense.That s what Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe wrote in response to Jonathan Turley on Tuesday after Turley claimed that Trump can t be impeached for posting  bad tweets. During an appearance on Morning Joe, Turley claimed that Trump could not be impeached for accusing President Obama of wiretapping him because the Constitution was written before Twitter was invented. There s no penalty to the president for bad tweets,  the George Washington University law professor claimed.  There s no impeachment for bad tweets,  he continued, arguing that the impeachment clause doesn t apply because Twitter  postdated the impeachment clause. Basically, Turley is saying that the Constitution only applies to society as it was in the 18th century, which is the kind of bullshit that conservative originalists use as an excuse to block progress.Well, Tribe was watching on Tuesday and he fired off a series of tweets slamming Turley. Using power of W[hite] H[ouse] to falsely accuse predecessor of impeachable felony does qualify as an impeachable offense whether via tweet or not,  Tribe concluded.1/On @JoeNBC @JonathanTurley says Trump s false claim that 44 wiretapped him cdn t be impeachable because #Twitter didn t exist when the  Laurence Tribe (@tribelaw) March 7, 20172/Impeachment Cl. was written in 1787.

 WATCH: Trump Defender Gets HUMILIATED By Anderson Cooper For Absurd Wiretapping Claim,"Donald Trump s media supporters are working overtime this week trying to defend his wiretapping accusations against President Obama.On Saturday, Trump openly made the accusation on Twitter without providing a single shred of evidence to back up his assertion. Trump made the claim after reading a conspiracy theory on Breitbart and even called for Congress to investigate.Again, Trump has provided no proof to support his accusation and an accusation without proof doesn t justify an investigation.Trump has had days to provide such evidence and has failed to produce any. But Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany claimed during a panel discussion on CNN on Monday night that Trump has evidence that he will release sometime in the future. And she got totally owned for it by Anderson Cooper.McEnany insisted that Trump has evidence that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. But Cooper was quick to remind her that if that were true he would have released it by now and that it would be easy for Trump to confirm whether his accusation is true or not simply by asking certain intelligence and law enforcement agencies. But we know this by now, the president could know this by now by picking up the phone if he really believed this and if he s really that mad about this, he can find out the information,  Cooper said.  He s the most powerful guy in the United States, in the world. Indeed, but FBI Director James Comey has already strongly shot down Trump s accusation, and former National Intelligence Director James Clapper said on Sunday that he would have been informed had President Obama ordered such a wiretap, whether legal or not.Cooper then dropped the hammer by pointing out that if Trump really had evidence he wouldn t be demanding an investigation by Congress. If he had that information, why is he saying that it s President Obama who did this personally and why is he calling for a congressional investigation to find out when he could find out?  Cooper asked.Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump does not have evidence to back up his serious accusation against President Obama. He knows that he is slandering him and is desperately turning to Republicans in Congress to help him manufacture proof that is nonexistent. If Trump had any proof at all he would be screaming it out from the rooftops to prove that he was right. Because he s too much of a narcissist to keep that kind of information to himself.Featured image via screenshot ",News,7-Mar-17
 WATCH: Republican Rep Thinks Poor Americans Can Afford Healthcare If They Don’t Buy A Cell Phone,"Republicans are delusional if they really believe forgoing a new cell phone will allow poor people to afford healthcare.But that s exactly what Utah GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz believes.On Monday, House Republicans passed a monstrous bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act which pretty much leaves 30 million Americans out in the cold without insurance. Republicans stripped subsidies away from low-income Americans and will give them to families who can actually afford to pay for healthcare without government aid. The bill also wipes out the Medicaid expansion that allowed millions more to obtain coverage. Furthermore, the bill kills the insurance mandate, which guaranteed that enough Americans would have health insurance that the insurance pool would be able to cover people with pre-existing conditions. The bill also makes senior citizens pay more for healthcare and defunds Planned Parenthood, which would strip low-income women of the health services they need, including cancer screenings.During an interview to defend his party s evil bill on Tuesday morning, Chaffetz actually had the gall to claim that poor people could afford health insurance if they didn t go out and purchase iPhones.Seriously, he literally used this as an excuse to strip 30 million people of their health insurance. You know what, Americans have choices, and they ve got to make a choice,  Chaffetz said.  And so maybe, rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on, maybe they should invest in their own health care. Here s the video via Twitter.GOP Rep. Chaffetz: Americans may need to choose between  new iphone  they just love  and investing in health care https://t.co/5Hxwn2uOl5  New Day (@NewDay) March 7, 2017Chaffetz s ignorant remarks make it clear that he doesn t know anything about the cost of healthcare, probably because his healthcare is free courtesy of American taxpayers.As Raw Story points out, the average cost of a health insurance plan is $235 per month while an iPhone costs just $27 a month with a two-year payment plan.In short, choosing not to buy an iPhone will not do anything to help poor Americans afford healthcare.Meanwhile, Republicans like Chaffetz can actually afford to buy their own health insurance because they make $174,000 a year. But they don t have to buy their own insurance because they get government healthcare along with the best hospitals all on the taxpayer dime.Chaffetz, and every Republican who voted for this bill, is a hypocrite and they should be ashamed of themselves.Featured image via screenshot",News,7-Mar-17
 Trump Kicks Off His Tuesday By Lying About President Obama And Get RIPPED APART By Twitter (TWEETS),"Tuesday morning, Donald Trump started off his day by tweeting yet another outrageous lie about President Obama, apparently unsatisfied with his weekend tweetstorm accusing his favorite Muslim Kenyan socialist nemesis who totally isn t an American citizen of tapping his  wires  at Trump Tower. 122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield. Just another terrible decision!  Trump claimed after apparently seeing a Fox News report that 122 have returned to the battlefield except not even Fox News was stupid enough to attempt to pass that off on President Obama.122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield.

 Rachel Maddow Perfectly Explains Why Trump’s Sketchy Deals Are So Dangerous To America (VIDEO),"We recently reported on how it has now come to light, thanks to the wonderful investigative reporting at The New Yorker, that Donald Trump is involved in some seriously shady business dealings. In one instance, he has a hotel that seems to be nothing more than a front for shady ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which is considered to be a sponsor of terrorism. The people who signed off on the hotel deal also are corrupt as all hell, and seem to get their money by laundering it via government corruption. Well, there is one person in the news business who always breaks this stuff down in the best way possible: MSNBC s Rachel Maddow.On Thursday s edition of the Rachel Maddow Show, the fiery host explains the situation with Trump and his family s ties and how it could make Trump vulnerable to blackmail by these dangerous foreign terrorists. Of course, with Trump being president, that means the danger also extends to the American people. According to Maddow, this deal is so potentially dangerous that Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), actually wants a whole new investigation just for this shady sham of a hotel deal.Another interesting tidbit that Maddow points out is the fact that it is illegal for American business people to do business with foreign entities that have been sanctioned due to terrorist ties. In fact, it s seen as such an egregious crime that if caught, one faces serious jail time. Hopefully, Trump s clear incompetence forces him to slip up on this one, and he winds up in prison, right where he belongs.There s no one like Rachel Maddow to explain something like this, though, so, without further ado, here is the video:Featured image via video screen capture",News,7-Mar-17
" The GOP ‘Make America Sick Again’ Plan Was Released, And It’s WORSE Than You Thought (DETAILS)","Republicans finally rolled out their plan to replace the Affordable Care Act on Monday and it is even worse than expected.While the full ramifications of the  Make America Sick Again  plan, (or as Republicans are calling it, the American Health Care Act) are still being discovered as everybody sifts through the 123-page bill, here is a quick overview of what is understood so far.First. the good news. The new plan will keep two important provisions of Obamacare. Protections for pre-existing conditions will remain in place and parents will continue to be able to keep their children on their policies until age 26.Now, the bad. And boy is there a lot of that.Corporations and billionaires, on the other hand, make out like fat rats under the Republicans  replacement plan.Not all Republicans are on board with the replacement bill, though. Four Republican senators   Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska   all signed a letter arguing that the plan would be a disaster for their states, as well as others, who had expanded Medicaid.Three more Republicans, Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, have all made it known that they have serious reservations about the bill.Naturally, there is much more detail and specifics than I have covered here.

 ‘Drain The Swamp’ Trump Is Now Doing White House Ads For Corporate America (VIDEO),"A White House press release which congratulated Exxon Mobil Corp. for its recent investment in U.S. manufacturing appears to be copied from a paragraph from the oil company s own release, CNN s Jake Tapper reported Monday. It s straight up plagiarism, word for word.

The company s Growing the Gulf expansion program, consists of 11 major chemical, refining, lubricant and liquefied natural gas projects at proposed new and existing facilities along the Texas and Louisiana coasts. Investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue through at least 2022. But it gets worse. Trump pretty much just gave a shout out to Exxon Mobil Corp. in an ad released on Twitter to his 26.1 million followers.There is an incredible spirit of optimism sweeping the country right now we're bringing back the JOBS! pic.twitter.com/BNSLvKiEVj  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 6, 2017After campaigning on  Drain the Swamp  as his tagline, Trump filled his cabinet up with terrifying swamp creatures such as secretary of state Rex Tillerson who previously served as the CEO of Exxon Mobil from 2006 to 2016. Tillerson had to leave his position with the company in order to go through the Senate confirmation process for the post.During his confirmation hearing, Tillerson said,  I have never lobbied against [Russian] sanctions personally,  Tillerson said.  To my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions.  That s not true, though.Trump campaigned on working for the middle class, those who possibly felt forgotten and shifted toward the back burner. Instead, he wants to lower tax rates on the wealthiest, eradicate Obamacare, rape the environment, ban Muslims from entering our borders (you can put pretty words on an executive order but it is what it is), and he s making a huge profit from his alleged presidency. Trump is in this for Trump and no one else. He d kick a puppy in the face if he and/or his billionaire buddies could profit from it.Image via screen capture. ",News,6-Mar-17
" While Everyone Was Distracted, Here Are Five Ways Trump Just Moved To F*ck Over Middle America","The Donald Trump administration is desperate and like a cornered wild animal, Trump is lashing out at everyone, hoping he ll land a bite that will stick. Over the weekend, the target of Trump s delusional Twitter rant was President Obama, who Trump accused of wiretapping him. There s zero evidence and even conservatives are beginning to question Trump s sanity.Now, I won t go so far as to say Trump is crazy like a fox   no, he s just plain crazy   but he also uses his Twitter account in an almost clever way. He uses it to distract from the real damage and flat out destruction he and his Republican cohorts are doing to this country.Will Bunch of the Philadelphia Inquirer outlined three ways in which Trump is giving the country a legislative middle finger and because of Trump s ridiculous tweets, the media is ignoring almost all of them.Donald Trump put as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, a man who has sued the agency a total of 13 times. Trump wants to all but gut the agency, leaving us with filthy air, water and ultimately, food, but hey, those polluting industries will see hefty profits.No, the administration doesn t want to stop global warming. They just don t want us to study it or hear about it. In fact, they don t even want us to know about the weather. The administration wants to cut the funding of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency by more than half a billion dollars.In some ways, the second ban is worse than its predecessor. It signals that the Trump Administration is determined to pursue its anti-Muslim, extremist agenda and will not be hindered by courts   nor by the showing of public concern which followed the first ban. That remarkable cultural moment   symbolized by the immediate airport protests and sustained by the solidarity of faith groups, civil rights figures and celebrities who ve spoken out repeatedly over the last month   seems to have gone unheeded by the Trump Administration.Source: Time.comWe have a couple to add.This is true of Trump s tax proposals, which redirect wealth from the poor to the ultrarich. No one who supports repealing the estate tax can credibly be called a  populist.  It s also true about his health care proposals, which slash benefits for low-income people while cutting taxes on the well-to-do. And it looks like this pattern will hold with respect to Trump s forthcoming budget proposal, in which the  populist  president will ask for a big hike in defense spending while inflicting painful cuts on social programs.Source: SalonDonald Trump, Jr. told The Washington Post that he and his brother Eric were inspired by many places they visited while with their father on the campaign trail. While Trump has not divested from his company, he s turned over management of the Trump brand to his sons. The plan now is to build new properties, starting with a more affordable chain of hotels, Scion, in a number of cities across the nation, many of which the brothers became acquainted with while on the long road to the White House.Source: Vanity FairTrump hasn t divested himself from his businesses, so if his sons are profiting, so is he.The point of this is to not let ourselves become distracted by the latest shiny object, even if it is an absurd series of tweets. Donald Trump might not last a full term, but he can do a lot of damage before he leaves. He s already started. Let s focus on that as well.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,6-Mar-17
 Muslim Internment Flyers SHOCK Students Of UC San Diego With Stark Warning,"Students at the University of California, San Diego, were shocked this week when Muslim internment flyers were posted around the campus.NBC 7, a local channel in San Diego, report that the flyers were posted on billboards around the campus and  took the form of Internment Notices, which signaled the roundup of thousands of Japanese Americans during World War II. But these notices targeted Muslims. The poster read, in part: All Muslim persons, both alien and non-alien, will be evacuated from the above designated area by 12:00 o clock noon Wednesday, April 8, 2017. No Muslim person will be permitted to enter or leave the above described area after 8:00 a.m., Thursday, April 2, 2017, without obtaining special permission from the Provost Marshal at the Civil Control Station A person claiming responsibility for the flyers emailed NBC and explained that the posters were not intended to be  anti-Muslim.  Instead, the goal was to shock and anger people  by using our own shameful past of Japanese internment camps to warn people about the path we are currently on. The posters were meant to mimic the internment posters because I wanted to shock/anger people and to show them what could happen if they didn t do anything to stop it. It was a warning presented as a possible future,  the email read.The flyers appeared on the same day that Donald Trump signed his updated executive order banning citizens of several Muslim majority countries from entering the United States.This time, only six countries are included in the ban since Iraq has been excluded from the list. The updated version also outlines exclusions for valid visa holders, green card holders, and several other groups. Reportedly, Trump decided not to give preferential treatment to Christians in the updated ban either. To avoid the chaos the order created last time, there is a 10-day grace period before the bigoted ban kicks in on March 16.Featured image via Twitter and Wikimedia Commons",News,6-Mar-17
" Sean Spicer Has INSANE MELTDOWN, Gets Hostile With Reporters In Off-Camera Briefing (DETAILS)","White House press secretary Sean Spicer has been known for losing his sh*t, just like his boss Donald Trump   and in an off-camera news briefing on Monday, Spicer had a Trump-sized meltdown as he tried to defend the disgraceful POTUS from his self-created wiretapping debacle.PBS News Hour caught Spicer railing against the media on a live audio stream, capturing Spicer taking a particularly hostile and defensive attitude with reporters as they asked questions about Trump s unverified claims that former President Barack Obama had somehow tapped his phones at the Trump Tower.At the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Trump had blasted the media for using anonymous sources (even though he often does), and even suggested that the media  shouldn t be allowed  to cite anonymous sources. Reporters asked Spicer about Trump s anti-media comments at the CPAC, but this quickly launched into a discussion about Trump s recent accusations against Obama, as well as inquiries about what evidence Trump had to back this up. Spicer responded: People start taking things as fact because a series of off-the-record and anonymous sources   We have started to become a series of believing all these stories, and yet, I ve addressed this in the past, there s nothing there to substantiate. At some point, I would ask people to take on-the-record sources and quotes as important as the countless numbers of anonymous, off-the records. As things heated up, one reporter asked for the source that Trump had gotten his information from regarding the wiretapping. The reporter asked: So, explain this to me then. You re talking about not using anonymous sources   what is, then, the sourcing of the president s tweet on Saturday? Does he believe it s a FISA warrant? That s when poor Spicey lost it. As more reporters tried to join the conversation, the WH press secretary snapped and said: There s no cameras. You can slow it down. And of course, just like the hypocrite he is, Spicer couldn t provide a non-anonymous source. He simply said that reports are out there  from  individuals and sources. Understandably, the reporters wanted more of an answer so they continues to press Spicer. This caused him to fire back again as he said: You re not on camera. You don t need to jump in. You can watch Spicer lost his temper over some straightforward, simple questions below:Featured image via Aaron P. Bernstein / Getty Images",News,6-Mar-17
 WTF: Top Trump Advisor Tells Trump To Kill Liberals (AUDIO),"As if Donald Trump isn t paranoid and delusional enough on his own, one of the people who carries a lot of influence with 45 is one of the most certifiably insane (in my amateur opinion) people to ever hit the airwaves, rabid right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones is now advising Trump to use violence against those who oppose him, and the frightening thing is, Trump could listen.On his YouTube channel show on Monday, Jones fed into Trump s ridiculous conspiracy theory that his offices were wiretapped by President Obama.And I feel so sorry for people that can t see it, that have been caught by this weird demon spirit of the age, to just go along with evil and corruption and just thank god, Mr. President, that we re not the scumbag Obama, the loser of eight years, the failure. Now who thinks he can be the big community organizer down the street from you, who brags it s his plan to bring you down. Then The New York Times acts like it s not true. Codify the data each day, go after them with their own words. Hold up where they admit they were wiretapping your Trump Tower and then show The New York Times saying they re not doing it, just like you have been doing it, and they will fall.There were even more paranoid rantings, but the bottom line was that Trump should kill all his enemies before they take him down:They re going to destroy you, they re going to destroy Barron, they re going to destroy Eric, they re going to destroy Donald Jr., they re going destroy me, they re going to destroy Matt Drudge, they re going to destroy Ron Paul, they re going to destroy anybody like [White House senior adviser] Stephen Bannon that actually stood up for the little people, because that example can t be allowed. Because if you let one ant stand up, they might all stand up, and those little ants outnumber the parasites 1000 to one. If they want a war, let s let them have it. Now they re getting their ass kicked in the economy, your approval ratings are going up. Sir, they don t care. They re going to intimidate and pay off and roll people in your second-level operation to try to burn you. You must go on the offense. This is war. You think George Washington kicked the Redcoats  ass just with information? No.Source: Media MattersThen, with no irony at all, he accused Trump s opponents of being funded by the Russians.Here s the audio:Most people would just dismiss Jones s words as the rantings of a lunatic, which they are, but Trump loves Jones.

 Trump Presidency IMPLODES As 17 Top White House Officials BETRAY Him In EXPLOSIVE Report (DETAILS),"The whirlwind of chaos that follows Donald Trump everywhere he goes has just reached a level we ve never seen before. It turns out, things are way, WAY worse than any of us could have even predicted!According to a new report by The Washington Post, it turns out that the undeserving POTUS isn t the only one who creates mayhem   his staff is right behind him, and it s because they have ZERO loyalty to their awful boss. In a heavily cited article, The Washington Post summed up Trump s shockingly erratic weekend in which he accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping his phones in the Trump Tower. But more importantly, this article lists SEVENTEEN White House officials who spoke out against Trump under the protection of anonymity. The article states: At the center of the turmoil is an impatient president increasingly frustrated by his administration s inability to erase the impression that his campaign was engaged with Russia, to stem leaks about both national security matters and internal discord and to implement any signature achievements.This account of the administration s tumultuous recent days is based on interviews with 17 top White House officials, members of Congress and friends of the president, many of whom requested anonymity to speak candidly.Gnawing at Trump, according to one of his advisers, is the comparison between his early track record and that of Obama in 2009, when amid the Great Recession he enacted an economic stimulus bill and other big-ticket items. To make matters even worse for Trump, the photo The Washington Post chose as the leading photo is a photograph of Trump with his grandchildren   while pointing out the fact that the sloppy former reality television star literally uses tape to hold his tie together:This couldn t be worse news for Trump, who has previously flipped out about leaks from within his staff.

What if the abolitionists had said,  I don t believe in slavery, I think it s wrong, but you guys do whatever you want to do?    Carson added. The retired neurosurgeon does not believe in abortion even in cases of incest or rape. Abortion is a choice. Slavery is not.Wow, just wow. How did this man ever become a neurosurgeon?

" In One GLORIOUS Move, CNN REFUSES To Bow Down To Trump; He Will Be LIVID (VIDEO)","If there s one thing Donald Trump wants, it s positive press about himself and everything that he is doing. Clearly knowing that his new travel ban Executive Order wasn t going to shine him in the best light, or he was simply afraid of reporters asking him questions he d be forced to give an answer to, Trump didn t allow the press into the Oval Office for the signing. The White House did, however, offer a photo of the signing, but CNN refuses to show it.CNN s John King explains why they won t show the image of Trump holding the Executive Order: We won t show you the picture of the president signing the executive order that s incredibly important to his administration, it s a very important policy debate in our country   we will not show you the picture because we have a policy that you cannot have canned press release pictures from a White House. You have to let the reporters in. The president is a big boy. He doesn t have to answer questions if they re shouted at him, but they wouldn t let anyone in because of the other issue  that is the president saying he believes his predecessor someone wire tapped him during last year s campaign.

 EXPLOSIVE New Report PROVES Trump Hotel Linked To Iranian Terror Organization,"Donald Trump likes to talk tough on terror. However, a new report links a Trump hotel to   you guessed it   a terror cell. Trump and his daughter-wife Ivanka built a hotel and tower in Azerbaijan in 2008 that was first a swanky high rise full of apartments, but in 2014 it became yet another Trump hotel. However, neither incarnation of the project ever opened for business.Now, it seems that the whole thing   called the Trump International Hotel and Baku   is just a front for corruption tied to an oligarch by the name of Ziya Mammadov. Mammadov s father also happens to be the transportation minister of Azerbaijan. The United States government believes that this man is guilty of money laundering for Iran s military. He has never been brought up on any such charges, though.The whole thing looks even shadier when one considers statements from a former official with Azerbaijan s Ministry of Tourism. He says of the Trump property: Why would someone put a luxury hotel there? Nobody who can afford to stay there would want to be in that neighborhood. So, in other words, they have a dormant hotel in a shitty neighborhood for what legitimate purpose exactly? It also turns out that the aforementioned Ziya Mammadov, along with his brother Elton Mammadov are the ones who signed off on this sham property. It also helps to know that this whole family is corrupt to the core and basically make their money through government corruption. They also have suspicious ties to the Iran s Revolutionary Guard. This is a terrorist cell that engages in things like trafficking drugs and sponsoring terrorist activities.Of course, one of Trump s equally shady lawyers, Alan Garten, has already brushed aside the claims, saying that all Trump did was lend his name to the building has no real ties to this whole corrupt mess. The thing is, though, there is money going into Trump s pockets via this deal   to a tune of at least $2.8 million, perhaps more. To that end, do not expect any sort of rebuke of this corruption and sponsoring of terrorism from the Trump Administration.Clearly, Trump s worldwide business interests will influence United States policy, when indeed it should not, ever. This is dangerous beyond anything we have ever seen before. He must be removed.The entire report can be read here, at the New Yorker.Featured image via Jim Lo Scalzo   Pool/Getty Images",News,6-Mar-17
 The Wind Revealed An Unknown Creature Atop Trump’s Head And People CANNOT Stop Watching (VIRAL VIDEO),"With all the absolutely horrific and unhinged things that Donald Trump has been doing and saying since he took office, many have stopped talking about one of the most bizarre things about him.No, not the fact that he eats pizza and KFC with a fork, but his hair. Or rather, what we can only assume is his hair. Let s call it hair-ish or hair-like.And while many will think that going after someone s hair is petty (because it is) it s still something that many people are extremely curious about, because it seems to have a life of its own.Case in point, while Trump was climbing aboard Air Force One, the wind caught Trump s hair from behind and seemingly revealed to the entire world what goes into making that dreadful coif.Brace yourself, because you will never be the same after seeing this. Here s the video:If anyone knows what that might be, they are encouraged to come forward.Trump still seems to pride himself on this signature hairdon t, still not realizing that he could look a million times better, or dare one say, *presidential (barf), if he gave himself a haircut that actually suited his head.Nonetheless, people can t stop watching this video because as horrible as it is, it s absolutely mesmerizing.Featured image via video screen capture",News,6-Mar-17

I have no evidence and no one has presented anything to me that indicates anything like that,  Rubio told Meet The Press on Sunday.  Suffice it to say I don t have any basis, I ve never heard that allegation made before by anybody. I ve never seen anything about that anywhere before. But again, the president put that out there, and now the White House will have to answer as to exactly what he was referring to. Chuck Todd went on t ask Rubio if he would concede that if Trump is lying that it would be a huge political scandal and Rubio agreed.Here s the video via YouTube:Trump is desperate to distract everyone from focusing on his ever-growing Russia scandal, so he made up this lie based on a conspiracy theory he read on Breitbart in the hopes that Congress and the media will shift their focus.This is a serious accusation against a former president and Trump should be severely punished for it. He has offered no evidence to prove his claim and that means he is slandering President Obama, which should result in a lawsuit and impeachment. But we all know that Republicans in Congress have zero credibility so they will more than likely shield Trump and pursue a witch hunt against Obama, who was a more honorable and respected president than Trump will ever be.Featured image via screenshot",News,6-Mar-17
 Even Trey Gowdy Thinks Trump’s Wiretap Conspiracy Is Crazy,"Donald Trump is playing a dangerous game by falsely accusing his predecessor of wiretapping his phone lines before the election. Most people realize when Trump seems unhinged in his Twitter timeline, it s usually to distract the public from what is really going on, such as his scandalous ties to Russia and his new travel ban which remarkably resembles his old travel ban. Republicans and Democrats are both left scratching their heads over Trump s accusations.Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy (S.C.), who spent two years investigating Hillary Clinton over the attacks in Benghazi, said Monday he s seen no evidence to support Trump s claim that former President Obama wiretapped his office during the presidential campaign. I don t think the FBI is the Obama team, and I don t think the men and women who are career prosecutors at [the Department of Justice] belong to any team other than a blindfolded woman holding a pair of scales,  Gowdy told Politico. We have the tools to keep us safe and it s prudent for those tools to be used lawfully and appropriately,  Gowdy continued.  If they re not used lawfully and appropriately, there s a paper trail and we ll be able to find it out. Gowdy continued to say that it was  hard to cross-examine tweets  and any information regarding a FISA warrant used against Trump would be available to the Trump administration.By the way, if a FISA warrant was issued, that would have to be allowed by a judge. Meaning, in that instance, there would be some sort of evidence against Trump, so much so as to wiretap his phones or at least any calls to and or from Russia. The Obama team is no longer in charge,  Gowdy added.  So any information the current Department of Justice has that suggests the previous Department of Justice acted inappropriately, they are welcome to release it. But there is no evidence to release. A sitting president cannot issue a wiretap. That s not how presidenting works, k? There is a process to go through first.Even Jason Chaffetz said today that there is no evidence to back up Trump s claim. Still yet, Chaffetz is willing to investigate Trump s claim while refusing to launch a probe into the alleged president s ties to Russia.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,6-Mar-17
 Cory Booker SCORCHES Trump Over New Muslim Ban In BLISTERING Tweetstorm,"Well, the moment we have all been anticipating has come to pass. Donald Trump and the bigots in his administration have rolled out a new Muslim Ban. There are very few differences. It excludes Iraq, thanks to their vital role in helping the United States government in the fight against the Islamic State. It also will not be rolled out immediately, so that we won t have people being detained mid-travel. It also excludes Green Card holders and those with legal visas prior to January 27, 2017   the date of the original order that was struck down by the courts. there is also language striking down the first order. However, make no mistake   this is still a Muslim ban. The intent is the same, and there is one person who wants to make sure that everyone knows it: New Jersey Senator Cory Booker.Just moments after the news broke that Trump had signed the new order behind closed doors, Senator Booker took to Twitter to go all in on Trump and what he and his goons are doing. This truly an extraordinary rebuke of a sitting Senator of a sitting President. Here are is the flurry of tweets sent out by a clearly furious Booker:A rebranded #MuslimBan is still a Muslim ban.Plain and simple.  Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017It s clear that the Trump administration s intent with this executive order is the same as it was with the first.  Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017They are trying to exclude refugees and immigrants of a certain religion from entering the United States.  Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017The previous Muslim ban was rejected by millions of Americans and blocked by the federal courts.  Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017This reckless and un-American executive order once again blatantly defies our nation s highest ideals and makes our country less safe.  Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017I will fight every step of the way, this renewed attempt to play the worst kind of politics at the expense of our most cherished values.  Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017As history has shown us, so will the American people.  Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017See you in court (again), @realDonaldTrump  Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017Indeed, we will see Trump in court. Just as the first order was rejected, so should the second order. There s really no difference at all, and the claims by Trump and his administration are doing this because of national security concerns have been shown to be baseless by Trump s own Department of Homeland Security.This is the most fundamentally un-American action Trump has taken yet, and considering the things he has done, that s saying something. Senator Booker is right   we ll see him in court.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,6-Mar-17
 Kellyanne Conway Makes A Fool Of Herself Trying To Defend Trump’s Ridiculous Attack On Obama (VIDEO),"On Monday, Trump propaganda minister Kellyanne Conway crawled out of her slimepit to once again defend the indefensible   this time, Trump s ridiculous and baseless allegation that President Obama tapped his  wires  at Trump Tower. He s the president of the United States, he has information and intelligence that the rest of us do not,  Conway told Fox News, adding that  a number of credible media outlets  are  reporting there was politically-motivated activity all during the campaign and suggesting there s more there. Not a single credible news source has reported that President Obama ordered Trump s  wires  tapped. The report initially came from Breitbart, a white supremacist propaganda website. People deserve to know, so why not include in the existing investigations into Russia whether or not this actually happened?  Conway says.What actually happened was Donald Trump read an article that was being passed around the White House, made the mistake of believing it, and melted down on Twitter, sticking to the story even after the conspiracy theorist upon whose claims the story relied admitted he has zero evidence to back it.Trump s allegations are so ridiculous that the FBI asked the Department of Justice Saturday to officially tell the American people Trump is full of sh*t. They have not yet done so.Watch Conway s humiliating performance below:Featured image via screengrab",News,6-Mar-17
 WATCH: Morning Joe Hosts Are DONE With Trump After His Unfounded Accusation Against President Obama,"Donald Trump just ruined any remaining chance he had to get support from MSNBC hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.On Saturday, Trump openly accused President Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower without providing a shred of evidence to support his claim.In response, Joe Scarborough ripped him a new one on Twitter.Ever since Trump made the outrageous accusation, federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies have refuted it, including former National Intelligence Director James Clapper and current FBI Director James Comey.On Monday, the Morning Joe hosts kicked off their show by thoroughly blasting Trump and aired their disappointment that he would make such a claim against a former president.Mika Brzezinski began by calling Trump s accusation  unprecedented. I had hope and an open mind and I have lost hope completely and my mind is closed,  she continued on Trump s presidency. There was a belief that he could turn the corner,  Joe Scarborough said.  What Donald Trump did on Saturday morning has shaken this government and the confidence of its people to the core. It is hard to overstate how reckless that tweet was. The 45th president of the United States accusing the 44th president of tapping his phones, personally tapping his phones, calling him  sick. Mika Brzezinski called Trump s accusations  uncouth  as Scarborough continued to explain how seriously Trump f*cked up. For people comparing this to the birther controversy, context is necessary. It is one thing when a reality TV star accused a president of a sleazy conspiratorial theory. But when a president of the United States accuses another president, the context changes and it becomes dangerous We are in crisis. It s an administration that has lost all credibility at this point,  Brzezinski added.Here s the video via VidMe:At the end of the program, Scarborough remarked that Trump  reached a new low this weekend  and Brzezinski called Trump s presidency  fake and failed. Here s that clip via YouTube:Donald Trump just dug a deeper hole for himself by accusing a former president of wiretapping him. He is literally slandering President Obama because he has no proof to back up his accusations. It s time for Congress to impeach Trump. Trump is causing mass chaos and damaging our government institutions while blatantly ignoring the Constitution. This farce can no longer be allowed to continue. And if Republicans won t do something to save this country from Trump, it will be the duty of the American people to put an end to the Republican Party and put lawmakers in office who will.Featured image via screenshot",News,6-Mar-17
 WATCH: Even Investigation-Obsessed GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz Says Trump Has No Proof Obama Wiretapped Him,"Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz has made a living in Congress starting investigations into just about anything in an effort to hurt Democrats. But even he thinks Donald Trump has nothing to support his accusations against President Obama.On Saturday, Trump made the outrageous claim that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower to spy on him and demanded that Congress investigate even though he didn t offer a single shred of evidence to back up his claims.Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my  wires tapped  in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Trump s accusations were even shot down by former National Intelligence Director James Clapper, who served in the position from 2010 to 2017.Clapper told Meet The Press on Sunday that if President Obama had ordered a wiretap, whether legal or illegal, he would have known about it.Of course, that s not stopping Republicans from including Trump s accusations in their investigation of his Russia scandal, which means we can expect Republicans to focus more of their energy trying to desperately prove Trump s claim than they will on revealing Trump s ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin.But one Republican concedes that he hasn t seen anything that would support Trump s accusation.Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz loves investigations. He is obsessed with witch hunts against Democrats and will start endless investigations into anything if he thinks it could be a scandal to hit Democrats with. On the other hand, he isn t really interested in investigating Republicans like Trump when true scandals like Russian interference in the election arise. But even he says that Trump has nothing to prove his accusations against President Obama. You never know when you turn a corner what you may or may not see,  Chaffetz said on CBS This Morning. But thus far I have not seen anything directly that would support what the president has said. Despite that concession, Chaffetz has offered to support an investigation into Trump s allegations even though he isn t interested in leading the investigation himself. Look, it s a very serious allegation,  Chaffetz continued.  The president has at his fingertips tens of billions of dollars in intelligence apparatus. I ve got to believe   I think he might have something there, but if not, we re going to find out. Here s the video via YouTube:So Chaffetz literally went from saying that Trump has nothing to saying that he might have something. This is the kind of double-speak that Americans despise from politicians.The fact is that Trump has zero evidence to support his claims and Congress has no evidence to justify starting an investigation based on those claims. Trump is slandering President Obama based on a conspiracy theory he read on Breitbart and Republicans appear to be willing to start a witch hunt over it. And American taxpayers will be paying for it.Donald Trump is hoping to distract Congress from investigating his Russia scandal by telling lies about President Obama. It s sad that Republicans are incapable of seeing through Trump s bullshit. As usual, Republicans are demonstrating that they would rather investigate Democrats instead of doing anything that threatens their own power.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,6-Mar-17
 Trump Is Literally Causing Business Owners To Go Broke Because Of His Mar-a-Lago Trips,"Rather than making America great again, Donald Trump is making American business owners in Florida go broke.Every time Trump spends the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, it costs taxpayers $3 million. So far, Trump has spent nearly every weekend there since taking office, and the price tag has eclipsed $10 million.If Trump continues taking weekend vacations at his current pace, he ll outspend President Obama s entire eight years of vacation costs in just under a single year.Taxpayers are going to feel the burden of this, but business owners in Palm Beach are especially feeling the pain because Trump s frequent visits are literally going to put them out of business if he doesn t stop.Because of the extra security, businesses in Palm Beach are losing tens of thousands of dollars every weekend. We re basically going broke,  said a spokesperson on behalf of Southern Helicopter when approached for comment by NBC Nightly News.  We were not expecting him to come down almost every weekend. But that s exactly what Trump is doing.Instead of working for the American people, Trump would rather spend his weekends playing golf and throwing lavish parties, and that is taking a toll on the local economy as taxpayers in Palm Beach County have to pony up $1.7 million for extra security when Trump is in town.And just as Trump stiffs his contractors when he owes them money, Trump is stiffing Palm Beach County after they asked the White House to reimburse the massive costs.Stellar Aviation Group president Jonathan Miller told NBC that his business is losing $30,000 every weekend when Trump is in town. He fears his business will fold if Trump doesn t halt his trips soon.Here s the video via NBC.This is yet another example of Trump only caring about himself. He is selfishly vacationing every weekend at taxpayer expense and it doesn t matter to him that local business owners are struggling to remain afloat as long as he gets to party and golf.NBC noted that Trump promised to  rarely leave the White House  during the campaign, and pointed out his hypocrisy since he often whined about President Obama s vacations.So Trump is a liar and a hypocrite who is making the local Palm Beach economy suffer.Americans should be outraged by this. How can Trump claim that he is creating jobs when he constant vacations in Palm Beach alone are threatening to cause many people to lose their livelihoods. Trump should be ashamed of himself and America should demand their wasted tax dollars back.Featured image via screenshot",News,6-Mar-17
 Trump Spokeswoman Awkwardly Admits She Has No F*cking Clue What Makes Him Think Obama Tapped His ‘Wires’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s surrogates are desperately trying to defend him after he leveled some pretty serious charges at President Obama based on what he read in a far-Right propaganda rag. According to The Donald, President Obama ordered the  wires  at Trump Tower  tapped.  He provided no evidence, of course, but White House officials confirm that The Donald got his  information  from Breitbart. However, it doesn t seem that his surrogates want to admit where he gets what he thinks are facts.On Monday, Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did her best to defend Trump. The president firmly believes the Obama administration may have tapped into the phones at Trump Tower,  Sanders told  Today  anchor Savannah Guthrie. And is that based on media reports?  Guthrie asked, referencing the Breitbart piece that had been circulating among Trump s staff just before his Twitter outburst. This is something we should look into, we d like to know for sure,  Sanders replied.  Look, the media has been extremely dismissive of this reporting and this potential story, while all the while being very happy to jump on all of the false attacks that have been launched at this president over the last six months. Just so we re clear on this one, specific point   is his information, that President Obama tapped his phone, based solely on something he read in the media?  Guthrie pressed. Look, I haven t had the chance to have that conversation directly with the president,  Sanders said.  He s got much higher classification than I [do], so he may have access to the documents that I don t know about. But I do know that we take this very seriously, and we think it should be thoroughly reviewed and investigated. But, of course, level of classification does not matter because the information came from a report by an outlet that serves as  the platform for the alt-right  (alt-right is the soft term for  Nazis ) according to White House chief strategist Steve Bannon when he was head honcho of the publication. Worse yet, the claim was based on the words of a known conspiracy theorist who now admits he can t back his allegations. But, like Trump, he says he really wants to know if Obama did tap Trump Tower s  wires. Despite the complete lack of evidence, Trump demanded that Republicans investigate Obama   and they say they will. Anything to distract from the very real problem of the Trump administration s troubling ties with Russia, right?Watch the exchange below: Is that the source of this information? Strictly from media reports & not from any other source?  @savannahguthrie asks @SarahHuckabee pic.twitter.com/8JKCVBwzc6  TODAY (@TODAYshow) March 6, 2017Featured image via screengrab",News,6-Mar-17
 ‘Cards Against Humanity’ Maker Has Amazingly Annoying Way To Force GOPers To Hold Town Halls,"Cards Against Humanity has to be one of the best card games ever. Also, its creator is likely one of the most creative human beings of our time. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that this individual, Max Temkin, would have a rather interesting way of contacting his Senator. Said Senator happens to be Ron Johnson (R-WI).Instead of letters, Temkin is sending potatoes to Senator Johnson. Each has a simple message:  Hold a Town Hall.  There is a very good reason for Temkin s going after Johnson specifically. The Senator threatened to have a veteran arrested if he persisted in his requests to hold a conversation with Johnson in person. The constituent, Earl Good, told local station Channel 58 the following of his efforts: The reason I reached out to Ron Johnson, I disagreed with several of the cabinet appointments that were made, and I was concerned about the Affordable Care Act, privatizing the veteran s administration, the Russian hacking. After he repeatedly tried and failed to speak to his Senator, Good received a cease and desist letter barring him from calling or visiting the premises of any of Johnson s offices.To that end, Temkin s campaign against Johnson was born. For just five dollars, you, too, can have a potato sent to Johnson for his horrible treatment of this constituent who so bravely served our nation in war. Here is Temkin s tweet, complete with a website where you can help with the avalanche of potatoes coming Johnson s way:Senator @RonJohnsonWI is a coward. Please send him a potato for $5: https://t.co/oBAjRrc2TF pic.twitter.com/aWjgtYK15B  Max Temkin (@MaxTemkin) March 3, 2017Temkin and his team further explain their efforts in a blog post on the Cards Against Humanity website:Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) is refusing to hold a town hall meeting with his constituents. When one of his voters, a Vietnam veteran, called his office asking for a town hall, Johnson sent him a cease and desist letter.Legally, we re not allowed to call Senator Johnson a cruel idiot who doesn t understand how health insurance works. But we are allowed to mail thousands of potatoes to his office demanding that he listen to his constituents and hold a town hall meeting.For only $5, you can send a potato with your name on it to Senator Ron Johnson s office demanding that he hold a town hall meeting.Of course, Johnson is just the latest Republican who is being a coward and refusing to do his job and meet with constituents. The man is a disgrace. The least we can do is send him a potato. I think I ll head on over there and do it right now.Featured image via Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images",News,6-Mar-17
 GOP Congressman DEMANDS The Federal Government Be Purged Of Anybody Who Disagrees With Trump,"One of the House of Representatives  more crazy members, Steve King, is fully on board Trump s train no matter how outlandish or insane he gets. In fact, Steve King thinks the government needs to be  purged of all dissenters    by which he means anybody who deviates from Trump s (often-changing) beliefs. An article appeared on the Conservative Review about this, and it s obvious that King believes the only way we can move forward is to purge everyone from the White House who doesn t likewise march in lockstep with the Trump train.The first paragraph of that ridiculous story says: At this point in the Obama administration, the newly-minted messiah had full control over every nook and cranny of the executive branch. There was not one morsel of dissent, much less sabotage percolating through the ranks of former GOP presidential appointees within the deep state of the various departments. Fast forward eight years and President Trump is at the cusp of losing control over his presidency if he doesn t immediately fire all of the Obama appointees. This is evidently something on which Steve King, an actual U.S. Representative, believes too. Otherwise why would he tweet the following:@RealDonaldTrump needs to purge Leftists from executive branch before disloyal, illegal & treasonist acts sink us. https://t.co/o1DYtgA7aL  Steve King (@SteveKingIA) March 6, 2017Leftists are disloyal why, Congressman King? Because they don t march in lockstep with Trump like you do? With Vladimir Putin, despite the fact that Russia is our enemy? And here we thought Republicans actually believed in freedom, including the freedom to, you know, have different ideas about stuff. First off, the Obama administration had plenty of dissent within its ranks. For instance, Congressional Democrats held Obama s former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, responsible for certain parts of the ACA that didn t pass Congress.Others strongly disagreed with how Obama was handling Syria. So,  Not one morsel of dissent?  OH PLEASE! Obama was not the dictator conservatives tried to brainwash into thinking he was.As evidence of that, we have Steve King, who s one of the worst right-wingers we ever elected to Congress. Republicans are supposed to support freedom, including freedom of anyone and everyone to disagree with the  president.  In this case, it s Trump, who lost the popular vote. King s ideas are the opposite of freedom   in fact, the support fascism, dictatorships, and even monarchies based on the antithesis of American freedom.Trump should welcome dissent   it would prevent tunnel vision and help him determine a course of action that s truly beneficial to the entire country. Instead, he s a dictator who only cares about how many agree with him and are willing to puff him up. King is one of those who would rather puff Trump up than do what s right for freedom and the country. If nothing else, calling for a purge of dissenters from the White House should disqualify him from every government job he ll ever hold.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,6-Mar-17
" DESPERATE: Trump Doubles Down On Wiretap Lie, Says He Will ‘Be Proven Right’","Usually, if you re in a hole you stop digging but not Donald Trump. The amateur president went on a tweetstorm yesterday, likely to deflect from his own scandals, to accuse Barack Obama of having his phones tapped during the campaign. Trump s newest conspiracy theory isn t going down well. Even Director James Comey asked the Justice Department to publicly reject Trump s claims. That Comey. The one who interfered with the election process by sending a letter to Congress suggesting that there was something the FBI had on Hillary Clinton. As it happens, it was all a ruse to help defeat Trump s Democratic opponent. We re sure Comey is rethinking his actions now.Still yet, Trump is doubling down on his fact-free conspiracy theory.The Hill reports:The CEO of Newsmax Media, known for having a relationship with President Trump, wrote on Sunday that Trump insists he will be proven right regarding his allegation of wiretaps at Trump Tower. I spoke with the President twice yesterday about the wiretap story. I haven t seen him this pissed off in a long time,  Christopher Ruddy wrote in an article for Newmax. When I mentioned Obama  denials  about the wiretaps, he shot back:  This will be investigated, it will all come out. I will be proven right,  he said.Again, there is zero proof of Trump s claims and a President cannot authorize a wiretap in this manner. Trump supporters, even CEOs, believe whatever the alleged president says. We re still waiting for Trump s team of investigators to get back from Hawaii to prove that Obama, America s first black president, did not legitimately hold the highest seat in the land. Trump dogged former president Barack Obama for years. He then went on to accuse Hillary Clinton of corruption. In both instances, Donald Trump was practicing projection which is something he now excels at.Photo by Jim Lo Scalzo   Pool/Getty Images.",News,5-Mar-17
" BREAKING: Republicans Embrace Trump’s Lies, Will Investigate ‘Campaign Surveillance’ As Part Of Russia Probe","On Sunday, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said that the House Intelligence Committee will investigate any alleged surveillance of political parties as part of its investigation into Russian interference in the election, according to The Hill. It s no surprise that Nunes is investigating alleged president Donald Trump s lie that Barack Obama had his phone wires tapped during the campaign. In late February, Nunes, who served as a member of Trump s transition team, resisted calls for his House committee to investigate alleged contacts between Trump associates and Russia. And now, he s going to investigate a baseless accusation from Trump in which the amateur president has offered no proof. Put a Benghazi in front of it, and former President Barack Obama will be investigated ad nauseum. One of the focus points of the House Intelligence Committee s investigation is the U.S. government s response to actions taken by Russian intelligence agents during the presidential campaign,  Nunes said in a statement. As such, the Committee will make inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political party s campaign officials or surrogates, and we will continue to investigate this issue if the evidence warrants it,  he added.The Hill reports:The statement comes hours after White House press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted Trump s request for Congress to include his wiretapping claims in the Russia probe.A spokesman for Obama denied that the former president or any White House official ordered surveillance of the then-president-elect. It s also not within a President s power to order surveillance. It goes to a judge first and through the proper channels.Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, recently joined ranking member Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) in laying out the parameters for the investigation into Russia s cyber activities, including links between Russia and any U.S. campaign officials.It s well documented by U.S Intelligence agencies that Russian President Vladimir Putin called for an influence campaign in an effort to help Trump win the White House. And Trump won. Trump still sings the praises of the Russian leader who is known for having his critics murdered.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News,5-Mar-17
 UNPRECEDENTED: FBI Asks DOJ To Confirm Trump Lied About ‘Wiretaps’ (DETAILS),"Following a series of unhinged tweets from Trump that accuse Obama of illegally spying on him during the election cycle, the intelligence community and the rest of the country have been in an uproar. Many are screaming for him to release his evidence or shut the hell up, and he appears unable to handle the growing scandal around him. But the FBI is doing something else. Director James Comey actually asked the Justice Department to publicly reject Trump s claims.Or, put another way, Comey just asked the DOJ to openly state that Trump lied to the American people.Comey says that the claim is false and must be corrected, and he would know because it was his agency that sought the warrant authorizing wiretapping from the FISA court. The FISA court granted the warrant back in October, after previously refusing to grant it over the summer. Comey is angry because Trump s claims suggest that the FBI broke the law.This is unprecedented   it s the FBI director issuing a public rebuke to a sitting president. The White House, however, isn t backing down because they don t back down on anything. Once Trump says something, the White House goes through all sorts of bizarre gyrations to back him up. We get that it s bad for White House spokespeople, aides and senior staff to contradict their boss, but this is ridiculous. This is something on which they should know better.While the DOJ has yet to actually issue a statement saying anything at all, it seems that this is something Trump can no longer handle. One of the rogue government accounts, Rogue POTUS Staff, says that Trump actually seems to be traumatized by the unfolding scandal   he can t cope with it at all:We re not making light of anything. POTUS seems actually traumatized by recent spate of Russiagate coverage. He can t cope right now.  Rogue POTUS Staff (@RoguePOTUSStaff) March 5, 2017In the end, it doesn t really matter if he s unable to cope with an unfolding scandal the size of Watergate (or big enough to blow Watergate out of the sky). He lied to the public, and the FBI and DOJ both need to publicly say so, along with including the recordings from the taps in their investigations.Photo of James Comey by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.

 White House Officials CONFIRM: Trump Got His Story About Obama Tapping His ‘Wires’ Directly From Breitbart,"Donald Trump has access to a wealth of information as President, but seems content relying on Breitbart and other slimy right-wing propaganda mills as the sole source of what he thinks are facts. Recently, The Donald dissolved into a complete mess after a Breitbart article began circulating among his staff that claimed Obama tapped Trump Tower s  wires    something the President, no matter whom it is, can not do. To clear up the confusion, CNN s Jake Tapper reached out to Trump administration officials, and it turns out that, yes, the situation is just as stupid as it seems. Donald Trump did get his  news  from Breitbart, not the wealth of government information to which he has access. WH officials with whom I spoke said POTUS got the info about wiretap from media   Breitbart, Levin   not from govt sources,  Tapper tweeted Sunday.WH officials with whom I spoke said POTUS got the info about wiretap from media   Breitbart, Levin   not from govt sources.

WH call for Congress to find evidence of POTUS claim with  no further comment  is not proof,  Tapper says, adding that he has requested an interview with President Obama to clear the matter up (which totally needs to happen and promises to be hilarious).Journalists are not alone in being baffled by Trump s ridiculous claim that the former President ordered a wiretap which, once again, he could not do. On Sunday, vocal Obama opponent Marco Rubio said he has no idea where Trump s claim comes from either. I m not sure what it is he is talking about,  Rubio says.  Perhaps the President has information that is not yet available to us or to the public. And if it s true, obviously we re going to find out very quickly. And if it isn t, then obviously he ll have to explain what he meant by it. Unfortunately, as Tapper notes, the information wasn t a closely-held government secret. It was the result of the ravings of a known far-Right conspiracy theorist who has admitted he doesn t even have the evidence to back his claims; he just wants to see Obama investigated.President Obama should do the interview. He s so past the point of caring what these idiots think that it should be hilarious.Featured image via Getty Images",News,5-Mar-17
 Trump Lost His Damn Mind Over The Sessions Recusal For Exactly ONE GIANT Reason,"Trump lost his marbles on Friday, letting loose on his senior staff over Jeff Sessions recusing himself from any and all Department of Justice investigations into Russia. It s kind of strange   the investigations should go forward properly regardless of who s in charge. Or would they? Trump may not have thought so until Sessions recused himself and put Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente, an Obama appointee, in charge of those investigations.Boente gives the Senate Judiciary Committee powerful leverage to demand a special prosecutor now, because Trump s nominee for Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, will have his confirmation hearings this month. The Judiciary Committee could press him to commit to appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Trump and Russia before voting to send his confirmation to the full Senate.If they manage to do that, Russia will probably blow up. If they don t manage to do that, it s possible that the Judiciary Committee won t vote to send Rosenstein to the full Senate, which leaves Boente in charge. The kicker is that Boente, as an Obama appointee, is less likely to fall under Trump s influence.There s historical precedence for the Judiciary Committee to demand such a commitment from a nominee of a corrupt president, too. In 1973, during the unfolding Watergate scandal, Nixon nominated his former Secretary of Defense, Elliot Richardson, for Attorney General. The Judiciary Committee not only demanded Richardson commit to a special prosecutor for Watergate, they demanded he name the person he d appoint before they would vote on his confirmation.Richardson did, and both he and his pick, Archibald Cox, were grilled on just how independent Cox would be in pursuing Watergate.Richardson was confirmed, Cox was appointed, and then Nixon began pressuring Richardson to fire Cox because Cox was getting too close to the truth.What happened with Nixon, Richardson, Cox, and the entire Watergate scandal, are why we need a special prosecutor with broad independent authority now. Trump has accused Obama of illegally wiretapping him, yet apparently, the FBI was able to get a FISA warrant for such tapping back in October. That means there are recordings that are not illegal. Those recordings probably contain damning evidence and need to be investigated, if not outright released.Trump s ire suggests that he s terrified of what those recordings, along with other mounting evidence, will reveal. The more damning those recordings, the more he ll play the victim and act like everything would be just fine if Obama s FBI had just left him and his campaign alone.Maybe Trump thought Sessions would prevent all of this. After all, Sessions lied to the Senate about his own contact with Russia while working on Trump s campaign as a top foreign policy adviser. Or maybe he just thought Sessions would resist calls to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the growing Russia scandal and do it himself, under direction from Trump himself.Trump projects endlessly. Every accusation he levels is something of which he, himself, is either guilty or afraid. In this case, it s likely fear. Besides Sessions, disgraced National Security Adviser, General Michael Flynn, lied about contact with Russia. Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was present for some of that. Two of Trump s other campaign advisers, Carter Page and J.D. Gordon, likewise had contact with Russia. Paul Manafort, who had a brief stint as Trump s campaign manager, has business dealings with pro-Russia leaders in Ukraine.And yet, the Trump administration has vehemently denied any contacts with Russia at all during the campaign, while also saying that contact was brief, fleeting, informal, and innocuous. If so, then why lie like this? Trump s frightened as hell right now. A DOJ under an Obama appointee could easily be his undoing, and he knows it.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,5-Mar-17
 Man Behind Trump’s Insane Claim That Obama Tapped His ‘Wires’ Just Admitted He Made Sh*t Up (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is now demanding that any probe into his administration s connections to Russia also include a probe into his wild allegation that President Obama tapped his  wires  in Trump Tower. This dubious claim seems to have originated with a Breitbart article that had been circulating among White House staff. The article in question claimed that President Obama had ordered a wiretap under the Foreign intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows a secret court to authorize surveillance in cases that involve agents of foreign powers   in this case, Trump and two Russian banks.The article heavily referenced claimed made by conspiracy theorist Mark Levin on his far-Right radio show that  we absolutely know this is true  that Obama was monitoring Trump s team during the campaign. But now that his ridiculous allegations are being scrutinized by people who aren t completely batsh*t insane, Levin is doing everything he can to walk them back while still maintaining credibility with the Stupid Part of America.During an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Levin called for a release of FISA court applications that may or may not exist as well as all of the daily presidential intelligence briefings for the last  year or so.  He added that this massive conspiracy that suddenly popped up when the Russia situation was becoming too much for the Trump Team to handle wasn t limited to Obama. Every single Democrat, according to Levin, was involved in trying to take Trump down.Asked about the level of President Obama s involvement, Levin gave himself a huge  out :I m not Nostradamus here. I just think that we ought to find out.In other words, he is pulling his claims out of thin air. Via a spokesperson, President Obama cleared up his level of involvement on Saturday   There wasn t any. A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,  the spokesman said. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Donald Trump is being attacked for [the accusations] he tweeted,  Levin said, failing to note that he was the source of those allegations.  Donald Trump is the victim, his campaign is the victim, his transition team is the victim, his surrogates are the victim. These are police state tactics. To some degree, Levin is correct   but not in the way he thinks. Trump has recently been demanding investigations of his critics. Members of his administration have also threatened to  investigate  journalists who do not write nice things about The Donald. One Trump administration member confirmed that President Asterisk was compiling  dossiers  on journalists he views as unfriendly. All of these things could very accurately be described as  police state tactics    but we re guessing Levin meant something about his favorite bogeyman, Barack Obama.Levin admits there is no basis for his claim but that doesn t matter to Donald Trump or conservatives at large. By making the allegation knowing that people who can only be described as  idiots  would eat up, the Republicans are demanding answers   and they will not be satisfied with any that do not paint Barack Obama as the monster they have known him to be ever since they realized he was black.Featured image via screengrab",News,5-Mar-17
 Trump Is DELUSIONAL: What He Just Said About His ‘Support’ Rallies Is BEYOND Fantasy (TWEET),"It can easily be said that Donald Trump doesn t live in reality. He lives in his own world filled with delusion and a narrative that he s created on his own. Why? Who knows, really. Maybe because his fragile ego doesn t allow him to see the fact that he lost the popular vote by three million votes and the majority of America doesn t like him at all.Since Trump took office there have been protests nationwide to let him know that both he and his agenda are not welcome. These protests have garnered millions of people outraged and offended that he s in the Oval Office, especially knowing that his campaign allegedly colluded with Russia to put him there.To make his ego feel better, Trump supporters, the vile bunch that they are, decided that they would come out on March 4, and throw  support rallies  for Trump.Let s not forget that this was at his request:Maybe the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN should have their own rally. It would be the biggest of them all!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017So, his supporters listened, jumped on their motorized scooters with American flag decals, and  rallied  for their supreme leader. Then, after a handful of people showed up in a number of places in varying states, Trump decided in his own delusional brain that this was  tremendous support    you know, whatever helps him sleep at night.He wrote on Twitter: Thank you for the great rallies all across the country. Tremendous support. Make America Great Again! Thank you for the great rallies all across the country. Tremendous support. Make America Great Again!  Donald J.

 WATCH: Former Director Of National Intelligence SHREDS Trump Claim That Obama Wiretapped Him,"Donald Trump has absolutely no evidence that President Obama wiretapped him, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper knows it.On Saturday, Trump made wild accusations against President Obama after reading a conspiracy theory on Breitbart.Trump says that Obama illegally wiretapped Trump Tower and compared it to Watergate. On Sunday, Trump demanded that Congress start an investigation against Obama and declared that he would refuse to answer further questions about Russia until they comply.Of course, Trump is clearly trying to distract the media and Congress from investigating the Russia scandal he has been embroiled in for months.While there is plenty of evidence against Trump to justify investigations into his ties to Russia, Trump has offered no proof to back up his accusations against Obama.And if anyone would know about a wiretap against Trump, whether legal or illegal, it would be former National Intelligence Director James Clapper, who served in the position from 2010 until this year.During an interview with Chuck Todd, Clapper flatly denied that President Obama wiretapped Trump.Todd began by asking if he would have been aware of such a wiretap and Clapper shut down the accusation. I would certainly hope so,  Clapper replied.  I will say that the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw   the DNI   there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president   the president-elect at that time or as a candidate   or against his campaign. When asked if other agencies would have requested a FISA court order to wiretap Trump Tower, Clapper said that that s exactly what they would do.In the end, Clapper told Todd that he can clearly deny that President Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower because it did not happen. I can deny it,  Clapper said.Here s the video via Twitter.James Clapper:  There was no such wire tap activity amounted against  Donald Trump. #MTP pic.twitter.com/eNGFKe0vxY  Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) March 5, 2017President Obama should file a lawsuit against Trump. By not providing any evidence of his claims, Trump is slandering President Obama s good name and there should be consequences for these wild unfounded accusations.If Trump is willing to stoop this low to distract from his Russia scandal, then he must be really desperate. That means Congress should be investigating Trump, not Obama.Featured image via screenshot",News,5-Mar-17

 Former Defense Secretary: Trump’s Paranoid Claims ‘Make Us Vulnerable’ To Our Enemies (VIDEO),"Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta explained on Sunday why Donald Trump s paranoid claims that former President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower are so troubling.During an interview with CBS s Face The Nation, the ex-CIA director said that Trump s baseless accusations are dangerous and threaten the safety of the United States. Every time these things happen, every time he tweets, every time these issues come up that indicate that there s obviously something to this Russian issue and the administration is not cooperating,  Panetta said. When that happens, when he accuses a past president of wiretapping without any evidence of that being the case, it makes us vulnerable. It weakens the United States and it makes us vulnerable to our enemies. That s the danger. According to Panetta, Trump is  sending a terrible message out there  and leaders around the world are very concerned. They re concerned about whether he truly is going to be committed to the kind of world leadership that we ve seen the United States provide,  he said.Trump sent out a tweet on Saturday claiming that Obama had his  wires tapped.  He has offered zero evidence for this allegation and U.S. officials have lined up to tell him that he s out of his ever-loving mind and nobody  tapped  his stupid  wires.  But as usual, Trump and his administration have continued to cling to their bogus accusations with a total disregard for the truth.Watch the former secretary of defense explain how Trump is making us more vulnerable to our enemies with his absurdities, here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,5-Mar-17

Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling,  Trump said in a statement issued by the White House. President Donald J. Trump is requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted. If Republicans actually start a witch hunt against President Obama instead of investigating Trump s obvious ties to Russia it will be clear that they are incapable of doing their jobs.Trump literally repeated what he read on Breitbart and now he is desperately hoping that Congress and the media will focus on President Obama instead of the ever-growing Russia scandal he and his administration are embroiled in.The American people should be outraged.Featured Image: Wonkette",News,5-Mar-17
" Conservative Columnist Asks CRUCIAL Question About Trump’s State Of Mind, And We NEED An Answer","The Wall Street Journal is anything but liberal, and most of its columnists are likewise anything but liberal. But this not-at-all liberal publication does have writers, reporters and columnists who can see reality, and one sees the reality of Trump s deteriorating mental state to the point where he actually called it out. Yes, a Wall Street Journal columnist literally went there on the state of Trump s mind.Bret Stephens, the columnist in question, asked Twitter something interesting: When will Republicans acknowledge that the President of the United States is mentally ill? He then linked to a WSJ story about Trump s latest tantrum, which includes accusing former President Obama of wiretapping him during his campaign. He likened the activity to both Watergate and McCarthyism, but failed to produce any evidence. It s illegal for the President of the United States to order wiretaps   in fact, the FISA court (which grants or denies warrants for just such surveillance) very likely would not go along with a presidential  order  to grant a warrant for tapping someone.He also called Obama a  bad (or sick) guy,  for it:How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Trump quickly drew the ire of Republicans and Democrats alike with that, and many are rightfully calling on him to produce his evidence or shut the fuck up. Stephens, fed up, was essentially doing the same thing, but he caught a lot of flak for saying Trump is mentally ill without a degree in psychology or evaluating Trump himself. That perpetuates the stigma against mental illness.Because of that, he later deleted his tweet (but screencaps live forever):The truth is that we do need an answer about Trump s state of mind soon. How stable is Donald Trump? His behavior does suggest a serious problem. There are any number of things that this could be (that may or may not be mental illness), but nobody can address this without knowing what it is.Featured image by Jim Lo Scalzo via Getty Images",News,5-Mar-17
 Democrats Across The Country Are Figuring Out Ways To FORCE Trump To Release His Tax Returns,"Every major party presidential candidate in the last 40 years has released his or her tax returns, except for two. One was Gerald Ford and the other was Donald Trump. Trump, who s completely embroiled in a scandal surrounding ties to Russia, may soon be forced, at court or congressional order, to release his returns, but if that doesn t happen, Democrats at the state level might be forcing Trump s hand.State legislatures are now proposing measures that would ban any candidates from their ballots who don t release tax returns. Tax return information would provide some transparency there to give voters the assurance that they need that the president is acting on behalf of us,  said Kathleen Clyde, an Ohio state representative who recently introduced a version of the bill.  It is problematic that he is the only candidate in 30 or 40 years not to provide that information. Clyde s bill, the Tax Returns Uniformly Made Public Act   the TRUMP Act   would require candidates for president and vice president to disclose five years of tax documents to Ohio s Secretary of State, who would then post the documents online. Only after a candidate disclosed the tax information would he or she qualify for the ballot in one of the nation s most hotly contested battlegrounds.Similar measures requiring candidates to file with Secretary of State offices have been introduced in California, Oregon and Tennessee. Candidates would be required to file tax documents with state boards of election under bills filed in Illinois, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island.Source: The HillSo far, 19 states are considering similar bills and not all of them are blue, but it s probably that only blue states will pass the bills, if at all.Elections, even national elections, are run by the states. Nationally, there are only two qualifications to run for President: The candidate must be at least 35-years-old and must be a natural born citizen. None of the rest matters in the eyes of the law. That s why Trump didn t have to release his tax returns to begin with.However, states have more latitude. For example, in many states, candidates must receive a minimum number of signatures on a petition before being allowed on a ballot, although that typically applies to non-major party candidates. Still, states can impose rules like filing fees and deadlines, although it s still not clear that forcing candidates to release tax returns will pass constitutional muster.Even if this passes in a few states, Trump could still, if he doesn t implode, win reelection if he wins enough red states. In theory, he could win without a single vote in our most populous state (California), as long as he won the Electoral College. Let s hope these bills do pass to prevent a future Trump, but first, let s pressure Congress to force Trump s hand right now.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,5-Mar-17
 Trump Just Told The Military To Do What It Wants In The Middle East,"Is there some specific reason we have someone in the White House who s willing to let the military do what it wants in terms of strikes? On Friday, it was discovered that Trump literally granted our military commanders permission to order attacks in countries that don t have much of an American military presence very shortly after he took over the White House. This means that they can carry out strikes without first having to get approval from the White House, which supposedly has military strategists who know what s going on.The first units to carry out attacks without approval from the White House were, of course, in Yemen. Yemen is where we botched a raid that yielded absolutely nothing and resulted in the death of a Navy SEAL. While that raid didn t fall under this new authority, subsequent operations could result in similar disasters. The new authority, according to The Hill, is intended to accelerate the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (a.k.a. AQAP).Navy Captain Jeff Davis says he doesn t want to telegraph future operations in explaining how this works, but, in short,  this is part of a plan to go after a very real threat, to ensure they are defeated and denied the opportunity to plot and carry out terrorist attacks from ungoverned spaces. Like Yemen? Is Trump allowing them to just do what they want or do they still have to have solid intelligence before they strike? The reason the Yemen raid was such a disaster is because the White House didn t have solid intelligence and they didn t have a solid plan. While it sounds good to turn that authority over to military commanders in the regions we supposedly want to control, the question is, do they have the knowledge they need to succeed in any attacks they decide to carry out?The kicker here is that Trump has given this overarching authority to military commanders in areas where we don t have much of a presence, and therefore, probably don t have much in the way of the intelligence we need to make successful strikes. That means we have to be more careful. Trump doesn t want to be careful. He wants to abdicate a responsibility so he can what play golf and not think about it?It s not that our military commanders are incompetent. Far from it. The problem is letting them act on, well, pretty much anything, despite limited information. It could get us in a ton of trouble with the rest of the world.Featured image by Olivier Douliery via Getty Images",News,5-Mar-17
 ANOTHER Russian With Ties To Trump Just Dropped Dead,"While Donald Trump s team, one by one, is being connected to Russia in secretive and perhaps illegal ways, a story that s going largely unreported in American media is the fact that seven, yes seven, Russian diplomats and businessmen have dropped dead since the American presidential election.Conspiracy theorists are coming up with a lot of answers, and officially, there are a lot of unanswered questions, especially when you take into account Vladimir Putin s habit of (allegedly) killing people. Some have tried (so far unsuccessfully) to draw the line between the deaths and Trump. The latest death, though, is more specifically linked to Donald Trump.The internet found out about the death of Alex Oronov on Saturday. Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo has been following the connection since before Oronov died, but put simply, Oronov is a friend, family member and business associate of Donald Trump s attorney:Last week I wrote about Michael Cohen and his extensive network of personal and business relationships in the Ukrainian-American emigre community. One of those was a man named Alex Oronov, who runs a major agribusiness concern in Ukraine. Oronov was a partner in the ethanol business Cohen and Cohen s brother Bryan set up in Ukraine about a decade ago. Oronov is Bryan Cohen s father-in-law. Today we learned that Oronov apparently organized that  peace plan  meeting that brought together Ukrainian MP Artemenko, Cohen and Felix Sater. About four hours ago Andrii Artemenko, the Ukrainian parliamentarian who came to New York with that  peace plan , went on Facebook to announce that Alex Oronov has died.Cohen, who is describe by Marshall as Trump s  right hand man,  is also involved in business with Trump. He and his family have purchases at least 12 apartments in Trump buildings. Donald Trump Jr. admitted in 2008 that a lot of Trump s assets came from Russia. Cohen may be the facilitator.We know from public records that in the last decade Trump became highly dependent on money from the former Soviet Union, both to finance mega-projects like Trump SoHo but also as a source of buyers of apartment units at Trump high-rises in New York City, Florida and other locales (The Cohen brothers and their families are purchasers of at least 12 apartments in Trump buildings   11, according to a 2006 article in The New York Post and one owned by the Oronovs, according to Florida public records.) Donald Trump, Jr. said famously in 2008 that  Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia .Cohen and his extended family appear to have been part of that flow of luxury apartment purchases from people from the former Soviet Union. And Cohen himself joined the Trump Organization in the period when Trump s reliance on investment capital from the former Soviet Union for projects like Trump Soho moved into high gear.As for Oronov, he is one of four deaths that are connected to Trump. This isn t intended to imply that Trump was involved in their deaths, but there s no doubt that things are getting weirder and weirder every single day.Featured image of Vladimir Putin via Sean Gallup/Getty Images | Featured image of Donald Trump via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,5-Mar-17
 Saturday Night Live Takes On GOP Cowardice In Stunningly Accurate Faux Movie Trailer (VIDEO),"As we all live in the nightmarish hellscape that is the Donald Trump presidency is the fact that Congressional Republicans are flat-out refusing to stand up to Donald Trump s insanity. They know he is mentally unstable, corrupt, incompetent, and dangerous. However, they also are drunk with power while holding every branch of government. If they can get him to be a rubber stamp for their agenda, they don t care about doing what is right for the country. They only care about what they want.Well, there is one show that is not afraid to hammer this unpatriotic and dangerous insanity: Saturday Night Live. In the newest episode of the parody show, the producers came up with a brilliant faux movie trailer entitled  TBD.  It starts by portraying an accurate account of what we are all going through under Trump s regime right now, with phrases like,  a nation divided,  and  a president with unchecked power.  Then, it moves to different scenarios of one brave Republican member of Congress speaking out against the president. In each segment, that person s identity and statements against Trump are  TBD. In the  reviews  segment, it even takes a shot of infamously spineless House Speaker Paul Ryan when its Rolling Stone  review  says: it s definitely NOT about Paul Ryan. This is awesomely funny, but it s also chillingly accurate. Oh, if only SNL could shame the GOP into doing what is right.Watch the video below:Courage, Compassion, Country: The TBD Story.

This is especially true when the subject of said covers is Donald Trump.

We can no longer afford to ignore a very important fact: The man currently occupying the Oval Office is dangerously unhinged. His behavior becomes more outrageous and erratic every day. He lies pathologically, peddles conspiracy theories, threatens the free press, decries any story he doesn t like as  fake news,  and holds his officials hostage and forces them to lie repeatedly to the American public as well.There have been some brave souls in Congress who have openly questioned the president s mental stability   most notably Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA). However, the Democrats are not in control, so they can do nothing to put safeguards in place to keep Trump s instability from endangering the nation even more than he has already. So, it s time for the GOP to step up and put country before party, and admit that they know that Donald Trump is stark raving mad and has no business being president.Until then, thank you journalists at papers like the New York Daily News for speaking truth to power. It just might be the Fourth Estate that saves us after all.Featured image via Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images",News,4-Mar-17
 ‘Go Back To Your Own Country’: Right-Wing Bigot Shoots Man In Fit Of Anti-Immigrant Rage,"Donald Trump s presidency has inspired many bigot to come out of the woodwork and commit acts of violence against those they perceive as not belonging in  their  country. The latest incidence of this was the case of a man of the Sikh faith who lives outside Seattle, Washington in the town of Kent, being shot in his own driveway by a man who told him to  go back to [your] own country. The victim is a 39-year-old man who was working on his car in his yard, minding his own business. According to the Washington Post, a stranger approached the man unprovoked. He was reportedly clad in a mask and was carrying a loaded gun. The criminal is described as a white male, roughly six feet tall. When he invaded the man s property, some kind of confrontation ensued, and then the man told the victim,  go back to your own country,  before shooting said victim in the arm.The name of the victim has not been given to the press, and the perpetrator is still at large. Kent police are considering that this is a possible hate crime.Kent police chief says dept. is investigating last night's shooting as a possible hate crime against member of Sikh community. pic.twitter.com/pLcWsobvm4  Ryan Takeo (@RyanTakeoK5) March 4, 2017This act of violence also comes on the heels of two Indian men being shot by a white man with similar anti-immigrant sentiments, with one of them being killed. Another man was also wounded when he tried to stop the murderous act.Anyone who thinks this has nothing to do with Donald Trump s hateful rhetoric is deluded at this point. Trump s own hatred, and blatant appeals to white supremacists and other fringe bigots has emboldened the worst and the most violent among us. He has given them permission to openly hate again, and they are acting on it, full stop. Donald Trump and his followers are literally getting people killed. He and his administration have blood on their hands, but of course they will never admit it.Featured image via Yana Paskova/Getty Images",News,4-Mar-17
 GOP Rep Asks Muslim High School Students: ‘Do You Beat Your Wife?’ (VIDEO),"A GOP lawmaker in Oklahoma raised more than a few eyebrows when before speaking to a group of Muslim high school students, he presented them with a questionnaire that represented the worst about Islamophobia. He even asked them,  Do you beat your wife? In Oklahoma, there s an annual Muslim Day at the Capitol, which is hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Students from Tulsa s private school for Muslims called the Peace Academy wanted to visit the office of Rep. John Bennett, but before he would meet with them, they were supposed to fill out a questionnaire from a hate group.That s according to Adam Soltani, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Oklahoma, who posted a video to Facebook shortly after the incident occurred Thursday. I just have been informed by some of our community members that Rep. John Bennett   who in my opinion, at this point, doesn t even deserve to be called a representative   is refusing to meet with Muslims unless they answer questions from an Islamophobic hate group called Act For America,  Soltani said in the video.Source: Huffington PostHere s some of the questionnaire:Here s the video by Adam Soltani:Bennett hasn t responded, but even beyond the fact that this is a bigoted questionnaire, this was directed at high school students!While it s tempting to blame this on Donald Trump, the hate enabler, Bennett has been on the hate train for quite a while. In 2014, he denied that there were moderate Muslims and said that 90 percent of Islam is violent.Here s that video:Bennett, it seems, should be reminded that the vast majority of victims of terrorists are themselves Muslim. In this country, Muslims are far more likely to be victims of terrorism (hate crimes) than to initiate terrorism, but we ll never hear that from the occupant of the White House. Instead, Republicans will just spread the idea that high school students might beat their wives.Featured image via video screen capture",News,4-Mar-17
" Lindsey Graham DEFENDS Obama, Drops BOMBSHELL On Trump That Will Destroy Him (VIDEO)","Donald Trump is getting more screwed over by the Republicans as the days go on. They had originally wanted to use him to advance the GOP s motives, but now that they see how batsh*t crazy he is, many conservatives want nothing to do with him.We saw a perfect example of this on Saturday morning, when GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham condemned Trump s latest Twitter meltdown, and it was absolutely brutal. Graham basically stood behind former President Barack Obama and trashed Trump for accusing the last respectable POTUS of wiretapping his phones in the Trump Tower before the election.Graham has previously spoken out against Trump, and has rarely minced his words when warning Americans about the loose cannon we now have in the White House. In the town hall, Graham blatantly stated that what Trump was alleging might end up being the biggest scandal we ve seen in decades. Graham said: The President of the United States is claiming that the former President of the United States ordered wiretapping of his campaign last year. I don t know if it s true or not, but if it is true, illegally, it would be the biggest political scandal since Watergate. This statement was met with shouts and screams, and Graham had to beg the rowdy crowd to settle down so he could continue. Offering another take on what Trump had done, he said: If the former President of the United States was able to obtain a warrant lawfully to monitor the Trump campaign for violating law, that would be the biggest scandal since Watergate. Graham went on, explaining that Trump had just done himself a MAJOR disservice, and his Twitter meltdown may have very serious consequences. I m very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegal. I would be very worried if, in fact, the Obama Administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with foreign governments. This would hardly be the first time Trump s pathetic attempt to make someone look bad backfired.

 Pence Does His Best Trump Impression; DEMANDS Apology From AP Over Email Story (DETAILS),"Donald Trump s number two man, Mike Pence, has largely been seen as the antithesis to Trump s erratic, bombastic, authoritarian style of governing. However, Pence is crazy in his own way. He s a theocrat who wants to usher in mandatory Evangelical Christianity and force it upon all Americans. What s really scary is that he is so quiet about it that most people don t know what kind of monster Pence really is until they do a bit of research and discover his horrifying beliefs. Well, all that may be changing, and we might have the Associated Press to thank for it.By now, everyone knows that it turns out that while he was Governor of Indiana, Pence used a private AOL email address to conduct sensitive government business   and the email was actually hacked. This is amazingly hypocritical, considering the fact that Republicans everywhere   including Trump and Pence, of course   hammered Hillary Clinton relentlessly, and even had their crowds screaming  LOCK HER UP!    all for doing the exact same thing that Pence has just been caught doing. The hypocrisy here defies description.The plot of the whole thing thickens, because it appears that the AP repeatedly asked for transcripts of Pence s secret emails that were not released to the public. As a result, in the story of Pence s email scandal, Pence s wife, Karen Pence, had her private email address published. This, of course, has Pence beside himself with rage. He is now trying to bully the AP into an apology, Trump-style.Mark Paoletta, Pence s White House counsel, sent the following directive to the AP: The publication of Mrs. Pence s active private email address to millions of your readers has subjected her to vitriolic and malicious emails and raised serious security concerns. There was absolutely no reason to publish this private email address and you should be ashamed of your reprehensible contact. Your organization should apologize to Mrs. Pence for violating her privacy, and the Associated Press should observe the basic tenets of fairness, decency and journalistic integrity and covering the Vice President, Mrs. Pence and their family in the future. Here is Pence s belligerent tweet, with the entire letter included:When we requested they take it down, they refused. The @AP owes my wife an apology. pic.twitter.com/LdMmnewnWF  Vice President Pence (@VP) March 4, 2017This is REALLY rich, considering that Trump tweeted out Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) s personal cell phone number during the campaign, all because Graham dared to criticize Trump. Pence really has no moral high ground regarding anything resembling decency, considering that he is in bed with The Donald, especially on these sorts of matters.As for the AP, they are being good, tough checks on these bullies, and have refused to remove Karen Pence s email address from the original. As a consolation, though, they did omit the address from further writings on the subject of the Pence email situation, according to spokeswoman Laura Easton, who says,  AP removed the email address from subsequent stories after learning Mrs. Pence still used the account. This is all Pence s fault, anyway, because according to the AP, the story only ran because Pence: repeatedly stonewalled media requests to view public records when he was Indiana s governor, including emails about state business distributed from a private AOL account that was hacked last year. This is really getting ridiculous, these threats to the press every time a story this incompetent, chaotic administration doesn t like drops. They are corrupt, vindictive, malicious, and likely engaged in criminal activity.Keep the pressure on, journalists. They re cracking.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,4-Mar-17
 ‘Lunatic’: Huge Backlash From Lawmakers After Trump’s ‘Wiretap’ Accusations,"Reality show star turned  so-called  president Donald Trump alleged in a tweetstorm this morning that former President Barack Obama had Trump Tower s  wires tapped  before the election. The only place Trump could have gotten that disinformation is from fake news  site Breitbart.com. Trump has some  splainin  to do over that conspiratorial tweet. Like, for example, what the f*ck he s talking about. For sure, former President Barack Obama has no idea what Trump what Trump is referring to.Trump called Obama  bad  or  sick  during his tweet frenzy, all while offering no proof to back up his jaw-dropping claims.Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, which is also probing the scope of Russia s influence on the US election, said in a statement Saturday afternoon in regards to one of Trump s tweets this morning,  If there is something bad or sick going on, it is the willingness of the nation s chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them. No matter how much we hope and pray that this President will grow into one who respects and understands the Constitution, separation of powers, role of a free press, responsibilities as the leader of the free world, or demonstrates even the most basic regard for the truth, we must now accept that President Trump will never become that man,  Schiff said.Trump s baseless accusations backfired.

Jim Himes (@jahimes) March 4, 2017It s not just Democrats. GOP Sen. Ben Sasse said on Saturday that Trump owes the public a further explanation of his bizarre allegation against Obama. The president today made some very serious allegations, and the informed citizens that a republic requires deserve more information,  Sasse said, according to Politico.  If without [an authorization], the President should explain what sort of wiretap it was and how he knows this. It is possible that he was illegally tapped. But Sasse added that there are legalities to a wiretap. If it was with a legal FISA court order, then an application for surveillance exists that the court found credible. The president should ask that this full application regarding surveillance of foreign operatives or operations be made available, ideally to the full public, and at a bare minimum to the U.S. Senate,  Sasse said.Maybe if Trump released his tax returns, we could learn more.

 BREAKING: Trump Tops Off INSANE Weekend By Announcing A New Muslim Ban,"Donald Trump s most dangerous and offensive campaign promise was, of course, his call for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  We all saw that plan realized in late January, as Trump rolled out the ban via a chaotic Executive Order that the courts quickly struck down. Well, it seems that Trump has not given up just yet, and plans to sign a brand new Muslim ban this coming Monday.In preparation, Trump s white supremacist Chief Strategist Steve Bannon will go down to Mar-A-Lago for the weekend, along with others from the Department of Justice, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to be with Trump. The festivities at the posh resort will include an  EO launch meeting. This comes after Trump s team decided to let Trump s ego be stroked by the good press he was getting from his address to a joint session of Congress. However, this didn t last, thanks to the controversy surrounding Jeff Sessions and his lying to Congress about his contacts with Russians.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has already responded, and they are definitely ready to combat Trump s bigotry in the courts. They tweeted:We're ready. See you in court (again), @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/TeNPcwZNdk  ACLU National (@ACLU) March 4, 2017What is really sick about all of this is that this insanity is ratcheting up hateful sentiment toward the groups of people that Team Trump fixates on.

 Trump Went ‘BALLISTIC’ When Sessions Recused Himself From Russia Investigation,"Donald Trump reportedly flew into a fit of rage when Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided to recuse himself from the investigation into Russia.Sessions resigned on Thursday after it was revealed that he had met with the Russian ambassador and then lied about it during his confirmation hearing. Sessions made the choice after officials at the Justice Department advised him to recuse himself, but Trump didn t take the news well at all.Robert Costa, a reporter for the Washington Post, tweeted that Trump stormed out of the White House in a fury  on Friday,  fuming about [Jeff] Sessions recusal and telling aides that Sessions shouldn t have recused himself. Trump left WH in a fury on Friday, fuming about Sessions s recusal and telling aides that Sessions shouldn t have recused himself  Robert Costa (@costareports) March 4, 2017President remarked to staff that Sessions/WH/DOJ should have done more to counter Sessions story, that it was  bull,  per aides familiar  Robert Costa (@costareports) March 4, 2017According to ABC News, Trump went absolutely  ballistic  when he found out that Sessions was going to recuse himself.Before leaving for Mar-a-Lago yesterday, Pres. Trump summoned some senior staff to the Oval Office and went  ballistic,  sources tell @ABC.  Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) March 4, 2017Trump expressed his full support of Sessions just hours before the attorney general announced that he was recusing himself from the investigation. Trump has defended Sessions unwaveringly and continues to dismiss the accusations against him.Trump s reaction isn t exactly surprising. At this point, more people close to him have met with Russia (and lied about it) than haven t. Chances are slim to none that Trump himself wasn t involved. As the investigation continues, evidence keeps mounting up and the list of Trump officials who have been in contact with Russia continues to grow.Trump s former national security adviser was forced to resign after it was revealed he told Russia not to worry about the sanctions imposed by President Obama  before Trump was sworn in. In recent days, Trump s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has also been caught meeting with Flynn and the Russian ambassador.Featured image via Jim Lo Scalzo   Pool/Getty Images",News,4-Mar-17
" ‘March 4 Trump’ Gets HILARIOUSLY Bad Turnout, Demonstrating Trump’s Lack Of Public Support (IMAGES)","One would think that conservatives would have figured out by now that they can t get people to turn out for their marches and protests. That seems to be especially true with Trump in office. So many more people are against him than for him, yet these delusional Trumpkins still think they re some kind of majority in this country.Witness their enthusiasm for today s March 4 Trump. It was supposed to be a counter to the Women s March on Washington that happened all over the world the day after Trump s inauguration. The Women s March drew well more than two million people just in the U.S. The March 4 Trump must have been overwhelming then, given all that support Trump and his loyal subjects think they have.And overwhelming these marches were, in their own way   the lack of support they showed for Trump is actually what was overwhelming. Most of these protests drew dozens, rather than the thousands they seemed to think they were going to get. For instance, in Orlando, roughly 200 people showed up, compared to the 5,000 that showed up in January for the Women s March.Denver had just dozens, where 145,000 had marched in January. In our nation s capital, Trumpers were hoping that they could draw more than half a million, which would rival the Women s March there. They drew a few thousand at best, despite Trump s claim that marches for him would be the biggest marches of all:Here at the yuge rally for Trump at the White House pic.twitter.com/aJ5gcMicyr  Brian Tashman (@briantashman) March 4, 2017The #TrumpTrain is in town and standing strong for @POTUS.I will be articulating the case for #Trump shortly, friends.#March4Trump pic.twitter.com/zdH682s7Vk  Michael Johns (@michaeljohns) March 4, 2017Here s the march at Trump Tower in New York City:Literally the March 4 Trump pic.twitter.com/Of8vChB8NQ  Eric Grant (@ericgrant) March 4, 2017Small crowd at the March 4 Trump. pic.twitter.com/LxPMcYtBO3  Eric Grant (@ericgrant) March 4, 2017Crowds were just as pathetic elsewhere, too:#March4Trump draws about 200 people to Voinovich Park, plus about 100 counter protestors pic.twitter.com/Jfq3GL05ar  Kabir Bhatia (@KabirBhatiaTime) March 4, 2017#NoMorein614 march in Columbus, OH. #BlackLivesMatter #NoBanBoWall #organizeCBUS #JaronThomas @614Unity @soit_goes @marymad @OhioPJP pic.twitter.com/du1EdboKfd  SURJ Columbus (@SURJColumbusOH) March 4, 2017At #March4Trump rally in Springfield,IL pic.twitter.com/WFvZLkSn25  James B (@JebLadat) March 4, 2017We are live from Denver where black bloc is confronting March 4 Trump DPD ready with police tape line https://t.co/RxJlYm2jkM pic.twitter.com/2817ZMkUq4  Unicorn Riot (@UR_Ninja) March 4, 2017A better view of just how empty the Plaza is for this pro-Trump rally.

 Obama Just CRUSHED Trump’s Delusional Claim That He Ordered Trump Tower’s ‘Wires Tapped’,"Real-life Saturday morning cartoon villain Donald Trump kicked off his day with a delusional rant about President Obama. In what appears to be a effort to shift focus away from the fact that his administration has more ties to Russia than a Moscow bondage club by leveling some rather interesting accusations at the right wing s favored bogeyman. Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my  wires tapped  in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Trump tweeted after reading that it s totally true on white supremacist propaganda mill Breitbart.  Is it legal for a sitting President to be  wire tapping  a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW! I d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!  said Trump, adding that  this is Nixon/Watergate.  While he is correct that this will end for him very much like Watergate did for Nixon, it seems that he might not want to advertise that he was tapped.

As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.

 Congressman Tells Trump He’s In ‘Deep S**t’ If Wiretapping Conspiracy Is True — And He’s Right (DETAILS),"Donald Trump may have just inadvertently admitted guilt during his bizarre and conspiracy riddled claim that President Obama ordered the Trump Tower to be wiretapped.In a flurry of early morning tweets (how s that pivot going, Republicans), President Trump accused President Obama, as early as October, with launching a Nixonian-McCarthy-esque witch hunt against his campaign in order to undermine him.Once again, President Trump has shown a complete lack of understanding about the separation of powers enshrined in the United States Constitution. Contrary to popular (right-wing) belief, the President of the United States does not have the authority to order a wiretapping of an individual s house, phone, or place or business.But don t take our word for it. Let Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu of California explain it:Mr. President: If there was a wiretap at Trump Tower, that means a fed judge found probable cause of crime which means you are in deep shit. https://t.co/i7dUMtHXmo  Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 4, 2017In case that wasn t enough, let him explain it one more time:Either @realDonaldTrump is paranoid like Nixon, or judge found probable cause of crime for #wiretap. Either way our President is in trouble.  Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 4, 2017Lieu is right: either way you look at it, Trump is in trouble. He is either painfully ignorant of the Constitution; has done something that would warrant probable cause (which could be criminal); or both. Our money is on both. He s demonstrated that he completely off his rockers and ill-equipped for the office of the presidency.Even if President Obama did recommend that Trump s phones and buildings be tapped (which is highly unlikely, but if true, THANKS OBAMA!), it certainly wouldn t be without merit. Since August   with the resignation of Paul Manafort, intelligence officials have been looking into whether or not the Trump campaign was in collusion with the Russian government. And over the last several months, many damning revelations have come out about the campaign s contacts, which were previously denied.Maybe the Trump white House should be bugged. Their lack of transparency and honesty has been frightening and beneath the awesome responsibility of the Executive Branch.Maybe this wiretapped information (if it happened) is the information Comey and the FBI is withholding, according to Senator Ron Wyden.Only time will tell.

 Republican Rep Sickeningly Justifies Obamacare Repeal: Poor People Don’t Want Healthcare,"Republicans just keep digging their political graves deeper.The Affordable Care Act currently provides health insurance to 30 million Americans. The plans are broader than ever before and people can t be discriminated against just because they have a pre-existing condition.People who didn t have affordable access to medical care now have it.But Republicans have been trying to take it away from them for years and are still trying to do so even though Americans across the country have made it clear that they support the landmark healthcare law.The latest Republican to desperately try to justify repealing the Affordable Care Act is Kansas Rep. Roger Marshall, who claims the free market provides better and more affordable healthcare while also claiming that poor people don t want healthcare. Just like Jesus said,  The poor will always be with us,  Marshall told STAT News.  There is a group of people that just don t want health care and aren t going to take care of themselves. But Marshall, like most Republicans, is lying.As it turns out, people who gained health insurance through Medicaid expansion are, in fact, using preventive care services to take care of themselves.So saying that poor people don t want healthcare is absolutely ridiculous.But Marshall continued to insist that poor people don t want to take care of themselves. Just, like, homeless people.   I think just morally, spiritually, socially, [some people] just don t want health care. The Medicaid population, which is [on] a free credit card, as a group, do probably the least preventive medicine and taking care of themselves and eating healthy and exercising. And I m not judging, I m just saying socially that s where they are. So there s a group of people that even with unlimited access to health care are only going to use the emergency room when their arm is chopped off or when their pneumonia is so bad they get brought [into] the ER. Again, Medicaid recipients are using preventive services such as mammograms and cholesterol checks by an increase of 60 percent and 20 percent.In addition, Marshall envisions a healthcare system that only the wealthy can afford. In doing so, he based his vision on the hospital he ran before taking office. Our vision was that we would look more like a hotel with customer service that delivered five-star health care,  he said.  So our cafeteria looks more like a coffee shop than it does a sterile hospital dining room. We have bright windows everywhere, and outside of every window there s a garden. Thinking that healing is more than just a knife and a needle. The price of a stay at a five-star hotel can range well into the hundreds upwards to thousands of dollars per night, hardly something a low-income American can afford.While Marshall argues that free market healthcare is more affordable, the facts paint a far different picture.For example, a British couple were on vacation in New York when the woman unexpectedly went into labor 11 weeks early. She gave birth at a private hospital and was slapped with a $200,000 medical bill.The same thing happened to a Canadian woman who was vacationing in Hawaii, only she got slapped with a $1 million medical bill.These are the astronomical prices that Republicans like Marshall think Americans should have to pay. Such prices are financially crippling to low-income Americans, and medical bankruptcy is one of the major reasons why the Affordable Care Act was passed in the first place.Because while Marshall claims that government healthcare is more expensive, had the two women above given birth in their home countries, their care would have been free because Canada and England both have national healthcare services paid for through taxes. Even a private hospital a England would have only cost the British couple $15,000, far lower than the $200,000 bill issued by the kind of  five-star  American hospital Marshall thinks should be the future of healthcare.In short, Republicans don t think poor people should get access to affordable healthcare. They think healthcare is for rich people. That s morally repugnant and is exactly why Republicans should be ousted from office en masse in 2018. This country needs a healthcare system that works for everyone. Republicans are content with just letting people die.Featured image via Flickr",News,4-Mar-17
 Arnold Schwarzenegger HAMMERS Trump For Claiming He Was Fired From ‘Celebrity Apprentice’,"Donald Trump just got terminated again by Arnold Schwarzenegger for lying about him on Twitter.It s no secret that the ratings for Celebrity Apprentice were worse than in previous years. But in those previous years, people weren t boycotting the show either.Millions of Americans have been boycotting anything Donald Trump has his name on, including the reality television show, since the election in November.Trump refuses to separate himself from his various business interests, which are conflicts of interest as it appears he is making decisions in the White House to benefit himself personally. To that end, Trump remained attached to Celebrity Apprentice as a producer, which instantly made the show a prime way to boycott Trump.In other words, Trump really only has himself to blame for the show s demise.Earlier this week, Schwarzenegger announced that he would not be returning to host the show, citing Trump s unpopularity and the fact that viewers and sponsors want nothing to do with a show featuring Trump s name. With Trump being involved in the show people have a bad taste and don t want to participate as a spectator or sponsor or in any other way support the show,  Schwarzenegger said.  It s a very divisive period right now and I think the show got caught up in all that division. So Schwarzenegger left the show voluntarily. That s a fact. But Donald Trump has thin skin, so he attacked Schwarzenegger by claiming he was fired from the show.Arnold Schwarzenegger isn t voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me. Sad end to great show  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Again, Schwarzenegger was not fired. He departed the show on his own terms, and he quickly replied to Trump s bullshit.You should think about hiring a new joke writer and a fact checker. https://t.co/SvAjuPdHfa  Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) March 4, 2017The fact is that Trump only has himself to blame for why Celebrity Apprentice sank in the ratings. He constantly attacked the show on Twitter and at White House events. Keep in mind that Trump was credited as a producer on the show, so he literally trashed his own show. Trump s toxicity also contributed to its downfall as people chose to watch something else rather than help Trump make money.If Trump s name had not been attached to the show, it probably would have done a lot better because people would have tuned in to spite Trump. Instead, NBC made the monumentally stupid decision to let Trump remain as an executive producer rather than fire him and keep him as far away from their programming as possible.Featured Image: Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty Images",News,4-Mar-17
" Photo Of Hillary Reading About Pence’s Private Email Surfaces, And It’s The Most Heartbreaking Thing You’ll See This Week (TWEETS)","You remember that one company that used to stuff your mailbox full of coasters installation discs every single goddamn day of the week, your only reprieve from the madness being Sunday? Well, America Online finally discovered what it takes to be relevant: apparently Mike Pence uses it.On Thursday, the Indianapolis Star revealed that not only did the Vice President use private email   something for which Donald Trump s opponent, Hillary Clinton, was demonized   but he conducted state business on an insecure, almost-forgotten service that was presumed dead long ago. Unlike Hillary Clinton s private email server, Pence s AOL account was hacked.Clinton was spotted on a flight from Boston to New York on Friday and a passenger managed to catch the very moment the former Secretary of State saw the USA Today headline about Pence s private email. The passenger sent the photo to friends via Snapchat, and one of them saved it to share with the world:@jdawsey1 Hillary just checking the daily news. ""Pence used personal email in office."" The irony is palpable. pic.twitter.com/oia1ARiZ0g  Pere Noel (@RealSaintNick6) March 3, 2017The  what in the fuck?  look on Hillary s face is priceless. It s OK, we know what she s going through. We watched the Right froth at the mouth over what Ted Cruz would call a  nothingburger  if Clinton was a Republican for what seems like forever.It is not against the law to use a private email in Indiana, but officials are expected to retain the exchanges to fulfill public records requests. Documents released  via  a records request shows us that Pence discussed national security and other matters with his top advisors via his private email, but an unspecified number were withheld because   the state considers them confidential and too sensitive to release to the public. Once again, these are from an account that was hacked last summer. The Star notes that the scammer  sent an email to his contacts claiming Pence and his wife were stranded in the Philippines and in urgent need of money.  He responded not by increasing his security, but by creating a new AOL screen name.We will not be seeing calls to  LOCK HIM UP  from the Right, nor will we see GOP politicians calling for endless hearings and investigations. Normally, this would be fine but at this point there seems to be one set of rules for Democrats and one for Republicans in an administration that is easily outpacing even the accusations they leveled at Clinton.This photograph serves as a reminder of what Americans who knew better but decided that voting their  conscience  was more important than literally saving America from a despot and people who are too stupid to operate a fork without adult supervision yet figured out how to vote caused us to lose. We could have had a competent leader who isn t perfect, but she was at least smart enough to warn us about Donald Trump s cozy relationship with Vladimir Putin. And, of course, she isn t a walking human rights crisis.It s heartbreaking.Featured image via Twitter",News,4-Mar-17
 WATCH: Trump’s Top Cheerleader On CNN Just Got His A** Handed To Him,"Bill Maher literally called  bullshit  when a Donald Trump supporter insisted that Russia did not interfere with the 2016 Election.Racist CNN pundit Jeffrey Lord has made every excuse in the book to defend Trump and he brought the excuses to Real Time on Friday night when he attempted to spin the Russia scandal by claiming that Russia did nothing to help Trump to begin with.Maher was not in the mood for bullshit on this night as he called Lord out for supporting a  vulgar human being. Lord threw out a false equivalency by comparing everything Trump has said to Hillary Clinton s accurate assessment of Trump supporters as  deplorable  people.Apparently, Clinton s one comment magically makes every truly horrible thing Trump said disappear.Lord then tried to claim that Russia did not influence the election simply because they allegedly did not hack any voting machines.That s when Maher pounced. Don t bullsh*t me!  Maher responded before going over the fact that 17 intelligence agencies agree that Russia interfered in our election process by hacking the DNC and Clinton campaign officials. Russia also spread propaganda and misinformation to help Trump.Maher even mentioned that we could find out a whole lot more about Trump s deep ties to Russia if he were forced to release his taxes.Lord then parroted Trump by calling for an investigation into Nancy Pelosi for also meeting with the Russian ambassador, even though Pelosi s meeting was not a secret and Russia did not influence her election results. Russians didn t hack Nancy Pelosi s election,  Maher shot back.  They hacked our election, all of our intelligence agencies said for one side to win, your side. Are you telling me if it had worked out the other way and they were only hacking the Republicans to get Hilary elected you d let it slide? Lord tried to get away not answering for this hypocrisy. After all, Republicans would definitely be endlessly investigating Clinton if she had won the election with Russia s aid.But Maher forced Lord to answer and he conceded that Republicans are hypocrites.Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump s staunchest defenders should be ashamed of themselves. They should be ashamed as Americans and as human beings. They are literally defending a man who cares more about himself and his own image than he does about this country and our collective future. This Russia scandal is enough to get Trump impeached and he should be ousted before he can do more damage to this nation.Featured image via screenshot",News,4-Mar-17
 Trump Feels The Fury Of Twitter After Comparing Himself To Nixon While Attacking Obama (TWEETS),"After Donald Trump s Saturday morning tweetstorm, we have no choice but to wonder what, exactly, he is worried about. Ever since the  pee pee dossier  was originally released, we have seen Trump s ravings evolve from complaints about  FAKE NEWS  to demands that the  ILLEGAL LEAKS  stop. On Saturday, The Donald expanded on his at times incomprehensible ravings by blaming Obama for people learning about his and his campaign s illicit activities involving Russian oligarchs.Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ""wires tapped"" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017This isn t McCarthyism. While Trump did not provide any evidence of his claim, it was well known by intelligence agencies rather early in 2016. Trump even publicly asked the dictator of a hostile foreign power to hack his political opponents. It s only natural for our intelligence agencies to want to look into that.Saying nothing of the evidence that has been uncovered that his team kept in constant contact with high-ranking Russian officials during the campaign, Trump demanded to know if it is legal for our intelligence agencies to investigate someone who is openly colluding with Vladimir Putin against the interests of the American people:Is it legal for a sitting President to be ""wire tapping"" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Then, he threatened to go after President Obama in court because our intelligence agencies did their jobs:I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Trump didn t quite explain his next tweet, but he is more right than he knows about part of it.  How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  President Asterisk whined.This is, indeed, very much like Nixon/Watergate in that Nixon was guilty and did quite a bit of public flailing before the investigation into his crimes was complete. But it seems that Trump was saying that Nixon, like himself, was innocent and that President Obama was  sick  for allegedly authorizing wiretaps against such a pristine example of a human being as Trump.Naturally, Americans were all over this one:.@Mike_P_Williams this is truly staggering. He seems paranoid.

MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) March 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump Did he go so low as to collude with a foreign power to get himself elected?  Raoul Binderschmidt (@Skeletor_Jesus) March 4, 2017Ironically, last year it was revealed that Trump had a special console next to his bed at the Mar-A-Lago that allowed him to spy on guests  phone conversations. Though Trump denied it, numerous former staffers confirmed that the billionaire did, indeed, spy on guests. Unlike the possibility that our intelligence agencies did  tapp  Trump s phone during the campaign   with good reason   this would be a crime. It is illegal in Florida to intercept or record phone calls without the consent of everyone involved in the conversation.Hopefully, Trump is right that this is like Nixon/Watergate. We all know how that ended.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)/screengrab",News,4-Mar-17

Trump informed the American public that he   the President*   wants to  hear by  launch investigations into his political enemies because they have been in photographs taken during public, scheduled meetings with some of the same Russian folks with whom members of his administration have been busted having secret, off-the-books meetings.

 Sean Hannity Just Showed EXACTLY How Delusional Conservatives Are In A Single Statement,"What is with conservatives being all butthurt over criticism all of a sudden, now that Republicans are the target of so much ire? Suddenly they re all about respecting the President and his family, despite 8 long years of racist hate and conspiracy theories (without a shred of evidence supporting them) spewing forth from their mouthpieces.Consider Sean Hannity and what he just said. He literally said in comments on Media Matters For America: Nobody picked on Malia and Sasha, no conservative that I know of. Nobody picked on Michelle Obama except for the stupid statements,  for the first time in my adult life I m proud of my country.  She inserted herself into the campaign. If she s going to say something like that then she deserves to be criticized. What. WHAT? Just WHAT??? Hannity spent all of 2016 criticizing the hell out of Michelle Obama, including sharing a fake story about her from the lying website The Gateway Pundit. He offered to charter a plane for the Obamas to disappear to Canada, Kenya or Indonesia   anywhere as long as they didn t come back.But there s more, not just from Hannity s shit-spewing cakehole, but from conservatives damn near everywhere:And there s so much more. Hannity s a god-damn, motherfucking hypocrite for saying that conservatives were very kind to the Obamas. The above list is just the tip of the iceberg   conservatives were anything but kind to them during their term in the White House. What everyone s doing with Trump is nothing compared to that.Featured image by Rob Kim via Getty Images",News,4-Mar-17
 Jake Tapper BLASTS Trump’s ‘Do A Lot More With Less’ Line: Does A Weekly Visit To Palm Beach Qualify? (VIDEO),"Jake Tapper has just about had it with Donald Trump. The feisty host of CNN s The Lead infamously took Trump s top liar spin doctor, White House Counsel Kellyanne Conway, through a wood chipper for lying to him on air, and even banned her from his show briefly. He also rails Trump daily. Friday s subject? How much Trump is costing taxpayers with his weekly trips to his swanky Florida resort, Mar-A-Lago.Tapper first played the line in one of Trump s speech where he insisted that he and his staff would  do a lot more with less  for the American people. Tapper says after the clip: Do a lot more with less. Presidents are certainly entitled to take a day off, but any deficit hawk would ask: is a weekly visit to Palm Beach doing a lot more with less? It takes Marine One, Air Force One, and motorcades to get the president to his posh oceanside estate, along with intense Secret Service protection. There happens to be another presidential retreat, much closer and cheaper   that of course would be Camp David. It s already set up to be a working White House, and has security protocols in place. Some presidents used the Maryland site more than others, but Camp David is costing taxpayers millions to maintain, while it sits dormant. Then, Tapper hands it over to another CNN reporter, and informs us that Trump s weekly trips have already cost us more than $10 million in just the five weeks he s been in office.This is outrageous. Isn t there a way the Secret Service or someone can inform Trump that this isn t his money, or his private plane, that others are paying for this   most of them being people who absolutely despise him? Tapper is right to call Trump out, and it doesn t look like it will be stopping anytime soon.Watch the epic rant below:Featured image via Scott Eisen/Getty Images",News,3-Mar-17
 Internet Heroes Make Trump-Putin Facebook Friendship Anniversary Video; It’s BRILLIANT (VIDEO),"The internet is full of hidden gems, and this hostile political environment and corrupt Trump administration has given us some of the most hilarious, powerful memes and videos we ve seen in a while. The latest masterpiece to grace the internet was inspired by the friendship anniversary videos we ve been seeing on everyone s Facebook feed   the ones that celebrates close friendships with a highlight reel of all the time you ve spent connecting on Facebook.Well, two geniuses   filmmakers Evan and Adam Nix   have given us something truly amazing with a new friendship anniversary video   of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Poking fun at their disturbingly close and suspicious relationship, the Nix brothers got super creative and took a lighthearted approach to a concerning issue that most of America is extremely worried about. This video was released right as Trump is facing new criticism for his praise and defense of Russia, and his relationship with Putin and Russia has been called the biggest scandal in recent months.The Nix Bros. hilariously start the friendship anniversary out by stating  A few months ago today you rigged the election together The video goes through several pinnacle points of Trump and Putin s weird connection, even once striking a sentimental tone in their friendship: And while there are several dictatorships, there s only one like yours ;) That s terrifying! At the very end, the video closes with a statement almost every American   even conservatives   know to be true: We are all totally fucked. You can watch the film below: The short film is absolutely genius, and worth every second. The Nix Bros. are known for their funny political videos, and we re so happy they weighed in on Trump and Putin with their satirical brand of comedy.  At a time when the chaotic Trump administration is undoing everything America has worked to become, we all need a good laugh every now and then.Featured image is a screenshot",News,3-Mar-17
" Trump Just Got Some Really, REALLY Bad News About His Tax Returns (DETAILS)","Donald Trump has been playing games with his tax returns ever since he began his disgraceful presidential campaign. He repeatedly promised to release his tax returns after the election, but has continued to keep them a secret from the American people. Democrats and Republicans alike know that the American people deserve transparency from their president, and the latest effort to make Trump reveal his tax documents is going to send him into a rage.Two House Republicans have just joined a Democratic effort to obtain copies of Trump s tax returns, with the help of the Internal Revenue Service. This is big news   and proves that not even the GOP approves of the way Trump has conducted himself.The two Republicans, Reps. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) and Walter Jones (R-N.C.), have added their signatures to a letter requesting Trump s tax returns from the past ten years. This letter was championed by Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.)  and backed by almost every person in the 193-member House Democratic Caucus. In the letter, it is stated that Trump s tax returns would provide clarity on his conflicts of interest, which Trump has tried to hide and distract from. The letter says: Disclosure would serve the public interest of clarifying President Trump s conflicts of interest in office, the potential for him to personally benefit from tax reform, and ensure that he is not receiving any preferential treatment from the IRS.We believe the powerful and respected Committees on Finance and Ways and Means have the responsibility to ensure oversight of the executive branch by requesting a review of President Trump s tax returns and moving toward a formal release of these documents to the public. Trump s refusal to reveal his tax returns is unusual, breaking four decades in which every presidential nominee has been transparent with their tax returns. Trump tried to use an IRS audit to excuse himself, but even the IRS stated he was free to release his documents whenever he wanted to. Hopefully, this letter and the Republican senators  signatures will add enough pressure to the situation so Americans can finally know the truth about Trump.Featured image via Drew Angerer / Getty Images",News,3-Mar-17
 Rachel Maddow Reveals Her Secret To Successfully Covering Trump,"The Rachel Maddow Show has become a hit among cable news viewers, with more than double the number of people tuning in. Maddow herself recently revealed her secret to successfully covering Donald Trump: treat him like a silent movie. We developed sort of an informal, internal mantra  which is that we basically cover them as if they are a silent movie,  Maddow explained. I stopped covering the Twitter feed and we started covering only what they do rather than what they say. Without a doubt, she s doing something right. The Wrap reports that in February, Maddow had the  largest total viewer audience ever in the 9 p.m. ET timeslot.  But her success isn t limited to just one month. She has also  beaten CNN s regularly scheduled programming for 45 straight months,  and  gained 99 percent in total viewers compared to February 2016.  During the same time period, CNN gained only 70 percent and Fox News increased by a measly 31 percent. It is an unusual thing that the White House and its chief spokespeople have been called out saying stuff that s not true over and over and over again,  she said.  It s the petty stuff but it s also important stuff that they ve not told the truth about. Maddow explains that lies have consequences. Once you prove yourself as untrustworthy, you words no longer have any real meaning.  We no longer go to that person for factual information,  Maddow said. Once she realized that these people could no longer be trusted, she came up with a new game plan for covering the Trump administration. I really feel like it was helpful to me, in terms of trying to come up with what to talk about every day, and serving up information for our audience that is substantive and not manipulated by people at the White House,  Maddow said.  It was helpful for us to just stop paying attention to what they were saying. Maddow said that Kellyanne Conway might be a nice person,  but as her fellow MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski recently pointed out, she s just not credible anymore.  Maddow added that conversations with her (and most of Trump s other surrogates) are  essentially just talking to a pro-Trump political operative  rather than actually speaking to a White House representative.It seems that Maddow has done what the majority of the media is still struggling to do. She has figured out how to cover Trump and the secret is simple: focus only on what they do, not what they say because it s probably a lie anyway.Featured image via video screen capture",News,3-Mar-17
 Trump Camp Adviser Drops STUNNING Revelation – Here’s Why The RNC Suddenly Went Pro-Russia,"The evidence that Russia is buying us up continues to mount, and the pile is so tall it s about to tip over. While Trump is busy accusing Chuck Schumer of being a hypocrite because he s met with Russia too (a thing he openly admits and has never lied about or covered up, which is the issue with Trump s people), one of his campaign advisers, J.D. Gordon, has decided to reverse course on his statements about why the RNC reversed its course on Russia and inserted pro-Russian language to its platform.Now he s saying this: [I, along with others] advocated for the GOP platform to include language against arming Ukrainians against pro-Russian rebels because this was in line with Trump s views, expressed at a March national security meeting at the unfinished Trump hotel [in Washington, D.C.]  [emphasis mine]Apparently, Trump didn t want to start WWIII over Ukraine (but he s perfectly willing to start it on Twitter with China, Mexico, and all of NATO).Gordon says that Trump believed helping get Russia out of Ukraine was anathema to  improved relations with Russia.  The problem with  improved relations with Russia  is that Trump doesn t want that for world peace and unity. He wants it because he s in bed with Putin, along with Jared Kushner, Jeff Sessions, and disgraced security adviser Michael Flynn.Sessions actually presided over the meeting where that plank of the platform was changed. Look impossibly suspicious yet? It should. To make Trump s growing ties to Russia even more crystal clear here, the week that this went down was also the week that Wikileaks released thousands of emails that Russia had obtained via its hacks.Seriously, can we impeach Trump now? The time for that started the day he was inaugurated. We have an entire administration selling us out to one of our biggest enemies, and an entire political party that won t do a thing about it, likely because it will make them look as corrupt as they are.Featured image by John Moore via Getty Images",News,3-Mar-17

That s bad news for a guy like Trump who often takes to Twitter in anger-fueled rants and doesn t take the time to proofread his tweets, or even let spellcheck do it for him.In Trump s latest grouping of tweets, he really, really messed up. In fact, following a tweet that said,  We must fix our education system,  he tweeted  I hear by demand  and then,   I hearby demand    and then finally,  I hereby demand.

Take the following tweet by the origin of  fake news,  Fox: Democratic lawmakers who met with Russian Ambassador. pic.twitter.com/NEmwYLa790  Fox News (@FoxNews) March 3, 2017That s right   conservatives are trying to say that since Democrats have talked to Russians before, there s no wrongdoing here.Except that awkward part where none of the pictured Democrats lied under oath about it.Except that SUPER awkward part where Democrats weren t part of a presidential campaign that benefited from, if not colluded with, Russian hacking and attempts to derail our 2016 electoral process.Users on Twitter are calling Fox  News  out for this incredibly misleading bullsh*t: @FoxNews Which ones then lied about the meeting under oath?

 Trump Demands Investigation Into His Political Enemies And Gets Torn Apart By Twitter (TWEETS),"Brace yourself, people. Senator Charles Schumer once had a donut and coffee with Vladimir Putin during an official 2003 state visit to a Russian gas station chain that opened in New York. Sure, Schumer wasn t running for President and this was a public meeting. He also did not perjure himself like Attorney General Jeff Sessions   but according to Donald Trump, the lies he and his administration have told the American people and the crimes they have committed right in front of us mean nothing because Schumer was once photographed doing his job when Vladimir Putin happened to be a part of it.Oh, yes, and he should be investigated, for asking questions about Trump and friends  clearly treasonous actions.

 Trump Tries To Tie Chuck Schumer To Putin With Insane Twitter Fit (IMAGE),"It is becoming clearer and clearer that Donald Trump and the people around him have serious ties to Vladimir Putin and Russian operatives. On top of that, the story regarding Trump s Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, meeting with the Russian Ambassador and lying about it under oath completely stepped on what could have been a good news cycle after a surprisingly semi-normal speech delivered to a joint session of Congress. So, what does Trump do in retaliation? Why, he takes to Twitter, of course.First, Trump insisted that it was  illegal leaks  and  fake news  that was the REAL story, not Sessions s shading dealings with the Russian Ambassador and his lies regarding said dealings. When that tactic didn t kill the story, Trump tried an even more insane approach, and tweeted a 13-year-old photo of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) with Vladimir Putin.This approach makes no sense at all, considering that Team Trump keeps saying that there s absolutely nothing wrong with people in Congress meeting with foreign diplomats and leaders, be they adversaries or otherwise. However, Trump plowed on, and tweeted the following:So, let me get this straight. Trump s people   and let s face, it likely Trump himself   wants a decade- plus old photo of Chuck Schumer with Vladimir Putin investigated, but wants the investigation into his people s dealings with Russian operatives during a presidential campaign that everyone knows was compromised by Russia dropped? That s rich.Don t fall for it, folks. This is nothing but a ridiculous distraction. Where there s smoke, there s fire. There s no smoke with Schumer   but there sure as hell is plenty of smoke with Trump and Co. Let s keep our eye on the ball here, and root these treasonous squatters out of our White House.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,3-Mar-17
 Five Facts About The Obama Economy That Trump Does NOT Want You To Know,"Trump likes to pretend he was handed  a mess  when he took office. Unfortunately, that s just not true. By the numbers, consumer confidence is the highest in a decade, unemployment is under five percent, and the country has been adding jobs for 80 straight months.Let s compare that to what President Obama inherited   the November before he took office, 533,000 jobs were lost, and up to three quarters of a million jobs were being lost per month during the crisis. That s over half a million jobs lost in a single month. The United States was in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Obviously voters have short memories, or they d never have given control over the economy back to Republicans after the last fiasco. Hell, even Trump says the economy does better under Democrats.From Bloomberg:Obama took office during the worst recession since the Great Depression, when the economy was losing 750,000 jobs a month and already had lost a record 9 percent of GDP. He completed his two terms with the largest annual gain in the value of the dollar, the biggest annual decrease in household debt as a percentage of disposable income, and the largest annual increases in car sales and hourly wages. His presidency coincided with the second-highest annual gain in home equity and trailed only the Clinton period in deficit reduction as a percentage of GDP.Facts matter.For all their talk of  balanced budgets,  Republicans are really, really bad at balancing budgets. That s probably because they re more concerned with tax breaks for the rich and big business than they are with actually staying grounded in reality.It s well-known that President Clinton is the only modern president to ever balance the budget, and President Obama did the best after him as a percentage of GDP   and that s including the massive stimulus he used to fix our broken economy. The last Republican president, President George W. Bush, increased the nation s debt over 100 percent and left us with the financial crisis.In Trump s world of alternative facts, half the country is unemployed and begging for a savior. That doesn t match up with reality, though. The latest jobs report from the Department of Labor shows the truth   a 4.6 percent unemployment rate, and nearly sixteen million jobs added over the last eight years. I ll remind you again   the economy was losing hundreds of thousands of jobs per month when President Obama assumed office. He saved us.The United States is poised to save $100 billion in healthcare spending over the next decade thanks to Obamacare, studies have shown. Meanwhile, Republicans want to repeal Obamacare for strictly political purposes (likely replacing it with a similar plan   it was a conservative plan to start with, as most progressives favor Medicare-for-all or another form of universal healthcare), which is estimated to cost hundreds of billions  not to mention leaving the American people high and dry when it comes to seeking medical care.You can also thank President Obama for the fact that the United States is still competitive in the automotive industry. His stimulus single-handedly saved American cars. In fact, hundreds of thousands of jobs were added thanks to him, and GM, Ford, and Chrysler all saw significant profit increases thanks to the Obama task force. The Bush administration gets a tiny bit of credit for short-term loans that prevented bankruptcy until Obama assumed office, but that s giving credit holding off slightly on a disaster Bush was initially responsible for. Then President Obama stepped in and fixed it.Featured image via Pool/Getty",News,3-Mar-17
 WATCH: Nicolle Wallace Just Ripped Trump A New One For Having So Much Secret Contact With Russia,"If Donald Trump and his team were planning to continue using the ole  I forgot  defense to explain all these secret meetings with Russian officials during the campaign, he should think again.Because during an appearance on the TODAY Show with Chuck Todd, Republican strategist Nicolle Wallace blew that defense out of the water by pointing out that while one Trump official could reasonably say they forgot about a meeting, it s really hard to believe that all of them could have simply forgotten that they met with Russian officials.The number of Trump officials who met or spoke to Russian officials during the campaign has only risen in recent weeks as it has been revealed that Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner both communicated with them during the election in addition to Michael Flynn, who lied about his own contact with Russian officials and had to resign for it. It s inexplicable now why so many people had so many meetings with so many Russians that they forgot about,  Wallace said.Wallace went on to call for a 9/11-style commission to investigate Trump s Russia scandal and when Todd asked if Trump and his team could offer one big excuse to explain their actions, she made it clear that Trump is cornered. There is none! So many people having so many contacts and not remembering? It doesn t make sense. They re either the most forgetful team in political history or the most intimate with Russia. And neither one of those labels is good for Trump and his administration.Here s the video:Jeff Sessions did not forget his meeting with Russian officials during the campaign. He simply lied under oath about it and is making an excuse to avoid being charged with committing perjury.Donald Trump s Russia scandal only continues to get worse and his desperate attempts to distract the American public no longer work. It s time for Congress to take this scandal seriously and investigate it. But Republicans should not investigate it themselves. It s clear they are too biased to do it, so they must appoint an independent commission and a special prosecutor. It s the only way to make sure this gets done and gets done right.Featured image via YouTube",News,3-Mar-17
 Hypocrite Jeff Sessions’ OWN WORDS On Perjury Just Came Back To Bite Him On The Ass,"If Jeff Sessions really cares about the law and the Constitution he ll read his own words about perjury and resign in disgrace.During his confirmation hearing to become Donald Trump s Attorney General, Sessions took a very clear question from Senator Al Franken and answered it with a very clear answer.Sessions was asked if he had any communication with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians,  Sessions responded.And as we now know, that was a complete and total lie that was told under oath.In other words, Sessions perjured himself in front of Congress.So far, Sessions has refused to resign, and that makes him a hypocrite considering what he once said about Bill Clinton in 1999 after Republicans failed to impeach the former president.According to the New York Times, here is what Sessions had to say after the acquittal.It has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty that President William Jefferson Clinton perjured himself before a Federal grand jury and has persisted in a continuous pattern of lying and obstructing justice. The chief law-enforcement officer of the land, whose oath of office calls on him to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, crossed the line and failed to defend and protect the law and, in fact, attacked the law and the rights of a fellow citizen. Under our Constitution, equal justice requires that he forfeit his office. For these reasons, I felt compelled to vote to convict and remove the President from office. . . .It is crucial to our system of justice that we demand the truth. I fear that an acquittal of this President will weaken the legal system by providing an option for those who consider being less than truthful in court. Whereas the handling of the case against President Nixon clearly strengthened the nation s respect for law, justice and truth, the Clinton impeachment may unfortunately have the opposite result.Now the man who called for  equal justice  and said  we demand the truth  just got caught committing perjury and he is refusing to forfeit his office.Having an extramarital affair is not against the law. But Republicans decided to go on a political witch hunt for it back in the 1990s even though several of those lawmakers who voted to impeach Clinton were themselves caught cheating on their spouses.Colluding with the Russians during a critical election on behalf of the Republican candidate and lying about it under oath is far worse than anything Bill Clinton ever did.By all rights, Sessions should be impeached from office, but Republicans are only interested in impeaching officials if it helps their agenda. They are hypocrites and the whole lot of them do not deserve to hold office in this country.It s time for Jeff Sessions to look at himself in the mirror and decide if equal justice and the truth are as important to him now as he claimed it was then. Because if not, he should not be the Attorney General.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,3-Mar-17
 WATCH: Patrick Stewart Is Doing Something AWESOME So He Can Fight Back Against Donald Trump,"Sir Patrick Stewart, like any sane person in or outside of the U.S., has a severe problem with Donald Trump and everything he stands for. He s so determined to oppose Trump in everything he does that he s doing something absolutely incredible: He s applied for U.S. citizenship. Speaking on  The View,  he said his friends were telling him how he can help: All of my friends in Washington said,  There is one thing you can do. Fight, fight, oppose, oppose. But how do you do that when you re a resident and citizen of a foreign country? Yes, Stewart is British and the U.K. is one of our biggest, best and closest allies, but he s still a foreign national. It seems he feels that, as a foreigner, his ability to help us out is limited. Joy Behar jokingly asked him if he d be willing to take Trump off our hands, and his initial reply was,  We have our own problems.  That was in reference to Brexit, which was the dumbest thing a Western nation had done in recent history right up until we told the U.K. to hold our beer while we held an election. But then he dropped this: I m not a [U.S.] citizen. However, there is, maybe it s the only good thing, as the result of this election: I am now applying for citizenship. Because I want to be an American too. Is there a more meaningful way to help us resist the growing corrupt, authoritarian regime occupying the White House?

" Former Secretary Of State Drops MASSIVE Shocker On Trump’s Foreign Policy, And He’ll DESPISE It","Madeleine Albright, who served as Secretary of State under Bill Clinton, has something to say about Trump and his immigration and foreign policy positions. Trump, as we all know, is in love with the idea that only he and his policies can protect us from ISIS. However, real international diplomats know that s not true, and Albright said so on a podcast with former Obama strategist David Axelrod.Albright just came right out and said it: If this   anti-immigrant rhetoric and the executive order that came out was supposed to protect us, it has done the opposite. Frankly, it s a great recruiting tool for ISIS. We already know that ISIS has used Trump in recruiting videos, but what Albright says is that Trump is destroying any incentive that Iraqis and other Middle Easterners might have to help us, as opposed to helping ISIS or doing nothing at all. Trump s Muslim ban doesn t just alienate them, it also makes it a lot more difficult to gather intelligence from the region. We need cooperation for intelligence-gathering, but why should they help us when we re openly calling them the enemy via our immigration policies?Albright also said that she believes Trump and his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, are actually hostile to Europe while being overly friendly to Russia. That, too, can serve as recruitment for ISIS and other terrorist groups, if for no other reason than it demonstrates how fickle we are, and how unlikely to keep our promises and back up our allies we are.Trump claimed he could beat ISIS inside of 30 days (although he didn t say which 30-day period he was talking about). If nothing else, he s said that we have to beef up our military strength, and implied that we need to ally with whoever we can (even former enemies) in order to beat them.Albright is right, and Trump is putting us in danger. All his anti-immigrant, nationalist rhetoric does is galvanize everyone who already felt alienated by our foreign policy. That includes Muslims, particularly those living here in the U.S. We are not safer under Trump, and ISIS knows that.Featured image by Aude Guerrucci via Getty Images",News,2-Mar-17
 Trump Just Accidentally Confirmed Russian Contact With Sessions In Latest Twitter Fit,"Just when you thought Trump might have calmed down while basking in the glow of his written-for-him speech at the Joint Address, he decides to come out and make zero sense with a chopped up statement about Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He could have just left it as a statement on his Facebook page and offered a link to it, but no, he decided to appear as crazy as ever.Keep in mind it was about eight minutes between tweets   that s a lot of words for his tiny thumbs.He tweeted: Jeff Sessions is an honest man. He did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional. This whole narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed to win. The Democrats are overplaying their hand.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017First of all, Sessions didn t only lie, he lied under oath, which is otherwise known as perjury. Trump then saying he he could have been more accurate also proves he lied.Secondly, this has nothing to do with Democrats and everything to do with listening to our entire intelligence community and following through with evidence that Russia interfered with our election. Something Trump doesn t want to look into, because a.) he either took part in it OR b.) because he won and doesn t want the results changed. Both reasons prove he cares nothing about the sanctity of American democracy.Lastly, saying there are leaks and that there s nothing there in the same sentence contradicts itself. Which is it? Are there leaks with info getting out about Russia? Or is there nothing there? Can t be both.Trump is running in circles and is clearly panicked. He s trying to say there s nothing wrong with any of this and it s all everyone else s fault (never his), meanwhile, he s making himself look pretty damn guilty.Having Twitter fits late in the evening isn t a good look on anyone.Featured Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,2-Mar-17
 Trump Advisor’s Excuse For His Boss Ignoring White Terrorism Is Beyond Laughable; It’s Dangerous,"Donald Trump took quite a bit of heat following the racist shooting in Kansas City that resulted in the deaths of two Indian engineers. The perpetrator shouted what sounded like Trump-inspired racial slurs like  get out of my country,  before killing Srinivas Kuchibholta, who died and Alok Madasani, who was injured. Trump took almost a week to address the shooting at all. There was also a spate of vandalism toward Jewish cemeteries and for most of a week, crickets from Trump.Trump did finally talk about the shooting and the vandalism in his address to Congress on Tuesday, but many say it was too little too late. After all, Trump doesn t hesitate in calling out Muslim terrorists. He and his people even make up terrorist attacks.In an interview with CNN s Alisyn Camerota, Trump surrogate Anthony Scaramucci said that the only reason Trump didn t address the Kansas City shooting and the string of vandalism in Jewish cemeteries, was that it would cause more fear and civil unrest. He s not constantly condemning [hate crimes by white people],  Camerota pointed out.  There was silence after Kansas City. He didn t tweet about it. Some people felt if had it been a Muslim, had it been a Middle Eastern gunman instead of a white gunman, he would have immediately condemned it. The president is controlling the bully pulpit and the news cycle, and he doesn t want to overly discuss the stuff because you re worried that in itself will cause a fire,  he replied.  You re trying to strike the right balance. You can agree with me or disagree with me. I do believe the president has consistently, and maybe not with the level of volume you d like, but he has consistently and his administration has consistently denounced these acts of violence. Source: Raw StoryHere s the video:Let s see if you can follow that logic   and I ll be frank, I m having trouble with it. Trump s anti-Muslim rhetoric, which has always flowed freely whenever he speaks or tweets, is a huge recruiting tool for ISIS. Apparently, he doesn t care that he is causing unrest and fear toward Muslims and by Muslims.Hate crimes since the election have been up and hate groups are on the rise. The horse has left the barn as far as Trump inspiring hate, but he does have the bully pulpit. If he can influence hate, he can certainly influence people not to act on their hatred. He won t, though. As more and more sane people turn against him, Trump is left with a base that looks a lot like Hitler s Brownshirts. He doesn t want to offend his biggest supporters.Featured image via video screen capture",News,2-Mar-17
 Rachel Maddow Obtains Document That Means VERY BAD News For Trump’s Muslim Ban,"Ever since the courts blocked Donald Trump s ridiculous Muslim ban, the White House has been saying that they will fight it all the way, that the ban would be back in short order. However, the Trump Administration keeps putting it off. Now, it seems that the ban may not happen at all.The Rachel Maddow Show has obtained a document from the Department of Homeland Security that essentially says that the travel ban based upon nationality has absolutely nothing to do with protecting the nation from terrorist attacks. In fact, the new document says that most extremists are brainwashed into their ideology right here on American soil. They generally tend to be citizens and legal residents. So, in other words, there is absolutely no reason to ban people based upon nationality. Couple that with the fact that Trump and those in his orbit are openly anti-Muslim, and one can only conclude that this  travel ban  is nothing but an attempt to make Trump s call to keep Muslims out of the country pass constitutional muster.Even more damning is the fact that the chaos caused by the clumsy roll out of Trump s original Executive Order regarding this matter, and we can only come to the conclusion that Trump will again be met with resistance from the courts if he tries to do this again.Watch the report below:Featured image via Erik McGregor/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images",News,2-Mar-17
" Trump EXPLODES After Jeff Sessions Gets Caught Lying About Russia, Claims It’s A ‘Total Witch Hunt’","Jeff Sessions just got busted for lying about his ties to Russia during the campaign and Donald Trump was quick to whine about it.When Sessions was being grilled in the Senate during his confirmation hearing, Senator Al Franken asked him directly if he had been in contact with the Russians during the election. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians,  Sessions said.Sessions  statement was made under oath, which means he committed perjury. Perjury is illegal and that means the United States currently has an Attorney General who broke the law to gain his position.Several lawmakers have demanded that Sessions resign and recuse himself from any investigations into Donald trump s ties to Russia.So far, Sessions has refused to resign, which is rather hypocritical since Michael Flynn lied to Mike Pence and had to resign. And Flynn was not under oath when he lied. Sessions WAS under oath.Despite getting caught lying, Trump issued an official White House hissy fit calling the whole scandal a  witch hunt  against  an honest man  while also once again bringing up the election results and the leaks.

 President Obama To Receive Distinguished ‘Profiles In Courage’ Award,"On the 100th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy s birth, President Barack Obama will be awarded the prestigious Proles in Courage award, which honors those who show grace and courage in American politics.Written in an email sent out by Kennedy s grandson, Jack Schlossberg:On behalf of the Profile in Courage Award Committee, I m honored to tell you that this year, as we celebrate the centennial of President Kennedy s birth, we have chosen a man who has elevated the standard of political courage in a new century: President Barack H. Obama.Faced with unrelenting political opposition, President Obama has embodied the definition of courage that my grandfather cites in the opening lines of Profiles in Courage:  Grace under pressure.  Throughout his two terms in office, he represented all Americans with decency, integrity, and an unshakable commitment to the greater good.There is no other person more deserving of this award than President Obama, whose family oriented and good-natured demeanor is sharply missed.The email went on to say that  President Obama put policy above politics  through his work with healthcare reform, normalizing Cuban-American relations, and his fight against climate change.The awards have been given out every year since 1989, and past recipients include Russ Feingold, Gerald Ford, George W. Bush, John Lewis, Gabrielle Giffiords, Ted Kennedy and the brave men and women who sacrificed their lives and safety on 9/11.Simply put, this award is given to those who put personal feelings, politics and their safety aside to do what is right in our national discoursePresident Obama will receive his award on May 7 and give a speech. According to the committee chairman that doles out the award, Al Hunt, President Obama was not given it because of any one specific action taken while in office (as most people are given). Instead the committee wanted to  do something different this year,  and that the committee was in  total agreement  about President Obama getting the award.Congratulations, Mr. President. After right years of unparalleled obstruction and racism, I can think of no one more deserving. He held his head high with grace and dignity, and never besmirched or questioned the character of those he disagreed with.

 Analysis: Trump Lied 53 Times During His Congressional Speech,"Recently, the mainstream media (yes, including the  liberals ) fawned over President Trump s  presidential  address to a joint session of Congress. Why? Because he actually acted like a semi-decent human being. Instead of going off script on his usual childish tantrums and praise of himself, he stuck to the teleprompter and delivered a pretty forgettable speech.There was just one tiny thing that the mainstream media failed to notice: his speech was absolutely riddled with lies. And when we say riddled, we mean a significant chunk of the things he said in his hour speech were either misleading, factually incorrect, or flat out falsehoods.The Center for American Progress found that in the 61 minutes President Trump spoke, he lied 53 times. That s one lie almost every minute.Through an incredibly detailed spread sheet, CAP was able to identify every false statement and correct it for the record. It s pretty damning to see how often and easily the President of the United States can lie to the American people.Among President Trump s most egregious lies were:Everyone knows Trump lies and lies often. We ve known this since the campaign. We know that everything listed above can be easily disproved. The only reason Trump got high marks for his speech was 1) less people watched than the previous one, 2) more Republicans watched than independents and Democrats, and 3) he spoke  normally.  Besides that, it was typical Trump: an ill-informed demagogue who stokes fear by racially scapegoating Mexicans and blaming everything on President Obama.The media (and indeed the American electorate) cannot let President Trump get away with being a shameful liar simply because he talks in a polite voice and stays on script. America is better than to forgive this fascist after all he s done to this country and our standing in the world. Be vigilant.Featured image Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,2-Mar-17
 Tom Hanks Gives White House Press Corps A Great Gift To Help Them Keep Fighting Trump,"Actor and Medal of Freedom recipient Tom Hanks is doing his part to support the free press against the tyranny of Donald Trump.The White House Press Corps has had to deal with a lot of bullshit, so Hanks sent them a gift that ought to keep them going for the long haul.CNN White House producer Allie Malloy reported on Twitter that Hanks sent the White House Press Corps an expresso machine so they can keep pumping themselves full of all the caffeine and sugar they need for all the long days and late nights of keeping the American public informed on what Trump and his administration are doing. Keep up the good fight for Truth, Justice, and the American Way,  Hanks wrote before taking a clear shot at Trump.  Especially for the Truth part. Tom Hanks note to the WH press corps attached to the espresso machine he gifted. pic.twitter.com/JAZy8ghetc  Allie Malloy (@AlliemalCNN) March 2, 2017Indeed, Trump lies every time he opens his mouth and his team refers to their lies as  alternative facts. The press has had to dig deep since Trump took office to keep the American people informed and fact-check all of his claims, most of which have been debunked as lies.This isn t the first time Hanks has slammed Trump.During the campaign Hanks burned Trump for bragging about grabbing women by the genitals without their consent. He was at work, man,  Hanks said during an interview in October.  He wasn t in a locker room. He was at work. He was showing up to do a thing on camera. Look  I m offended as a man. I m not offended as a husband or a father. I m offended as a guy. That s just not right, I m sorry. It s not right at work, it s not right in the locker room. It s wrong, period. The end. That s all.

 Betsy DeVos: Black Colleges That Came From Jim Crow Are Models Of ‘School Choice’,"Donald Trump s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, doesn t just have trouble with grammar. Apparently, she struggles with American history as well.Following Trump s meeting with the leaders of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), DeVos sent out a tweet that can only be described as completely clueless. According to the new education secretary, HBCUs are pioneers of  school choice. Wowwowwow. These paragraphs are from a real, official US Department of Education statement from Betsy DeVos released today. pic.twitter.com/I2FDZfzdmt  Ankit Panda (@nktpnd) February 28, 2017DeVos couldn t have gotten things more backward if she had tried. Historically black schools aren t models of  school choice.  In fact, it is the exact opposite. These schools arose because there was no choice. Slaves were forbidden from learning how to read and write. Following their emancipation, most white schools refused to let black students in.The first HBCUs were started to educate black teachers so that black children would have a shot at receiving any type of education at all. Later, in addition to the private institutions that had been founded, southern states set up public colleges to serve blacks rather than integrate existing schools.If DeVos really believes this is something to aspire to, it certainly does explain a lot. As secretary of education, she plans to  fix  our  broken  education system by diverting federal funds from public schools to private schools, which are largely unregulated. Critics argue that this will serve only to accelerate the resegregation of American schools.Following the integration of public schools in America, white parents who didn t want their children to share classrooms with black students opted to send their children to private schools. In the decade following the passage of the Civil Rights Act, approximately half a million white students left public schools for private ones.Maybe DeVos isn t just an idiot with no understanding of history after all. Between her tweet and her vision for the future of American schools, we are forced to ask if taking our children and their education back to the days of Jim Crow has really been her intention all along.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,2-Mar-17
 GOP Rep Goes Full Racist While Giving RIDICULOUS Reasons For Avoiding Town Hall,"A cowardly Republican gave a racist excuse for why he doesn t want to face his constituents at a town hall.As angry Americans show up to town halls to give their Republican representatives hell over their obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act, an Illinois Republican has decided that he doesn t care about his constituents enough to take criticism from them in person.Rep. Mike Bost has been largely ducking his constituents by holding tele-town halls that they aren t informed about until the last minute, which means not a lot of people are able to participate. Those that do are dedicated supporters who will agree with everything Bost says without any push back whatsoever. The in-person ones going on around the United States right now are out of control, which means you don t actually get to talk to people and listen, and we re looking for ways to do that,  Bost told The Southern Illinoisan.And then Bost made a racist comparison to describe the angry people who are attending town halls. The amount of time that I have at home is minimal, I need to make sure that it s productive. You know the cleansing that the Orientals used to do where you d put one person out in front and 900 people yell at them? That s not what we need. We need to have meetings with people that are productive. I m not going to have the public town hall meetings, in that respect, because I am busy trying to work on the issue,  Bost continued.  If all you want to do is stand and yell at me   we re not going back and forth. What Bost wants is a town hall where he won t be criticized and won t have to answer the criticism. You know, because Bost and Republicans like him are snowflakes who want to pretend that everyone likes them and what they are doing in Congress.Republicans know that repealing the Affordable Care Act is getting more and more unpopular as their own constituents begin to realize that they will lose their own healthcare.To explain the anger at town halls, Republicans have falsely portrayed their own constituents as out-of-state paid protesters rather than admit that they are wrong to repeal the landmark healthcare program.But as Republicans continue to duck their voters they will only make them angrier in the long run. When the 2018 midterm election comes around they won t be able to avoid the voice of the people then. And they will discover quickly that they made a huge mistake by not facing their constituents when they had a chance.Featured image via St. Louis Public Radio",News,2-Mar-17
 ‘The Fuse Is Lit’: Legendary News Anchor Dan Rather Says Trump-Russia Scandal Is About To EXPLODE,"Legendary news anchor Dan Rather said on Thursday that it shouldn t be long now before Donald Trump s cozy relationship with Russia becomes a real problem for him. Every once in a while in Washington, the fuse is lit for what seems to be a big scandal. Much more rarely does that fuse lead to an explosion of the magnitude we are seeing with Russia and the new Administration, and frankly the Republicans in Congress,  Rather wrote on Facebook.  How can anybody say, with all this billowing smoke and sights of actual flames, that there is no need to at least independently investigate whether a fire is burning down the very pillars of our democracy? The numerous investigations currently ongoing into the Trump campaign s  constant  contact with high-level Russian officials, Michael Flynn s resignation after it was revealed that he lied  bigly  about his relationship with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak   and, of course now the likelihood that notorious racist Jeff Sessions also perjured himself about his coziness with Kislyak, Rather says things are going to get bad quickly:The pressure is obviously starting to mount as leading Republicans are now calling for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. This comes in the wake of serious and credible evidence reported by a vigilant press that the Attorney General, mind you the top law enforcement man in the United States, perjured himself in testimony to the Senate about meeting the Russian ambassador during the election. Sessions is but the latest person close to President Trump who seems to be ensnared in a story that is more worthy of Hollywood melodrama than the reality of the governance of our country. Democrats are calling for Sessions to resign, and this story could move very quickly. We are well past the time for any political niceties or benefits of the doubt. We need an independent and thorough investigation of Russia s meddling in our democracy and its ties to the President and his allies,  Rather says.  We don t know what we don t know. Perhaps there are perfectly innocuous reasons for why Mr Trump won t release his tax returns, why he has continued to speak admirably about President Putin and why his aides and advisors seem to be so close to Russia. That s why we need an investigation. If the air is to be cleared, it needs to be cleared. And if there is deep rot, it needs to be exposed. And quickly. Rather says that the press is doing an  admirable  job at holding this administration to account, but  there is only so much it can do without such things as subpoena powers :Let s just make this clear. This is about a foreign and hostile power trying to influence our election while being in contact with close aides to the presidential campaign that the Kremlin wanted to win. Furthermore, there are serious questions about Mr Trump s longstanding ties to Russian money and influence peddlers. We don t know where this might go, but it isn t going away.Rather is right   things are looking pretty bad for Trump.

 BREAKING: Republican House Intel Chair THREATENS The Press After Asking About Russia (VIDEO),"There is something going on right now within our government that is very, very concerning. With evidence stacking up against Donald Trump and his administration regarding connections to Russia, the Republican party seems to be defending him. Part of that defense seems to be a direct threat agains the press for having the audacity to use their First Amendment right to hold the *president accountable and tell the whole story.During a press conference with House Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA), instead of answering questions about Russia, he turned the questions on their head and told the press that if they are found trying to seek answers from the Russian embassy that they will be the ones investigated.In an effort to deflect, Nunes said: I m sure some of you are in contact with the Russian embassy, so be careful what you ask for here, because if we start getting transcripts of any of you or other Americans talking to the press   do you want us to conduct an investigation on you or other Americans because you were talking to the Russian embassy. I just think we need to be careful. What the hell is happening? The press will be investigated for trying to report the story? How about investigate Donald Trump and his administration. How about hold him accountable for his many actions. How about demanding to see his tax returns so we can see his financial ties for the safety and security of the nation. How about instead of threatening reporters, you put party politics aside and work for the American people as you were elected to do.Wow.

 Trump Jr Was Paid $50k For An Event Hosted By Russian Allies In October (DETAILS),"It s not just people tied to alleged president Donald Trump s campaign and administration who are linked to Russia, it s also his eldest son. According to the Wall Street Journal, Donald Trump Jr. was likely paid at least $50,000 for an appearance late last year before a French think tank whose founder and wife are allies of the Russian government in efforts to end the war in Syria.On Oct. 11 at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, hosted by the Center of Political and Foreign Affairs, Trump s son addressed a dinner.We re not sure how a murderous thug like Vladimir Putin would be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize:Its president, Fabien Baussart, and his Syrian-born wife, Randa Kassis, have cooperated with Russia in its drive to end the Syrian civil war, according to U.S., European and Arab officials. In December, Mr. Baussart formally nominated Russian President Vladimir Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.Mrs. Kassis is a leader of a political faction endorsed by Russia in negotiations to end the war in Syria. The couple said they don t represent Russia and are solely focused on ending the Syrian conflict. Donald Trump Jr. has been participating in business-related speaking engagements for over a decade discussing a range of topics including sharing his entrepreneurial experiences and offering career specific advice,  the company s vice-president for marketing said.But it appears to be about more than sharing experiences.Mrs. Kassis heads a political party, the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, which is part of a faction endorsed by Russia in international negotiations aimed at ending the six-year Syrian conflict. She regularly visits Moscow to coordinate policy with Russia s Foreign Ministry, said Arab and European officials, and portrayed in Russian state media.In interviews, Mrs. Kassis said she stressed to Donald Trump Jr. in October the need for the U.S. and Russia to cooperate in ending the Syrian conflict. She said she passed on Mr. Trump s views to Russian diplomats in subsequent trips she s made to Moscow.Embattled Attorney General is the seventh person associated with Trump s campaign or administration with ties to Russia. Sessions lied under oath, saying that he had not spoken with Russian officials while working on Trump s campaign. Trump s son s financial connection to an entity associated with the Kremlin brings up even more questions.Donald Trump s financial debt to Russia, along with allegations that Russia is blackmailing him, and his pro-Russian political policies while praising Vladimir Putin, make the issue of releasing his taxes even more important now. American banks stopped lending the former reality show star money. Deutsche Bank, an entity who has loaned Donald a hell of a lot of money, was recently fined  502m over Russia money laundering claims.There s a reason so many Americans were concerned over Trump s massive amount of conflicts of interest. One of them being that he could be beholden to a hostile foreign entity such as Russia. But, Trump supporters wanted a man with zero political experience in office, some of them doing so in the belief that their candidate would create jobs. So far, Trump has created weekend vacations for himself, scandals and held thank you rallies. #MAGA!Photo by John Moore/Getty Images.",News,2-Mar-17
 Sniveling Coward Ted Cruz Calls Sessions’ Scandal A ‘Nothing Burger’ (VIDEO),"Attorney General Jeff Sessions  scandal is so explosive that on Thursday Congressional Republicans began breaking ranks to join Democrats in demanding that he recuse himself from overseeing an investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Sessions testified under oath that he had not spoke to Russian officials while working on Trump s campaign, but that wasn t true. Lying under oath is still against the law. Sessions marks the seventh person with Trump s campaign/administration who has been caught in a scandal related to Russia. To be sure, Sessions should not just recuse himself. He should resign.Still yet, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) defended Sessions because of course, he did.  What we are seeing is a lot of political theater,  Cruz, the man who held a reading of Green Eggs And Ham and shut down the government, said Thursday on MSNBC s  Morning Joe. Everyone is in high dudgeon about the meeting,  Cruz said.  The underlying meeting is a nothing burger. It s what senators do every day. Meeting with foreign ambassadors, that s part of the job. Sessions lied under oath about his meetings with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.Even House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) called on Sessions to recuse himself.AG Sessions should clarify his testimony and recuse himself  Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) March 2, 2017 I think everyone is getting all worked up because it s a chance to beat up the attorney general and to beat up the president,  the Texas Senator said.  But I think the underlying meeting is he is doing his job. It is not part of an Attorney General s  job  to lie under oath.Cruz said that Sessions could  been more clear  during his confirmation hearing, but said that the Attorney General is  a man of integrity, a man of candor. In contrast, Democrats such as Elizabeth Warren and House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi are calling for Sessions to resign.And we need Attorney General Jeff Sessions   who should have never been confirmed in the first place   to resign. We need it now.  Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) March 2, 2017When Sessions was a Senator in 1999, he described the perjury claims against President Bill Clinton as  serious allegations. In America, the Supreme Court and the American people believe no one is above the law,  he said at the time. Sessions went on to vote guilty  on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice during Bill Clinton s impeachment trial.Image via screen capture",News,2-Mar-17
" HE’S COMING BACK: Obama Returning To DC To Lead The Fight Against Donald Trump, And Conservatives Are TERRIFIED (SCREENSHOTS)","According to a family friend, Barack Obama has plans for that D.C. mansion he rented   and Trump is not going to like what they are. No longer the most powerful man in the world, he was just observing Trump and not liking what he saw,  the friend says. The goal is to oust Trump either by forcing him to resign or orchestrating his impeachment. According to the source, even longtime Obama confidante Valerie Jarrett is coming back to help get rid of Trump, taking up residence in a suite of rooms in Obama s home. He was weary and burned out after eight years in office. But Valerie convinced him that he didn t have any choice if he wanted to save his legacy,  the friend says.  And, as usual, he bowed to Valerie s political wisdom and advice. There was never any doubt that Valerie would have a suite of rooms in the house that the Obama s are renting,  said the source.  Obama trusts her judgment more than any other person on the planet, as does Michelle. Obama doesn t make a decision without her. He is going to use his immense popularity with the half of the country that identifies as liberals and progressives. Millions of Americans are energized and ready to take to the streets to oppose Trump, but they need to be organized and have their anger focused and directed,  says the source.  Obama is dismayed at the way Trump is tearing down his legacy ObamaCare, the social safety net and the welcome mat for refugees he put in place.  He is also not fond of Trump s cabinet picks   particularly notorious racist Jeff Sessions. He had hoped to write his memoirs, golf to his heart s content. and bask in the glory of his eight years in power and the progressive achievements he brought about. Instead, he is going to be leading the fight and strategy to topple Trump,  says the family friend.Recently, former Attorney General Eric Holder heralded the President s return: It s coming. He s coming. And he s ready to roll. This is really a battle for our democracy,  Holder says of Jeff Sessions  recent decision to no longer challenge discriminatory voting laws.  The notion that people are denied their ability to cast a meaningful vote  is inconsistent with who we say we are, inconsistent with what we say our democracy is about. Naturally, conservatives want Obama investigated and locked up or even killed  for unspecified and/or nonsensical reasons:       Trump fans are scared (and just as racist as ever). As easily the most popular President in modern history, if anyone stands a chance of successfully leading the fight against President Asterisk, it s him.",News,2-Mar-17
" The White House Just Issued A Statement On Jeff Sessions’ Treason, And It’s Absolutely SICK","Trump s newly-minted Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, is apparently just another liar who s looking out more for himself than he is justice. As the head of the Department of Justice, he should be the last person who would ever even consider lying under oath. Yet, lie he did, and now it s coming back to bite him. Democrats are all over him for it, and Trump s White House was forced to issue a statement on this.The thing is, though, that the Trump administration is wholly incapable of admitting wrongdoing in any way, shape or form. So their statement says nothing about Sessions  lies, and instead, blames one of Trump s old foes: the Democrats themselves.WH blames Sessions story on Democrats trying to damage POTUS after speech to Congress. pic.twitter.com/pZ5VcMIeEJ  Jim Acosta (@Acosta) March 2, 2017 This is the latest attack against the Trump Administration by partisan Democrats.  Oh please. If Sessions had, in fact, met with Russian diplomats in his official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, then why wouldn t he just say so? Who lies when they re sure they were well within the law and their rights to do something?Seriously. Records literally show that Sessions spoke to the Russian ambassador to the U.S. twice during Trump s presidential campaign. Nobody would lie if they truly believed they were within their legal rights (and the capacity of their job) to speak to anyone, even an enemy.The only conclusion we re left with is that Sessions lied, just like the disgraced General, Michael Flynn, lied. The White House s statement on this is typical   blaming the opposition for everything that goes wrong, including catching people committing perjury. When was the last time we had an administration lie with such impunity? Some will say Obama did, but he didn t. Trump s administration started off with lies, and it s continuing under lies. Sessions must either resign or be indicted, and Trump himself must be impeached.The treason of this administration must stop now.Featured image by Zach Gibson via Getty Images",News,2-Mar-17
 House GOP Puts DISGUSTING Restriction On Who’s Allowed To See Their New Healthcare Plan,"Paul Ryan said that the House would implement a completely transparent process for repealing and replacing Obamacare. Either Ryan has no idea what his fellow Republicans are up to, or he himself lied about this. He specifically told the  Today Show: We re not hatching some bill in a backroom and plopping it on the American people s front door. Really. There s a problem, considering that Rep. Chris Collins, of New York, said to the Washington Examiner: [The plan will] be made available Thursday morning to Republicans in a basement room of an office building that adjoins the Capitol. That s what they consider transparent? Please! What are they afraid of?According to New York Magazine, the GOP s  replacement  will absolutely rip health insurance away from millions of Americans   the same millions who were able to afford insurance under the ACA. That s especially true for low-income Americans, who benefited greatly from the ACA s expansion of Medicaid, and also the tax subsidies that went towards the cost of premiums for people who made too much for Medicaid, but too little to afford insurance any other way.In Trump s empty speech to a joint session of Congress, he reiterated the old GOP talking points of expanded health savings accounts and tax credits. The thing with those tax credits, though, is that they re based entirely on age. A 50-year old wealthy person would get the same tax credit as a 50-year old poor person. That gives the poor a lot less help than they re getting now, while the rich get a tax credit they don t need.But isn t that par for the course for the GOP? Anything to help their rich buddies, and the poor can go fuck themselves, because they really should have thought of all of this before they decided to be poor. Right? Right.Wrong. That would be part of why House Republicans only want this plan to be made available to Republicans. Democrats and everyone else would rightfully blast it for what it is   more help to the rich while leaving the poor in the dust.The rest of the problems likely have to do with insurance coverage and the deficit, but according to Collins, the House Health Subcommittee might vote on their bill before the Congressional Budget Office has a chance to release its score, so it s not yet clear who all (besides the poor) will be hurt. That would probably be another reason Republicans don t want anyone else seeing this.It s disgusting. It s ridiculous. It s manipulative. And it s classic Republicanism. They ve sunk to a low we didn t think they were capable of.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,2-Mar-17
 Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi Demands Sessions Resign Over Russian Perjury,"For months Donald Trump and his top staffers have sworn that no one in the campaign had contact with the Russian government while it was in the middle of engaging in a cyber attack against Democrats. Trump s new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, even testified under oath that he had not spoke to Russian officials while working on Trump s campaign.And that lie just got exposed.Now high ranking Democrats including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee Elijah Cummings have both called on Sessions to immediately step down. Pelosi s statement was a scorched earth condemnation of Sessions, Trump, and the entire administration which seems hell-bent on covering up its connections to Russia no matter what. Jeff Sessions lied under oath during his confirmation hearing before the Senate. Under penalty of perjury, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee,  I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.  We know that statement is false.Attorney General Sessions has never had the credibility to oversee the FBI investigation of senior Trump officials  ties to the Russians. This is why Democrats have consistently called for Sessions to recuse himself from any oversight of the investigation.Now, after lying under oath about his own communications with the Russians, the Attorney General must resign. There must be an independent, bipartisan, outside commission to investigate the Trump political, personal, and financial connection to the Russians. Cummings was equally forceful in calling for Sessions to resign, citing the fact that Michael Flynn, Trump s disgraced former National Security Advisor, had already resigned for a similar offense and Sessions  was that much worse because he kept quiet about it even after that scandal.Sessions should have the self-respect to resign, because he may be also be facing a conviction. At least one former White House ethics lawyer has already stated that he believes what Sessions did could easily send him to prison.Misleading the Senate in sworn testimony about one own contacts with the Russians is a good way to go to jail https://t.co/qH0s6sTMJ9  Richard W. Painter (@RWPUSA) March 2, 2017As Pelosi noted, Sessions  credibility was already zero and now it s under water. In a Trump administration bursting at the seams with corruption, Session has managed to stand out as particularly appalling. Republicans now need to join with Speaker Pelosi and Rep. Cummings and demand Sessions leave in disgrace.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Image",News,2-Mar-17
 Why The Hell Is Joe Manchin Still Pretending To Be A Democrat?,"When people go to the voting booth, they expect certain values to be represented when they pull the lever for someone with a (D) next to his or her name. If a candidate for office says (s)he is a Democrat, we expect that person to be pro-choice and in favor of equal rights for women, pro-LGBTQ rights, pro-criminal justice reform, in favor of raising taxes on the rich, in favor of unions and workers  rights, and in favor of comprehensive immigration reform, among other things. However, this is not always how things shake out. Case in point  West Virginia  Democrat  Joe Manchin.Manchin voted in favor of racist Jeff Sessions for Attorney General, bucking Democratic values of the defense of equal rights for all. He has also been staunchly against equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. That is just for starters, too. Manchin has consistently voted with Republicans in the Senate more than he has voted with those of his own party, and at Donald Trump s first address to a joint session of Congress, he could be seen cozying up to the bigoted president, and hopping to his feet with a standing ovation during the speech at every chance. At the end of it, he eagerly went to shake hands and kiss Trump s ass, rather than standing in solidarity with #RESISTANCE   minded Democrats.Liberal pundits and bloggers are not the only ones noticing Joe Manchin s bizarre, Republican-like behavior, either. Right-wingers believe he is just doing this stuff in order to make sure that his deep-red state re-elects him in 2018. West Virginia GOP Chair Conrad Lucas says of what Manchin is doing: It is obvious that West Virginia was the most pro-Trump state and Joe Manchin was a steadfast supporter of Hillary Clinton since Day One of the 2016 campaign and he is up for re-election in 2016, so he is going to do everything he can to mask his past. But I think voters in West Virginia are much smarter than falling for Joe Manchin. However, liberals have a different   and likely more accurate   theory of Manchin s true leanings. Progressive Change Campaign Co-Chair Adam Green Committee says: Senate Democrats running for re-election in red states will lose their general elections if they don t inspire independent voters and the Democratic base. To win in 2018, he needs to be more in touch with the times and stand up more strongly to Trump and his team of billionaires and bankers. Adam Green is correct. Someone needs to primary Manchin and defeat him. He is doing the bidding of Republicans and Donald Trump in the Senate under the guise of being a Democrat. He isn t   he s just a DINO, a wolf in sheep s clothing. I wouldn t be surprised if it turned out he voted for Trump once he was in the privacy of the voting booth.Look at candidates, not just party, folks. If you find rethugs hiding behind a (D) get rid of them.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,1-Mar-17
 Obama’s Secret Gift To The American People Could Save Our Democracy (DETAILS),"In light of the Russian hacking scandal that interfered in our nation s election, it seemed to many that the Obama administration was taking it lying down. It wasn t, at least according to a ground breaking report by the New York Times that says that in his final days, the President worked to create a trail leading directly from Russia to Donald Trump.In the Obama administration s last days, some White House officials scrambled to spread information about Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election   and about possible contacts between associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump and Russians   across the government. Former American officials say they had two aims: to ensure that such meddling isn t duplicated in future American or European elections, and to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators.Intelligence officials had suspected something fishy as early as last summer, but the evidence was still too weak. In September, though, there was a series of cyber attacks on state voting systems. That s when the administration became more vocal on the matter. That s also when Obama s intelligence departments got very serious.But it wasn t until after the election, and after more intelligence had come in, that the administration began to grasp the scope of the suspected tampering and concluded that one goal of the campaign was to help tip the election in Mr. Trump s favor. In early December, Mr. Obama ordered the intelligence community to conduct a full assessment of the Russian campaign.In the weeks before the assessment was released in January, the intelligence community combed through databases for an array of communications and other information   some of which was months old by then   and began producing reports that showed there were contacts during the campaign between Trump associates and Russian officials.While we still don t know exactly what the Obama administration knows, we do know that there are more than a handful of Trump officials, including his Attorney General, who have confirmed contacts with Russian oligarchs, spies and government officials. That s unprecedented.Congress is also taking this very seriously. The House intelligence committee is about to investigate. We have reached a written agreement, the minority and the majority in the House intelligence committee, that we will investigate allegations of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign,  Democratic Representative Adam Schiff said on MSNBC.U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded that Russia tried to help Trump win the White House by discrediting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her party through cyber attacks. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, expelled Russian diplomats in retaliation in December.The Trump administration, of course, continues to deny any involvement with the Putin administration, but it s become quite clear that without Russia, we d have a President Hillary Clinton. Russia also denies any connection, but they re also distancing themselves from the now toxic Trump.

 BOMBSHELL: Trump AG Talked To Russian Officials Twice During Campaign And LIED About It,"In what may be the beginning of the end for Donald Trump s tenure as *president, more information has just been disclosed by the Washington Post showing Trump campaign ties to Russia.According to WaPo, not only did Sessions speak with Russia, he lied about it: Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) spoke twice last year with Russia s ambassador to the United States, Justice Department officials said, encounters he did not disclose when asked about possible contacts between members of President Trump s campaign and representatives of Moscow during Sessions s confirmation hearing to become attorney general. Further: One of the meetings was a private conversation between Sessions and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak that took place in September in the senator s office, at the height of what U.S. intelligence officials say was a Russian cyber campaign to upend the U.S. presidential race. During Sessions confirmation hearing for Attorney General, he was asked if anyone from Trump s campaign had spoked or communicated with the Russian government. If you ll recall, Sessions was a big part of Trump s campaign and was often seen on the road with the now *president.Sessions responded to questions about Russian communications by saying: I m not aware of any of those activities I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians. LIE.WaPo reports: Justice officials said Sessions met with Kislyak on Sept. 8 in his capacity as a member of the armed services panel rather than in his role as a Trump campaign surrogate. However: The Washington Post contacted all 26 members of the 2016 Senate Armed Services Committee to see if any lawmakers besides Sessions met with Kislyak in 2016. Of the 19 lawmakers who responded, every senator, including chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), said they did not meet with the Russian ambassador last year. The other lawmakers on the panel did not respond as of Wednesday evening. Shady. As. F*ck.With Russian ties to the Trump campaign stacking up by the day, including one that ended in the resignation of Michael Flynn, it s becoming more apparent now, than ever, that there are very obvious ties.Trump has been trying to distract and divert attention any way that he can. He s told the press and the American people time and time again that there are no Russian ties, yet he will never say one negative word about Russia. It s alarming, the least. Hopefully we will see all the truth brought to light sooner rather than later.Featured Photo by Zach Gibson/Getty Images",News,1-Mar-17
 Veterans SHRED Trump For Exploiting Navy SEAL’s Death While Press FAWNS All Over Him For It,"Trump s address to a joint session of Congress last night was long on old and tired talking points, and short on substance and concrete plans. Many lawmakers present had invited guests, and, of course, Trump invited his own guests, too, which presidents do. One of his guests was Carryn Owens, wife of slain Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, who was lost during the botched raid in Yemen.The press fawned all over Trump for that, talking about the emotional, touching moment in which Trump actually became presidential. Then there were veterans on social media who felt differently. Many feel that Trump did nothing but exploit Ms. Owens, her grief, and the death of her husband. They were quite clear in how they saw it:       Then there s U.S. Army veteran Charles Clymer, who was so livid he went on a mini-tweetstorm about it:      But here s the press  reaction. The fawning is gag-inducing, especially  from those who routinely speak out against Trump.         That s a stark difference. Trump used Ms. Owens like he always uses people. He was trying to puff himself up, score points, and distract attention from the poorly-planned and executed Yemen raid, which even DHS says yielded no useful intelligence.Our fighting men and women put their lives on the line for us. It would be one thing if the intelligence for the Yemen raid was confirmed to be good, and the raid itself was as carefully planned and executed as it could possibly be. Things go wrong with even the best-planned missions   that s a fact. But that s not what happened in Yemen, and our military members shouldn t have to die for an administration that hastily throws an operation together, and then lies about the result. Owens deserves so much more than this, and his blood is on Trump s hands.Featured image by Jim Lo Scalzo via Getty Images",News,1-Mar-17
 Robert Reich PERFECTLY Breaks Down Trump’s 10-Step Plan For ‘Turning Lies Into Truth’ (VIDEO),"In a new video, Robert Reich breaks down the 10-step plan Donald Trump is using to turn lies into truths and how we can break the cycle.While many of us are inclined to think he is just a bumbling buffoon. Reich notes that the Wall Street Journal has refused to call Trump s lies, lies. Their reasoning? He isn t doing it on purpose, so it doesn t really count. He isn t lying intentionally. He s just an idiot who doesn t know what he s talking about. But Trump is actually succeeding at turning his many bogus falsehoods into near truths.Here s how:With this 10-step plan,  Trump wins,  Reich explains. But he doesn t have to. We each need to make sure we know the truth rather than just swallowing whatever lie Trump spouts out next. Don t let him confuse you. Trust the real facts, not the alternative ones.Reich also said that  the media should stop mincing words  and needs to  report Trump s lies as lies.

 #NeverTrump Conservative Has The PERFECT Description Of Pundits’ Reaction To Trump’s Speech (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is being graded on a curve. He always has been, as he has broken every rule in the political handbook and still managed to lie, cheat, and insult his way to the presidency. However, on Tuesday night, he delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress   his first. For the most part, he stuck to his prepared remarks, and he seemed to keep his attention span and his temperament in check. There were no nasty insults to the press, to Democrats, or to Republicans who have been critical of him. Compared to the wild, unhinged antics we ve been treated to from Trump since the day he launched his disgusting presidential campaign, this speech was surprisingly normal by Trumpian standards. This seems to be good enough for cable news personalities at this point.But, one #NeverTrump conservative, Charlie Sykes, has news for said pundits: They are looking too hard for Trump to act like a normal president   or even a normal human being   and in turn they are behaving like abused spouses. Appearing on MSNBC, Sykes said of the punditry surrounding Trump s speech: There s almost a  battered pundit syndrome  going on out there. He comes home and he s not abusive, and he s not drunk, and so we re just so incredibly grateful, it s just so incredibly good. Sykes went on to remind people that Trump s  new tone  is unlikely to go beyond that speech. He ll be back to his old, unruly self again in no time   just like a drunken, abusive spouse. To that end, we, the American people, need to treat him like an abuser, because that is just what he is, only on a grand scale.Thank you, Mr. Sykes, for reminding everyone just who and what Trump is. Splashes of seeming normalcy from him should not be treated as if the storm has passed. It will never pass with this man.Watch the exchange below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,1-Mar-17
 Dem AGs Respond To Trump Rolling Back Clean Water Rule: See You In Court!,"Amateur president Donald Trump s hostility towards the Environmental Protection Agency is revealing by his pick to head the EPA who attacked his own agency during an address to the Conservative Political Action summit last week. The former reality show star is hell bent on raping the environment, this time with an executive order directing the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers to consider rolling back a regulation aimed at protecting America s waterways from pollution.Apparently, the alleged president doesn t realize that humans need water to live. There s a price to pay for such action, such as lawsuits and that s something Trump is familiar with. But, he s about to get a ton of sh*t coming down on him via Democratic Attorney Generals for rolling back that protection on clean water.Talking Points Memo reports: We strongly oppose President Trump s action today that undermines Clean Water Act protections and the public health and environment of our states,  the attorneys general in New York, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon, Vermont and the District of Columbia said in a statement.The group of attorneys general, led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, suggested taking legal action against the Trump administration in the statement. We won t hesitate to protect our people and our environment including by aggressively opposing in court President Trump s actions that ignore both the law and the public s paramount need for clean water,  the AGs wrote. Abandoning the Clean Water Rule will allow uncontrolled pollution of these critical water resources. It could also harm the competitiveness of our state economies by forcing us to spend more to clean up the pollution of deregulated waters coming from upstream states that refuse to control such pollution,  they added in the statement.As for Scott Pruitt, Trump s pick as Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, it was recently revealed that he used a private email to conduct state business while he was attorney general in Oklahoma and lied about it under oath. Trump picked a man to head the EPA who previously   wait for it   sued the EPA 13 times.Trump and Pruitt are dangerous for our environment.Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images.",News,1-Mar-17
" Michael Moore GOES OFF On Trump’s Speech, Blasts Him For This One SICK Moment (VIDEO)","While some have Donald Trump critics have claimed that the unworthy POTUS  address to Congress may have actually saved his epically failing presidency and have commented that Trump actually looked presidential for once, liberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore had an entirely different opinion.In an appearance on MSNBC, Moore tore into Trump and pointed out why no one should be impressed with the disgusting trick Trump pulled on America. Commenting on the moment in which Trump gave a salute to fallen Navy Seal William  Ryan  Owens, Moore mocked Trump and said: My ratings. Record applause. I m going to get an Emmy for this. Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch. The sickness of this man That moment received a standing ovation, but Moore was less than impressed. Moore accused Trump of inviting Owens  wife, widow Carryn Owens, to be present at the address so he could  use  her as a prop to distract from the fact that the mission that got Owens killed was 100% Trump s fault and was a massive failure. Moore said: That s why she s there, as sort of an  f-you  to the people who are criticizing him for this. And this poor woman, this widow who has lost her husband, she is in desperate grief right now.To use that to put another notch on his belt   and what is he thinking about? The filmmaker also trashed Trump for his complete lack of empathy: To a malignant narcissist you re not ever thinking that you re insulting anybody because it s all about you. That would require empathy. You can watch Moore put Trump on blast below:While a CNN/ORC poll stated that 78 percent of participants thought that Trump s speech was positive, no one can argue that Moore has a point here. Trump will do anything and exploit anyone to detract from his f*ck ups, and he doesn t care how distasteful it is.Featured image via Theo Wargo and Joe Raedle/ Getty Images ",News,1-Mar-17
 Nancy Pelosi BRILLIANTLY Points Out the Brutal FAIL In Trump’s Address To Congress (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s join address to Congress last night left much to be desired, and many Democratic leaders are absolutely disgusted by what they heard and witnessed from the undeserving POTUS.In response to Trump s pathetic speech, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has received the following statement, which blatantly calls Trump out for being untrustworthy and fake. Pelosi wrote: The President s speech was utterly disconnected from the cruel reality of his conduct. And she s absolutely right. Trump s speech was completely disconnected from what he has done so far, and Pelosi accurately assessed Trump s address as a  bait-and-switch assault on America.  She also brilliantly pointed out that Trump has yet to actually back up any of his campaign promises and proposals.Pelosi also called Trump out for  selling working people down the river to Wall Street  and for jeopardizing  the security of our country  and weakening  our fight against terror with his Administration s dangerous, incompetent and unconstitutional actions.  Those are harsh words, but they re absolutely true and reflect how the majority of Americans feel about Trump s first few weeks in the White House. At the end of her statement, Pelosi warned Trump that  Democrats will continue to lead the fight  against his disgusting rhetoric and harmful policies.Echoing Pelosi s statement, colleague Chuck Schumer also held a similar opinion of Trump s address to Congress:Unlike Trump, who is infamous for walking back and flip-flopping on his stances to please the masses, Pelosi only doubled down on her comments earlier this morning in an appearance on MSNBC s  Morning Joe . Commenting on Trump s lack of concrete policies, she said,  We re legislators. Show us your proposal. Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,1-Mar-17
" Trump’s Attorney General Says THC Causes ‘Real Violence,’ Indicates Legal Cannabis Crackdown Is Coming","Breaking news out of Trump s White House indicates that marijuana use may have contributed to the violent events at Bowling Green and perhaps even in Sweden.At least, in the opinion of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, that could be the case. Despite repeated promises by Trump on the campaign trail to leave states alone that have legalized recreational cannabis, the Trump administration appears to be gearing up to take aim at the legal marijuana industry. On Monday, he told reporters at the Justice Department that  real violence  is connected to cannabis use:Sessions further said that experts have told him there is  more violence around marijuana,  than one would think. You can t sue somebody for a drug debt,  Sessions said, on Monday.  The only way to get your money is through strong-arm tactics, and violence tends to follow that. (Business Insider) I don t think America is going to be a better place when people of all ages, and particularly young people, are smoking pot,  Sessions said.  I believe it s an unhealthy practice, and current levels of THC in marijuana are very high compared to what they were a few years ago, and we re seeing real violence around that. If he was just a tiny bit smarter, he d realize he s actually arguing in favor of legalization. I live in Portland, Oregon. Here s a couple of notes about the recreational dispensary located a convenient four blocks from my house   first, they are a small business. Small businesses aren t in the habit of fronting people inventory; you typically pay for what you re purchasing, and leave. The second point here is going to require a bit of imagination.Let s imagine that they have fronted me untold amounts of cannabis, and I haven t paid. So they send a strongman to my house to get the money and I just call the cops, because weed is legal, I m not incriminating myself by calling, and using  strong-arm tactics  to get money you are owed is illegal. Federal courts aren t going to treat it as a legitimate product, sure, but the answer to that is complete legalization, not wasting millions of dollars in pointless enforcement and court battles with individual states.He said some other genuinely dumb shit as well:Sessions then appeared to criticize a column The Washington Post published Tuesday by Sam Kamin, professor of marijuana law and policy at the University of Denver. In the op-ed, Kamin argues that the opioid crisis is  a reason to expand access to marijuana rather than to contract it.  A 2016 study from Columbia University s Mailman School of Public Health found  adverse consequences of opioid use  decreased over time in states where marijuana is legalized as individuals substituted marijuana for opioids to treat pain.But Sessions scoffed at Kamin s reasoning. Give me a break,  Sessions said.  This is the kind of argument that has been out there. [It s] almost a desperate attempt to defend the harmlessness of marijuana or even benefits. I doubt that s true. Maybe science will prove me wrong.   My best view is that we don t need to be legalizing marijuana. Well, Sessions, science has, indeed, proved you wrong. Your  best view  is both behind the times and demonstrably false. There is so much information out there demonstrating the benefits of cannabis in combating the opiate epidemic and treating chronic pain that if you re the Attorney General, and ignorant of it, it s by choice.It s time for the failed war on drugs to draw to a close. All prohibition of cannabis accomplishes is driving people who self-medicate or are prescribed cannabis for chronic pain to use prescription opiates instead, finances the cartels and fuels violence, and makes the Fox News crowd happy. The  gateway drug  shtick is old and false. Sean Spicer and Jeff Sessions think that increased recreational use of cannabis has led to the opiate epidemic, rather than excessive and improper prescriptions (as evidence shows). This is so wrong and out-of-touch that it shows they have no interest in  actually helping or rehabilitating heroin and oxy addicts   they are only interested in using them as a political prop that justifies attacking rights they don t believe people should have. So much for  small government,  eh?Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",News,1-Mar-17
" Ivanka Trump’s Dress Was Nice, But There Was One MAJOR Problem With It (VIDEO)","A consistent theme among Donald Trump s rhetoric, and last night s address to Congress was no different, is economic nationalism, which means  buy and hire American.  As usual, though, the words were contradicted by his own family s actions, and in particular, his favorite child, Ivanka, who wore a lovely dress that was made, of course, in the United Kingdom and designed by a French designer.Getting ready to leave The White House with @realdonaldtrump as he prepares to address Congress #JointSession pic.twitter.com/vlR1wPHGkK  Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) March 1, 2017Ivanka Trump, the President s eldest daughter who is said to be his  favourite  child, wore a fuchsia dress by French designer Roland Mouret which cost $1868 ( 1772) to the prestigious event which saw her father promise a  new chapter of American greatness  and launch barbed attacks on illegal immigrants.A representative for the acclaimed designer, Roland Mouret, told The Independent the Rawlings Dress which was worn by the first daughter was produced in the UK.Source: IndependentNot everyone thought the dress was appropriate because it was cocktail length rather than formal, and it showed her shoulders after Michelle Obama was so widely criticized on the right for daring to show her arms.

It s hypocrisy at its worst and rather than apologize for it, the Trumps flaunt it, just like they flaunt the ethics surrounding the presidency.Featured image via Twitter screen capture",News,1-Mar-17
 Trump Fan Violently Attacks Comedian For Harmless Joke (VIDEO),"Comedian John Caparulo was in the middle of a perfectly normal standup act at The Comedy & Magic Club in Hermosa Beach, California when someone was apparently too stupid to get his joke about Donald Trump and reacted violently. The Washington Monument, somebody got paid to design that shit? It s a fucking pencil, it s just a big cement pencil,  Caparulo said. Some people think it looks like a dick but I think they re saving that design for Trump s monument.  Though the majority of the audience laughed uproariously, two women decided that Mr. Caparulo was a goddamn traitor. Fuck you,  one of the women yelled, apparently unable to summon enough of her insignificant brainpower to form a snappy comeback. No fuck you stupid, what are you his fucking mom? Get the fuck out of here,  Caparulo replied, seeminly bemused by this woman s shock that someone doesn t like the least popular president in American history.  Oh god, am I the first one to dislike Trump? Oh my god, I must ve invented disliking Trump  Fucking break up my show lady, you can come up here and do this shit. Go fuck yourself,  the woman screamed as she threw her glass at Caprulo   a sure sign that it s probably a bad idea to give these people alcohol that isn t in a sippy cup. The glass shattered when it hit the comedian. That hurt a little bit,  he said, laughing.  I ll have to admit that hurt. Thank you, she was a bitch all night,  one audience member yelled as the Trump fan left. Others agreed with her.  Fuck you,  one yelled.  Fuck Trump,  another added.Unfortunately, this is the mindset of Trump fans. Everything they don t like is met with violence because, at least according to studies, Trump fans are too stupid to know they are stupid. They lash out. They threaten. They scream. They throw fits.

While Trump may be patting himself on the back, those of us who can operate a toaster without an adult supervising are a bit confused at whom, exactly, he thinks likes him.

 Publisher Announces Books By The Obamas Are Officially On The Way,"Penguin Random House announced on Tuesday night that Barack and Michelle Obama have both signed book deals with the publisher. According to the statement, the former president and former first lady will each be authoring a book in the near future.The announcement reads: Penguin Random House is pleased to announce that it will publish forthcoming books by former President of the United States Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama. Oenguin Random House CEO MArkus Dohle announced today that the company has acquired world publication rights for two books, to be written by President and Mrs. Obama respectively. The statement did not disclose an actual dollar amount for these deals, but according to a report in Financial Times, bids on their books had reached more than $60 million. If accurate, this would blow away the price tag attached to the memoirs of other recent presidents. Bill Clinton got $15 million for his book My Life and George W Bush made approximately $10 million from his book Decision Points.The announcement did say that  in support of the mission of The Obama Foundation and Penguin Random House s own commitment to social responsibility, the company will donate one million books in the Obama family s name to First Book. The First Book program strives to  promote equal access to education by providing new books, learning materials, and other essentials to children in need. In addition,  the Obamas also plan to donate a significant portion of their author proceeds to charity. We are absolutely thrilled to continue our publishing partnership with President and Mrs. Obama,  Dohle said.  With their words and their leadership, they changed the world, and every day, with the books we publish at Penguin Random House, we strive to do the same. Now, we are very much looking forward to working together with President and Mrs. Obama to make each of their books global publishing events of unprecedented scope and significance. This is not the first time the former president has worked with the publisher. CNN points out that Penguin Random House has published Obama s past books,  so the new deal continues a two-decade-long relationship. The hefty figures quoted in the bids for their books clearly demonstrate the expectation that these books are going to be huge best sellers. Personally, I have only one question: Where can I place a pre-order?New books by @BarackObama and @MichelleObama have been acquired by @penguinrandom, the publisher says. pic.twitter.com/EkF5cfRaOH  Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) February 28, 2017Featured image via Mike Theiler-Pool/Getty Images",News,28-Feb-17
 WATCH: Keith Olbermann Goes On EPIC Pre-Trump Address Rant With An AWESOME Twist At The End,"Keith Olbermann rants on a very regular basis. Tonight s rant, on his video series, was extremely on point given that Trump will give a State-Of-The-Union-esque address to Congress this evening where he will likely talk about one of our biggest controversies: Immigration.He spends most of the address calling Trump s immigration orders a  Muslim ban,  and a  purge of Hispanics.  He s not wrong, and he lays out exactly why he s not wrong with example after example: When you detain an American born in Philadelphia and ask him over and over again,  Where did you get your name from,  and,  Are you Muslim,  and the man s name is Muhammad Ali Jr., it s a Muslim ban! When ICE agents reportedly wait across the street from a Virginia church refuge designed to save the homeless from freezing to death on our streets, and you grab six men as they leave the place, it is a purge of Hispanics! He goes back and forth between  Muslim ban,  and  purge of Hispanics,  through his rant, with each example of the truth of these words worse than the one before. A couple of his examples have background to them that he doesn t lay out, which makes them misleading. However. The gist of the entire video is the truth.He also explains that one of the biggest things Trump s stance on immigration has done is start turning rank-and-file ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers, and U.S. Border Patrol agents   who may not even know any better   into power-tripping sadists under the false belief that they re still doing something moral.But his final sentence is the kicker.

 Trump Suggests White Anti-Semites NOT Attacking Jews – Who He Thinks It Is Will Make You Sick,"There s been a spate of attacks on Jews around the U.S. recently, including destroying Jewish cemeteries and issuing bomb threats to Jewish community centers and synagogues. Trump did condemn rising anti-Semitism, but when asked about this growing threat earlier today, he suggested that something else could be happening. And it s just flat-out sick.In a meeting with several states  attorneys general, he said: Sometimes it s the reverse, to make people or to make others look bad. While he hasn t clarified what he actually means by this, it sounds pretty clear. He thinks either that the Jewish community itself is doing this (why, we don t know), or liberals are behind this to frame his white nationalist, Neo-Nazi, KKK and anti-Semitic followers. He said it was  reprehensible,  according to Pennsylvania s attorney general, but it s clear he d rather believe in some kind of conspiracy than the fact that his supporters include people who want to eradicate everyone who isn t straight, cis, white and Christian.BREAKING: PA Attorney General: Trump told us  sometimes it s the reverse,  when asked about anti-Semitic threats and attacks. pic.twitter.com/Pjo8FE59iN  Chris Geidner (@chrisgeidner) February 28, 2017Shapiro says Trump used the word  reverse  two or three times in his remarks. That really does imply that he thinks Jews might be doing this to themselves (for what? Sympathy? Come on) because what s the reverse of being an attack victim? Being the attacker. How vile and sick do you have to be to suggest that?The White House, however, claims he didn t suggest that at all. They did say that he thinks protesters probably his phantom professional liberal protesters are behind it.

" The Vacationer-In-Chief Was Asked To Grade His First Month In Office, And It’s RIDICULOUS","Amateur president Donald Trump s first thirty days in office have been chaotic, ill-prepared and downright embarrassing. A list of polls released this past week shows a mostly negative view of Trump s behavior as an alleged president so far, and given his actions, it s only going to get worse. One poll shows that a majority of Americans are embarrassed by Trump s behavior. Another poll by Quinnipiac University found a majority of voters say that he does not act level-headed. Still, Trump thinks he s doing a fantastic job.When he was asked how he would grade his administration through its first four-plus weeks, Trump suggested that he has been a high achiever. The former reality show star-turned-alleged president said he would give himself an A for effort and achievement, but just a C or a C+ on his ability to communicate his successes to the American people, according to Politico. In terms of achievement, I think I d give myself an A. Because I think I ve done great things   I and my people, but I don t think we ve explained it well enough to the American public,  Trump said in an interview on  Fox and Friends  Tuesday. I think I give myself an A in terms of what I ve actually done,  Trump added.But Trump seemed to think he s just been an average messenger. In terms of messaging, I would give myself a C or a C+,  he said.Trump also gave himself an A+ for  effort. But results are more important (than effort),  he added.As for the protests that have erupted nationwide, Trump blamed hurt feelings from the results of the 2016 presidential election. Trump added that he intends to bring the country together.  The way you do that is through success,  he said, vowing to boost jobs and replace the Affordable Care Act.About Obamacare: Angry constituents have shown up at town hall meetings across the country. When you take someone s healthcare away, they re not happy and it s not a unifying moment. The GOP replacement is so bad that even the number three Republican in the House vowed not to sign off on it. Trump may indeed be bringing the country together   against him. And for the fake president who vowed to work hard and never vacation as president, he has taken weekends off and repeatedly gone golfing. On weekends, he hangs out at his Mar-a-Lago resort surrounded by his rich guests.According to the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, former President Barack Obama s travel costs during his eight years in office totaled about $97 million. If Trump maintains his current pace, he ll outspend Obama in less than one year.

" Jon Stewart Brilliantly Reveals Trump’s MAJOR Character Flaw, And It’s SO True (VIDEO)","Jon Stewart may not be routinely commenting on America s politics anymore, but he certainly hasn t stepped away from the spotlight. Last night, Stewart took a break from his personal projects to hijack Stephen Colbert s The Late Show, where he couldn t resist weighing in on Donald Trump.During the show, Stewart nailed a personality trait of Trump s that shows just how untrustworthy Trump is. While it s well known that Trump lies through his teeth every chance he gets (he was also proven to be the most dishonest presidential candidate last year), there s one behavior of Trump s that gives it all away   and Stewart pointed this out perfectly. Mocking one of Trump s most obvious speech patterns, Stewart said: Nobody says  believe me  unless they are lying. He elaborated: Trump lies more in one press conference than CNN does in a year. And this is coming from a guy, who as you know, hates CNN. Stewart also had some equally harsh words for the media, and advised the press that it should  get its groove back  and stop latching onto Trump s every attack. Stewart said to the media: Let s face facts. You kind of let yourself go a little bit these past few years, put on a few pundits, obsessing 24 hours a day, seven days a week, about this one guy:  What s Donnie up to? Did he say anything about us? You think he s gonna come on our show?' Stewart compared the behavior between Trump and the media to a bad breakup, and suggested that it was an opportunity for improvement. Stewart said,  Take up a hobby. I recommend journalism! Colbert asked Stewart if he felt the press would actually do some self-reflection and improve, and Stewart joked, I really do   believe me.

" Trump TRASHES Sean Spicer’s Cell Phone Checks, Signals Trump Team Implosion (VIDEO)","The Trump team is caving in on itself, and Donald Trump s latest comments certainly won t help.Earlier today, Trump appeared on Fox & Friends where he blatantly criticized White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Addressing the mysterious and numerous leaks that have been coming out of the White House, Spicer was reported to be checking the professional and personal cell phones of White House staffers in the West Wing to make sure they weren t involved in leaking any information. It was a drastic move, and we ve never seen such distrust within an administration, and yet Trump still claims everything in the White House is running like a  well-oiled machine.  But something tells us that after Spicer hears what Trump just said, things are going to change.In his exclusive White House interview, Trump admitted that he wouldn t have handled the leaks the way Spicer did. Steve Doocey asked Trump: Sean Spicer asked his communication team,  Alright come on in everybody. Put your phone right over there. We have a leaker here. We re gonna have the White House lawyer look at your phones.  How intent are you on finding who the leaker or leakers are in your administration? Not just your communications team, but over at the State Department, maybe the intel community, everywhere? Trump first bragged about how great his press secretary was (even though there have been several reports that state Trump is unhappy with Spicer s performance and would rather replace him with a woman). He said, Well first of all, Sean Spicer is a fine human being. He s a fine person. Then Trump criticized Spicer: I would have done it differently. I would have gone one-on-one with different people. I would have handled it different than Sean, but Sean handles it his way, and I m OK with it. Hinting that he felt Spicer was going far too easy on staffers, Trump joked that if it were up to him,  there are things you can do that are a hell of a lot worse.

 The White House’s Attack On The Media Just Got VERY Personal And Illegal,"It s no secret that the Trump administration (and Donald Trump himself) sees itself as a victim of a malicious mainstream media, when all the media has been guilty of is reporting the truth and of simply asking questions about the many scandals surrounding the administration. Now, it appears, the White House has taken the fight against the media to a brand new low. The administration that constantly complains about  fake news  planted at least one story with the intention of trashing a political reporter. That s libel.It all began with a report in Politico by Annie Karni and Alex Isenstadt on Sunday, in which it was reported that amid a frantic search for leaks, Spicer told his staffers to dump their phones for a  phone check.  He also threatened his staffers with more problems if the phone check was leaked to the media. It was. Spicer also reportedly made a deputy communications director cry.Within the communications office, the mood has grown tense. During a recent staff meeting, Spicer harshly criticized some of the work deputy communications director Jessica Ditto had done, causing her to cry, according to two people familiar with the incident.  The only time Jessica recalls almost getting emotional is when we had to relay the information on the death of Chief Ryan Owens,  Spicer said, referring to the Navy SEAL killed recently in action in Yemen.Ditto also denied the accounts.  This is 100 percent not true,  she said Sunday after the incident was reported.  Sean and I have a great working relationship. Soon after that story was released, an article appeared in the conservative Washington Examiner that smeared Isenstadt, saying he laughed at the dead of the Navy Seal. The Examiner article, of course, cited an unnamed source.My goodness, this is obvious what s going on here. https://t.co/c8nF0oYigB  Steven Ginsberg (@stevenjay) February 27, 2017 He started laughing about that SEAL,  said one informed official, also upset at Politico s  insulting  description of Ditto in the story as a  more junior spokesperson. The irony is rich from an administration whose leader, on the very same day this story was released, said he wanted to ban journalists from using anonymous sources. If you recall your history, Nixon was taken down because of an anonymous source. It s an important tool in journalism. Of course, there was that time Trump accused Obama of being foreign born because of anonymous sources who clearly never existed. I guess Trump has a good reason to distrust anonymous sources since he lies behind them.As for Isenstadt, while he might have a great case for libel, there s no word yet as to whether he ll sue.Featured image via Aaron P.

 Betsy DeVos Gets WRECKED After Praising Segregated Schools As ‘Pioneers Of School Choice’ (TWEETS),"Donald Trump s education secretary proved she is spectacularly unfit for her job when she released a statement on her department s website praising historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) as   real pioneers when it comes to school choice. In some ways, this is an accurate statement. White people, for example,  chose  to exclude black people from educational opportunities, so if African-Americans wanted education they needed to  choose  to form their own schools. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality,  she continued, failing to note that the difference in quality started with  no education  thanks to the racist Jim Crow-era education system.  Their success has shown that more options help students flourish. Their success is an example of the great things that can happen when people band together to overcome adversity, but HBCUs have nothing to do with  school choice  as DeVos claims.Naturally, people were quick to point out the extreme racism that was behind DeVos  statement.@nktpnd betsy devos: ""rosa parks is a real pioneer when it comes to seat choice""  Sam Deutsch (@samdman95) February 28, 2017Betsy DeVos said HBCUs were about school choice.

This persistent inequality has led some states, including Maryland and Mississippi, to be sued for failing to fund black and white public colleges at equal levels. These schools were the only option for many people. That isn t  choice    that s a problem, and we will likely never see Mc.

 ‘Hundreds’ Donated To Planned Parenthood In Right-Wing Pastor’s Name And It’s Driving Him INSANE (VIDEO),"People have figured out a way to troll a right-wing pastor who incessantly rails against transgender Americans, Planned Parenthood, and pretty much anything else that doesn t fit into his pathetic, bigoted world view and help the women s health organization at the same time and it s driving him bananas. Recently, far-Right hate pastor Greg Locke posted an allcaps message on his Facebook timeline:PLANNED PARENTHOOD SENT ME A PERSONAL  THANK YOU  AND IT HAS ME LIT.And boy is he  lit!  Locke explains that he received the  thank you  letter from his favorite  baby parts  boogeyman after an an undisclosed amount was donated in his honor by a woman named Krista Ginsberg in Houston, Texas. At the end of the day, it doesn t matter how big or how small it was, it was a waste of your money and the stamp was a waste of your money,  Locke raves in the video.  Don t ever send me anymore nonsense from Planned Parenthood. There has never been an organization in the world that has killed more innocent people other than radical Islam than that of Planned Parenthood,  Locke lied. Naturally, he did not cite a source for the claim.  Look, I m just gonna say it whether you like it or not   Planned Parenthood does not give one flip of a wooden nickel about women s healthcare. It s a bunch of deceptive individuals that are in it for the money that have been known to sell baby parts on the black market and they have done nothing but butcher innocent lives for years. It s safe to assume that Locke was referencing abortion there, which is only three percent of the total services Planned Parenthood provides women. The organization absolutely has not  been known  outside of certain circles of people who can barely operate a fork without adult supervision to sell  baby parts on the black market.  Previously, the organization accepted reimbursements to cover the costs of preparing and shipping donated fetal tissue, but it has since stopped accepting the reimbursements because of liars and zealots like Locke. As far as I m concerned, I don t care if I ever get another piece of literature from you guys again because you re just wasting your money to send me this nonsense,  Locke says, adding that  Pastor Greg Locke has absolutely positively tee-totally nothing to  do with Planned Parenthood. Y all can keep butchering babies, I m gonna keep speaking the truth,  he concludes after throwing the nice thank you letter in the garbage.Apparently, some awesome people decided to get together and go to Planned Parenthood s donation page, where they filled out the form and made a donation   of course carefully checking the  Yes, my gift is in honor or in memory of someone special  box where they entered Locke s information and the address of his church (2060 Old Lebanon Dirt Rd in Mt. Juliet, TN zip code 37122) so Planned Parenthood knew where to send their thanks. not that we re encouraging you to do it or anything. You should totally do it.Within a week of his initial posting, Locke complained about all the love he is getting from enthusiastic supporters of women s healthcare. Apparently, there have been  HUNDREDS OF DONATIONS  in his name.Not only is this a win for Planned Parenthood, but the look on Locke s face in the video is worth every cent that is donated.Watch Locke s unhinged ravings below:Featured image via screengrab",News,28-Feb-17
" Military Officials: Trump LIED, Botched Yemen Raid Yielded No Significant Intelligence At All","On Monday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer responded to the concerns of the father of the Navy SEAL who died in Trump s disastrous raid in Yemen by blaming him for his own death   but he claimed it was worth it because we recovered valuable intelligence that will save American lives and prevent terrorist attacks. I can tell him on behalf of the President, his son died a hero and the information that he was able to help obtain through that raid is going to save American lives; it s going to protect our country more,  Spicer said, adding that Ryan Owens was responsible for his own death: It s something that as a SEAL and as somebody who deployed 12 times, he knew that this was part of the job and he knew what he was doing. It is almost certain that Owens knew that there was risk involved in his job, but he also relies on the Commander-in-Chief to know what he11-year-old boy is doing. The raid killed 30 civilians (and half as many militants), including about 10 women and children   according to witnesses, an was the first to be struck by a bullet   and completely failed to kill al Qaeda leader Qassim Al-Rimi, who took to mocking The Donald in propaganda videos after the embarrassment that was the Yemen raid. Our forces ultimately recovered a few videos that have been available on YouTube for a decade. Trump s first military operation was such a massive disaster that Yemen revoked the United States  permission to conduct ground-based anti-terrorism operations within the country s borders. Why at this time did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasn t even barely a week into [President Trump s] administration?  Bill Owens, the father of the slain SEAL, said of the raid.  For two years prior   everything was missiles and drones (in Yemen) .Now all of a sudden we had to make this grand display? Why such a grand display? Because this is what  success  looks like in Trump s America, of course!Despite Spicer and Trump s numerous claims that the mission was hugely successful, senior military officials tell NBC that they are unaware of any  actionable intelligence  that was recovered during the raid: We gathered an unbelievable amount of intelligence that will prevent the potential deaths or attacks on American soil,  said Spicer.A Defense Department official also pushed back Monday afternoon, saying the raid has yielded  a significant amount  of intelligence.But the only example the military has provided turned out to be an old bomb-making video that was of no current value.On Monday, Spicer addressed the remarks of Bill Owens, whose son died. I can tell him that on behalf of the president, his son died a hero and the information that he was able to help obtain through that raid, as I said before, is going to save American lives,  he said.  The mission was successful in helping prevent a future attack or attacks on this nation. Multiple senior officials told NBC News they have not seen evidence to support that claim.It s one thing to authorize a mission with insufficient intelligence or support. It s another to lie to the family of someone your negligence killed and call it a  success. Ryan Owens was a hero   but his country failed him. His President failed him. And someone must answer for it.Featured image via Getty Images/Drew Angerer",News,27-Feb-17
" The Washington Post Just Asked A MAJOR Question Of Trump’s Administration, And He’ll Be LIVID","Trump s young administration is fraught with trouble, but we all knew that already. Most of us probably haven t thought of just how to frame Trump s behavior since assuming the White House, but an enterprising writer at the Washington Post just did. Eugene Robinson, an opinion writer for the Post, wrote an entire op-ed based around the following question: Does Trump know he s president? Well, does he? One of the things that Robinson points to as evidence that he doesn t, or, at least, doesn t know what he s doing at all, is the fact that we had a bunch of government executives tell Europe, tell Iraq, even tell the U.N., not to listen to what Trump says. For instance, he said we re going to take Iraq s oil. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told the press in Baghdad that we were absolutely not there to do that.U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said that we absolutely support a two-state solution after Trump said we didn t. Mike Pence told NATO that we re fully devoted to them, after Trump has said repeatedly that NATO is obsolete and wants to cozy up to Russia.He said that rounding up undocumented immigrants is  a military operation,  which supposedly means a  non-military operation,  and he was just using  military  as an adjective, according to Sean Spicer.Not mentioned in Robinson s article is Trump s neverending Twitter temper tantrum, though he does mention Trump s feud with the press.  There s also the fact that Trump loves hobnobbing with his rich buddies in Florida, to the point where he had a meeting on North Korea in plain view of his VIPs, who pay him a ton of money. He won t divest from his businesses, which is creating massive conflicts of interest and may even be in violation of the Constitution.He rushed out his Muslim ban and the courts promptly halted it, and we have to wonder if he even consulted with anyone knowledgeable about the law with that. The 9th Circuit just rejected the Justice Department s request to put that case on hold pending a new order.So when the Post has to ask if Trump even knows he s president, we have to wonder the same thing. We also have to assume that Trump will be pissed if he hears about this op-ed because it makes him look like the buffoon he is, and he already hates the Post. Not as much as The New York Times or CNN, but he hates them enough. The answer to Robinson s question is,  No, he doesn t know he s president, especially not in the same way every other president we ve had knew they were president.

" Paul Ryan Just Dropped The PERFECT Bombshell On Trump, HUMILIATES Him Over Russia (VIDEO)","Earlier today, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan dropped a truth bomb that absolutely humiliated Donald Trump and made him look like a moron.After he had a meeting with the undeserving Trump, Ryan was later asked about the calls for a prosecutor to look into Russia s interference in the U.S. election, which the intelligence community has reported extensively on.Trump has denied over and over again that Russia meddled in the U.S. election, and has repeatedly shot down and offended the CIA and other intelligence organizations in order to protect Russia and his favorite tyrant, Vladimir Putin. So when Ryan responded to the question with the exact opposite stance that Trump has taken, it made the former reality television star look even more foolish than before. Clearly, this is yet another thing that the Republican Party is divided on right now.Ryan stated very bluntly that Russia without a doubt DID mess with the U.S. election on Trump s behalf, further embarrassing Trump for his ridiculous defense of the country. Ryan said: We know Russia meddled in the election. No one is disputing that. And this last government gave us that information in the first place. No one is alleging that some American was in on it beforehand. And yet, there s still a little problem with Ryan s statement   the part where he says  no one is disputing that.  Let s remind him that just yesterday, Trump tried to convince everyone that all this  Russia talk is FAKE NEWS  and blamed the Democratic Party and media for being petty and bitter over the election loss.Trump is seriously delusional, and Ryan s statement perfectly illustrates that the Republican Party is splitting from Trump in many ways, unable to agree with his insanity. Looks like Trump is alone in defending Russia, and the GOP doesn t care if they make him look like an idiot anymore.

 Trump’s EPA Admin GUILTY Of Lying To Congress During His Confirmation – Republicans SILENT,"One would think that, after all the accusations that Hillary lied to Congress about everything in all of creation, they d be especially sensitive to anybody else lying to them. Especially when it s easily proven. Trump s pick to head the EPA, Scott Pruitt, used a private email account for some of his government business during his tenure as Oklahoma s attorney general. It s not illegal for him to use private email under Oklahoma law as long as the emails are made publicly available, but they weren t, and he lied to Congress about it anyway.Pruitt answered a written questionnaire that asked him whether he used private email. He responded with: I use only my official OAG email address and government issued phone to conduct official business. He later told the Senate Energy and Public Works Committee that he didn t know why a personal email address was listed as part of his business addresses. 7,500 pages of emails, presumably from that address, have been released after an Oklahoma judge ruled that Pruitt had been withholding them illegally.Senate Democrats say this raises serious questions about Pruitt s credibility, which is already on shaky ground because he was suing the EPA as Oklahoma s attorney general. One of the concerns about his emails is that he was working closely with fossil fuel companies to resist the government s efforts to limit carbon emissions   something the fossil fuel industry and all its lackeys hate because it hurts profits.That s a serious conflict of interest, and lies about it just compound the whole situation.Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said of Pruitt s credibility: Now that he is in charge of protecting clean air and water in every community across the country, the public must decide for themselves whether they can trust Pruitt when he can t even be honest about his email or his ties to the oil and gas industry. Sen. John Barasso, a Wyoming Republican, wouldn t comment on the matter and other Republicans appear to be silent as well. Why? Likely because they want someone at the EPA who s willing to render it toothless, if not dismantle it entirely, and also because this reflects extremely badly on them given their insistence that Hillary s use of private email was the world s worst crime ever.Pruitt will probably remain at the head of the EPA even though lying to Congress is perjury. Republicans never want to admit when they ve screwed up.Featured image by Aaron P. Bernstein via Getty Images",News,27-Feb-17
 Trump’s Moronic ‘FAKE NEWS’ Attacks Accidentally Send New York Times Subscriptions ‘Though The Roof’,"Donald Trump may be trying to destroy the  failing  New York Times, but it seems that his rhetoric has just made the publication more popular than ever, sending subscriptions  though the roof  according to an editor.These days, any publication that prints something Trump doesn t like is anything ranging from  fake news  to  FAKE NEWS  to  VERY FAKE NEWS  (Trump has never provided a guide to how he defines each of the terms)   and the New York Times is one of his favorite targets for criticism what with all the truth-telling and whatnot.Over the weekend, Trump said the New York Times   which has won more than 100 Pulitzer Prizes   is  failing. But the newspaper s executive editor Dean Baquet says it s actually quite the opposite   and Trump is helping immensely. Trump is the best thing to happen to the Times  subscription strategy,  Baquet says.  Every time he tweets it drives subscriptions wildly. Our digital subscriptions are through the roof, our print subscriptions are up.  But he warns that it is important to realize the motivation behind Trump s statements, no matter how much The Donald is driving subscriptions: If you look at the pattern of the president s tweets, they re actually designed to minimize the institutions who are charged with holding him accountable, and I think that s dangerous. Baquet also hit back at Trump s recent demonization of anonymous sources: In an administration that has expressed so much distaste for the press and so much distaste for our role, are you surprised that some of the people who want to criticise the administration want to do it without their names attached? I m not. He s been an anonymous source throughout his career, especially when it helped him and when it burnished his reputation,  he added, referencing Trump s habit of providing information   true or not   under fake names.On Monday, Sean Spicer clarified that all press isn t, as Trump says,  the enemy of the American people.  Only the New York Times and Politico and all the other organizations Trump calls  fake news    in other words, those who criticize him   are the  enemy. It is clear what Trump is doing. It is clear that he needs to be stopped. Let s make that happen.Featured image via Getty Images/Chip Somodevilla",News,27-Feb-17
 Reince Priebus Facing Misconduct Complaint For Interfering With FBI’s Russia Investigation,"Reince Priebus, Donald Trump s chief of staff, is now facing a misconduct complaint related to his decision to interfere with the FBI s investigation of Russia.Attorney J. Whitfield Larrabee filed the complaint with the Wisconsin Office of Lawyer Regulation regarding Priebus  attempt to persuade the FBI to favor Trump in their investigation of the Russian scandal that has plagued the administration.The complaint reads:There is probable cause to charge attorney Reince Priebus ( Priebus ) with violations of Wisconsin s Rules of Professional Conduct for Attorneys, Supreme Court Rules, Chapter 20. The violations of these rules relate to Priebus  corrupt attempt to influence investigations by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) into criminal activity involving associates of Donald J. Trump ( Trump ) and Russian government officials. .It is a violation of SCR 20:8.4 (b) for a lawyer to  commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.  It is a violation of SCR 20:8.4 (c)  to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.  There is probable cause to charge Priebus with such serious violations of these particular ethical requirements that it will be necessary and appropriate to revoke his license to practice of law if the charges are established.Larrabee explained that he  filed the complaint as a concerned citizen and attorney because I was alarmed that Reince Priebus would communicate with the FBI about a pending investigation of the collusion between Trump campaign officials and senior Russian intelligence officials. Communications by Priebus with the FBI about a pending investigation of this sort severely violates the integrity of the investigation and is a blatant form of corruption. While it isn t really likely that this complaint will bring about any real repercussions for Priebus, it does send a very important message: even if Republicans won t stand up to Trump s administration and hold them accountable, the citizens of the United States will.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,27-Feb-17
" Trump Whines About His Obamacare Replacement, Gives The Most PATHETIC Reason Why It Sucks (VIDEO)","Earlier today, Donald Trump told a group of U.S. governors that his mysterious, frustratingly nonspecific replacement plan for Obamacare (also known as the Affordable Care Act) would give states more flexibility amongst other soaring promises. He also thanked some of the governors in the room for helping him because he obviously knew nothing about health care before he stepped into his role as POTUS   and he probably still doesn t.Trump s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare was a disaster from the start, and we re now seeing protests erupt across the country as millions of Americans stand to lose life-saving affordable health care if Trump gets his way. Many prominent GOPers have also spoken out against completely taking Obamacare away from the American people, but Trump isn t listening.In his speech, Trump addressed the reason why his plan has been so secretive and poorly planned. Stating that health care was  unbelievably complex , he said: We have come up with a solution that s really, really I think very good. It s an unbelievably complex subject. Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated. We have a plan that I think is going to be fantastic. It s going to be released fairly soon. I think it s going to be something special   I think you re going to like what you hear. And of course, he couldn t provide any details as usual. Despite bragging about the Republican Party s major move to repeal and replace a health care law that has given millions of Americans affordable, accessible health care, Trump and the GOP have done nothing but stall and beat around the bush. And yet despite having a concrete solution, Trump dissed Obamacare: As soon as we touch it, if we do the most minute thing, just a tiny little change, what s going to happen? They re going to say it s the Republicans  problem. But we have to do what s right because Obamacare is a failed disaster.

 WATCH: George W. Bush Just Proved He Was A Better President Than Trump Will Ever Be,"If it wasn t clear before that Donald Trump is worse than George W. Bush ever was, it s definitely clear now.During an appearance on the TODAY Show on Monday, Bush was asked to comment on Trump s assault on the free press, and he absolutely destroyed him. I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,  Bush said.  We need an independent media to hold people like me to account. Power can be very addictive and it can be corrosive, and it s important for the media to call to account people who abuse their power. One of those people, Bush pointed out, is Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, who controls the media in his country with an iron fist.In fact, Bush said he tried to persuade Putin to allow a free and independent press in Russia.Apparently, Putin didn t budge.Now Trump is copying his buddy Putin by trying to muzzle the free press in the United States, much to the glee of conservatives who think the media should operate as a propaganda machine for their agenda.Trump has declared the media  fake news  every time he sees a story he doesn t like and has even gone so far as to bar news outlets like CNN and the New York Times from press briefings.And Trump s effort to undermine the free press harms America s mission to spread democracy throughout the world because Trump is making us look like a bunch of hypocrites. It s kind of hard to tell others to have an independent free press when we re not willing to have one ourselves,  Bush said.Bush even believes the American people deserve an investigation into Trump s ties with Russia, which have only deepened and become more of a scandal in recent weeks because Trump s administration is trying to use the CIA, FBI, and top Republicans on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees to bury the reports.Furthermore, Bush took a shot at Trump s anti-Muslim travel ban, which caused worldwide chaos and was blocked by the courts. A bedrock of our freedom is the right to worship freely,  Bush said. During Bush s eight years in office, he strove to defend Islam when bigoted people like Trump attacked it as a religion of terrorism just because a few fanatics wrongly used it to justify their deadly attacks.Here s the video via YouTube.In a way, George W. Bush must be so happy right now. On the one hand, Donald Trump is a complete disaster who is acting like a tyrant. It s definitely hurting American prestige and our reputation. But one the other hand, Bush is no longer considered the worst president in American history. Trump managed to take that title in under a month.Featured image via screenshot",News,27-Feb-17
 COVER UP: Sean Spicer Asked CIA And Top Republicans To Bury Russia Reports For Trump,"There needs to be an independent commission and special prosecutor put on this case now.Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Trump campaign officials were in contact with Russian intelligence during the election. Intelligence officials intercepted several communications between Trump s associates and Russian intelligence even as Trump was busy publicly urging Russian hackers to find Hillary Clinton s emails.Infuriated by the report, Trump s chief-of-staff Reince Priebus got caught trying to get the FBI to shut it down. Now White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer just got caught enlisting the CIA Director and top Republicans on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees to bury the reports.According to Axios,  Spicer personally picked up the phone and connected outside officials with reporters to try to discredit a New York Times article about Trump campaign aides  contact with Russia, then remained on the line for the brief conversations. The officials reached by Spicer were CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Senate Select Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr (R-N.C), according to a senior administration official. The reporters were from The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, the official said. Spicer provided reporters  phone numbers to House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who offered to make the calls himself, according to the official:  He was in and out of an event. Pompeo and Burr told the journalists that the Times story wasn t true but provided no details, frustrating the competing reporters, according to the official:  Both of them said: All I can tell you is the story is not accurate. This looks like a direct effort by Trump s White House to kill a report he doesn t like, which begs the question: Why is Trump so desperate to kill the reports about his ties to Russia?Trump s repeated attempts to do so smacks of a cover-up and he is using his partisan CIA Director and top Republicans to do it, the very Republicans who lead the committees that would be responsible for investigating Trump and his Russia ties.Now it s clear that Republicans in Congress can t be trusted to run such an investigation, and former CIA and Pentagon official George Little agrees. It s doubtful that Congress can conduct an objective and independent investigation into ties between this White House and the Russian government if it is collaborating so closely on media pushback with the White House press secretary,  he said.And that means an independent commission needs to be tasked with investigating Trump s ties to Russia and a special prosecutor should be appointed to oversee it.Because it is clear that Trump and his team are trying to hide something. There is something they don t want the American people discovering. We deserve to know the truth and by trying so hard to kill it, Trump is making this story even bigger and more important than ever.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,27-Feb-17
 All Six Oscar Nominees For Best Foreign Film SLAM Trump And His Hate In Epic Letter,"The U.S. is headed in a bad direction, as are many other countries with xenophobic, science-denying, far-right-wing nutjobs worming their way into power to tear the world apart. Last night was Oscars night, which means there were foreign films up for awards. There were six nominees in all for Best Foreign Film, and all six are concerned about the direction of the world in general, but the U.S. in specific.To that end, they wrote an absolutely amazing letter condemning the divisions and hatred that Trump and his ilk are normalizing everywhere.The nominees were Martin Zandvliet (Denmark), for Land of Mine; Hannes Holm (Sweden), for A Man Called Ove; Asghar Farhadi (Iran), for The Salesman; Maren Ade (Germany), for Toni Erdmann; and Martin Butler (Australia), for Bentley Dean-Tanna. They began their letter with: On behalf of all nominees, we would like to express our unanimous and emphatic disapproval of the climate of fanaticism and nationalism we see today in the U.S. and in so many other countries, in parts of the population, and, most unfortunately of all, among leading politicians. They re talking about politicians such as He who Lives in the White House right now, pretending he s a world leader, and all his supporters in Congress and throughout the nation. These six filmmakers see where the far right is trying to divide the world into genders, colors, religions and sexualities, orientations and identities and use those divisions to further their campaigns of fear, and yes, violence and hate.They ask what it is that  cinema can do  here, and they believe the answer is that cinema can provide insight into how different people live and what their lived experiences are. Then they say: We believe there is no best country, best gender, best religion or best color. We want this [Oscar] to stand as a symbol of the unity between nations and the freedom of the arts. While they do say they re concerned about this fanaticism around the world, they really do seem to be speaking to the U.S. because we ve accelerated all of this with our acceptance and election of President Asterisk. So the end of their letter is a sword pointed straight at him and his policies: We dedicate this [Oscar] to all the people, artists journalists and activists who are working to foster unity and understanding, and who uphold freedom of expression and human dignity   values whose protection is now more important than ever. By dedicating the Oscar to them, we wish to express to them our deep respect and solidarity. The right loves saying that awards shows shouldn t be political, and that celebrities need to stick to what they know and stay out of politics. Oh, please. Trump is a threat to the world and to worldwide freedom. Is it really any wonder that foreign artists like these six, especially Farhadi, who hails from one of the countries Trump has tried to ban from the U.S. (and who boycotted the Oscars because of that), would make a point of singling out the U.S. and Donald Trump this way? It s not.And things like this need to be spread far and wide.

 Trump PANICKING As Father Of Slain SEAL Demands Investigation Into His Botched Yemen Raid,"Donald Trump s botched Yemen raid left 30 civilians   including an 8-year-old American girl and other women and children   dead, as well as a Navy SEAL. Trump has been largely silent about the death of William  Ryan  Owens, and with good reason: it was his negligence that caused it.An 11-year-old child was the first to be struck by a bullet after he heard a commotion outside. Many more children as young as three months old would lose their lives in the bloodbath that was Trump s first military operation. Trump, in his haste to approve the operation over dinner without adequate  intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations  according to military officials, failed to kill his primary target. All that we have to show from the botched mission are a few training videos the Trump administration touted as evidence of their success. The videos have been available on YouTube for a decade.The mission was so poorly-executed that Yemen withdrew permission for the United States to conduct anti-terrorism ground operations within its borders   because Trump can not be trusted.And for what was effectively an attempt for The Donald to boost his fragile ego, Owens lost his life.Since the failed mission, the Trump administration has been using the slain SEAL to silence detractors, indicating that any opposition to the failed operation was somehow an assault on Owens himself   and his father has spoken out to tell Trump where he can stick that line of rhetoric. Don t hide behind my son s death to prevent an investigation. I want an investigation.   The government owes my son an investigation. The elder Owens says that when he heard Trump was coming to  pay respects  to his son   a clear attempt to politicize the death his terrible decision making caused   he was not pleased. The Miami Herald reports: I told them I didn t want to make a scene about it, but my conscience wouldn t let me talk to him,  Owens said Friday, speaking out for the first time in an interview with the Miami Herald.Owens, also a military veteran, was troubled by Trump s harsh treatment of a Gold Star family during his presidential campaign. Now Owens was a Gold Star parent, and he said he had deep reservations about the way the decision was made to launch what would be his son s last mission.Ryan and as many as 29 civilians were killed Jan. 28 in the anti-terrorism mission in Yemen. What was intended as a lightning raid to grab cellphones, laptops and other information about terrorists turned into a nearly hour-long firefight in which  everything went wrong,  according to U.S. military officials who spoke to the New York Times.Bill Owens said he was assured that his son, who was shot, was killed early in the fight. It was the first military counter-terrorist operation approved by the new president, who signed the go-ahead Jan. 26   six days into his term. Why at this time did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasn t even barely a week into his administration? Why? For two years prior, there were no boots on the ground in Yemen   everything was missiles and drones   because there was not a target worth one American life. Now, all of a sudden we had to make this grand display? I d like some answers about all the things that happened in the timeline that led up to it. I know what the timeline is, and it bothers me a lot,  Owens says. One aspect in particular is that Donald Trump signed his Muslim ban the day before the raid. As Yemen was one of the affected countries, he wonders if it may have affected friendly forces who were assisting with the raid: It just doesn t make any sense to do something to antagonize an ally when you re going to conduct a mission in that country. Did we alienate some of the people working with them, translators or support people. Maybe they decided to release information to jeopardize the mission. Owens says he has no political agenda; he just wants the truth   as do the rest of us.Featured image via screengrab",News,26-Feb-17
 Trump Once Again Demonstrates Why His Russia Scandal Should Be Investigated,"There is definitely such a thing as protesting too much, and Donald Trump is making it very clear that Congress should investigate his ties to Russia.In yet another hissy fit on Twitter, Trump whined about his Russia scandal continuing to be a major news story and claimed that the media keeps bringing it up to hide his  big  election victory.Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 26, 2017First of all, Trump s  big  election victory was one of the smallest on record. He only received 306 electoral votes, which is lower the both of President Obama s totals in 2008 and 2012. Furthermore, Trump lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.Second, the media continues to report on Russia because it is a major scandal that Trump has been trying to shake for months now. His chief-of-staff Reince Priebus even desperately asked the FBI to shut down the reports on it in order to muzzle the story.Third, leaks are important sources for the press, especially since Trump lies constantly every time he speaks. Also, Trump is only calling the news  fake  because he doesn t like it.But Trump s obsession with calling his Russia scandal  fake news  should be reason enough for Congress to open an investigation. Trump has been protesting this story and trying to make it go away for way too long. If there is truly nothing to the story then Trump would just ignore it. But he isn t because he has something to hide.As usual, Twitter users were not impressed by Trump s tweet either.@realDonaldTrump And can you explain HOW Russia is  fake news ? You ve said this 1000 times yet have never countered a single point!  William LeGate (@williamlegate) February 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump The only  illegal leaks  now are coming from within *your* administration, and we all know leaks cannot be  fake  William LeGate (@williamlegate) February 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump In a recent press conference you were corrected that you did not have the biggest electoral college win.  Al Letson (@Al_Letson) February 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump Additionally, you lost the popular vote by 2.8 million voters. How is this a big election defeat?  Al Letson (@Al_Letson) February 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump was birtherism a fake story? You wanted Obama to prove your accusation wrong. Should you not do the same?  Al Letson (@Al_Letson) February 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump Are you sure it isn t that your talk about inauguration numbers is just a cover for your ties to Russia?  Jules Suzdaltsev (@jules_su) February 26, 2017.@realDonaldTrump How is it fake news AND illegal leaks? If it s fake news, you wouldn t be after leakers.  Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) February 26, 2017The bottom line is that Trump needs to be investigated by Congress, but Republicans are too busy making excuses so that they don t have to do it. Because if they did their duty, they would discover Trump s treachery and would be forced to impeach him. And they don t want to do that because they would lose their rubber stamp and piss off their voter base.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,26-Feb-17
 REPORT: Sean Spicer Forces Staffers To Surrender Phones In Search Of Leakers,"Donald Trump s paranoia and desperation to keep the American people in the dark just took an unconstitutional turn.For weeks, various news outlets have obtained inside information from White House sources such as memos and descriptions of what is going on behind the scenes. That s how we know about what executive orders Trump is considering and how we know about the chaos and infighting that has been plaguing Trump s administration. It s also how we know more about Trump s Russia scandal.Rather than address his executive orders or the chaos in the White House or his Russia scandal, Trump would rather whine about the leaks instead.The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2017Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by  intelligence  like candy. Very un-American!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017You know what is really un-American? Forcing your staffers to hand over their phones for an inspection.According to a report by Politico, White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer actually confiscated the phones of his staff to go through them in order to make sure they are not leaking any information to the press.Of course, if someone had refused to hand over their phone they would have more than likely lost their job so they definitely didn t volunteer to give their phones up. They had to do it out of fear.The staffers were called to an  emergency meeting  and told to place any electronic device they had on them on a table, including personal cell phones, so they could be searched.But the Constitution specifically bars such illegal searches and seizures.The Fourth Amendment states, The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. In other words, if Trump really thinks the leaks are  illegal,  he should have to get a warrant to search the phones of his employees. But he didn t, which means his search is illegal and in violation of the constitutional rights of his staffers. Trump and Spicer can hardly call the confiscation voluntary either since many of these staffers probably believed they would be fired if they did not hand over their phones. That means they were forced to do so, and they can file a lawsuit for having their privacy violated.Once again, Donald Trump and his team are violating the Constitution. Republicans in Congress cannot continue to allow Trump to trample our constitutional rights. It s time to investigate and impeach him. Because at this rate, he ll literally be ripping up the Constitution if he isn t stopped.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,26-Feb-17
 Republican ABSURDLY Claims Investigating Trump Would Be Like ‘McCarthyism’,"Republicans are literally using every excuse they can come up with to avoid investigating Donald Trump.After years of frivolously investigating Hillary Clinton and President Obama, Republicans are refusing to investigate Trump over his various ties to Russia, which includes Russia interfering in our election process on his behalf and Michael Flynn illegally negotiating with Russian officials about the sanctions put in place by President Obama and lying to Mike Pence about it.Republicans have claimed that investigating Trump would be a waste of time and money, conveniently ignoring the fact that they wasted millions and spent years investigating Benghazi, an investigation that surpassed the 9/11 and Watergate investigations as the longest in American history. And that effort turned up nothing.However, Republicans know that if they investigate Trump they will end up actually finding evidence that would warrant immediate impeachment, and they don t want to lose their rubber stamp in the White House and piss off conservative voters in the process.House Intelligence Chairman GOP Rep. Devin Nunes is even going so far as to claim that such an investigation would be a witch hunt similar to McCarthyism. This is almost like McCarthyism revisited,  Nunes said at a Republican convention in California.  We re going to go on a witch hunt against, against innocent Americans. You read that right. Nunes actually just claimed that Trump and his accomplices are totally innocent even though the evidence is stacking up.According to Nunes, the intelligence community has no evidence of Trump and his administration doing anything suspicious. At this point there s nothing there,  Nunes continued.  Once we begin to look at all the evidence, and if we find any American that had any contact with Russian agents or anybody affiliated with the Russian government, then we ll be glad to, at that point, you know, subpoena those people before the House and let the legislative branch do its oversight and then we would recommend it over to, you know, the appropriate people. Of course, that s complete bullshit. Not only did the intelligence community agree that Russia interfered with the election, Michael Flynn was forced to resign for being in contact with Russian officials prior to Trump taking office. Also, Trump and his team are trying really hard to kill any talk of an investigation, even desperately asking the FBI to shut it down.Trump s business has ties to Russian oligarchs who are close to Vladimir Putin. Trump s taxes would probably show his ties to Russia but he refuses to release them because they would incriminate him.Russia has literally been a scandal for Trump since before Election Day and it has only continued to get bigger since he took office last month.But Nunes is ignoring all of that, claiming that an investigation against Trump would be  against the American people.  He also subscribed to Trump s claim that the media is  fake news. At this point, we can t go on a witch hunt against the American people, any American people who have not had any contact just because they appeared in a news story,  Nunes concluded.Again, this is outrageously absurd. The only reason Republicans don t want to investigate Trump is because they don t want to investigate one of their own. If Trump were a Democrat, Republicans would have impeached him on day one. It is the duty of Congress to investigate Trump s Russia scandal. That s not McCarthyism because Joe McCarthy accused hundreds of people of being communists without any proof whatsoever. There is a lot of proof that Trump is in bed with the Russians. But Republicans are hypocrites and that s why they should all be thrown out of office in 2018 so that Democrats can take over Congress and impeach Trump and his entire administration.Featued image via Andrew Harrer   Pool/Getty Images",News,26-Feb-17
" WATCH: Fox Host Chris Wallace SMACKS Trump, Asks How Attacking The Media Creates Jobs","When one of Donald Trump s minions appeared on Fox News Sunday to sell bullshit, Chris Wallace was not buying it.For months, Trump has been launching vicious attacks on the media, even going so far as to call them the  enemy of the American people  and ban several news organizations from White House press briefings.Trump says outlets like the New York Times and CNN are reporting on him inaccurately despite having no proof to support his claims.Also, whining about things seems to be all Trump is capable of doing as he has also attacked the intelligence community, congressmen, businesses, Saturday Night Live, and anyone else who criticizes him.So when Corey Lewandowski appeared on Fox on Sunday, Chris Wallace put the screws to him. The reason we invited you on in the first place, I want to talk about the Trump agenda with you,  Wallace began before playing video of Steve Bannon accusing the media of standing in the way of Trump s  economic nationalist  agenda. These last couple of weeks of Mr. Trump s first days in office have been dominated by attacks on the media and the intelligence community,  Wallace continued.  Do all of these attacks on the media and intelligence and opponents, does that get in the way of that message? Lewandowski responded by attacking the media, accusing the media of writing  100 percent factually inaccurate  reports. Lewandowski then repeated Trump s demand that the media report what he tells them to report instead of investigating and digging for the truth. Why not just pursue his agenda?  Wallace shot back.  He may be right on that or he may be wrong. But how many jobs does that create? Indeed, attacking the media and the various people and entities that criticize him have not created any jobs for Americans. In fact, Trump is too busy focusing on his obsession with the media than he is on working on behalf of the American people. And that is causing him to lag in comparison to his predecessors, something Wallace was quick to inform Lewandowski about after he tried to claim that the media is forcing Trump to attack them. He s falling behind where other new presidents have been at the same point in their term,  Wallace said.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump needs to seriously sort out his priorities and get his lazy ass back to work instead of using his time to whine. It s unpresidential and will only give the media more to criticize him about.Trump made a promise to create jobs in this country but he is apparently too busy worrying about what the media is saying about him to care about keeping it.Featured image via screeenshot",News,26-Feb-17
 John Kasich: Completely Getting Rid Of Obamacare Is Just ‘Not Acceptable’ (VIDEO),"Ohio Governor and former Republican presidential hopeful John Kasich says that the GOP s plan for a full repeal of Obamacare, which would leave millions without health insurance, is just  not acceptable. Appearing Sunday morning on CBS s Face The Nation, Kasich discussed Congressional Republican s determination to repeal the Affordable Care Act even though they don t have a replacement plan. The Ohio Governor told host John Dickerson that Republicans are going to have to reach across party lines and work with Democrats if they hope to come up with a plan that will keep Americans from dying due to lack of health care. I mean there s going to be a problem in the House of getting anything out of there that still provides coverage to people,  Kasich noted.  That s why the Republicans have to reach out to some of the Democrats. I don t know whether that s going to happen. Dickerson pressed him, asking him to provide a deeper explanation. Well because I think there are some very conservative Republicans in the House who are going to say just get rid of the whole thing,  he stated.  And that s not acceptable when you have 20 million people, or 700,000 people in my state, because where do the mentally ill go? Where do the drug addicted go? As a resident of Ohio myself, I m not exactly sure when Kasich became the voice of reason. If my memory serves, it was sometime during the primaries when he showed that he was the only Republican still in the running who wasn t batshit crazy. But I digress.Kasich is right. Leaving millions of Americans without health insurance is simply  not acceptable  by any stretch of the imagination.Watch Kasich s interview, here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,26-Feb-17
 WATCH: CNN Panelist HUMILIATES ‘Snowflake’ Trump For Cowardly Backing Out Of Correspondent’s Dinner,"Donald Trump is so thin-skinned that he would rather sit in the White House and pout instead of attending the White House Correspondent s Dinner.It is a tradition for the president to attend the annual White House Correspondent s Dinner. It s a chance to spend time with reporters and journalists and enjoy the entertainment of a comedian. Stephen Colbert, Craig Ferguson, Jon Stewart, and Jay Leno are just a few of the big-name comedians who have headlined the event. And presidents get the opportunity to let off some steam by delivering jokes. President Obama was particularly skilled at self-deprecating humor while also making jokes about his critics.For example, President Obama once seriously burned Donald Trump with a joke in 2011 in reference to Trump s birtherism. Now, I know that he s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,  Obama said.  And that s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter   like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac? President Obama then joked about Trump s  leadership  on Celebrity Apprentice for firing Gary Busey after a cooking contest.  These are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night. Well handled, sir. Well handled,  Obama said. Meanwhile, Obama had just ordered the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, which makes his appearance at the Dinner even more impressive.But Trump has decided to be a big baby and is now the first president to ever skip the event. Ronald Reagan did not attend in 1981, but he had a good excuse since he had just been shot. But he still managed to deliver some remarks via phone.I will not be attending the White House Correspondents  Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017During a discussion on CNN on Saturday, New York Times TV critic Bill Carter took Trump to the woodshed for cowardly refusing to attend. Republicans always criticize the media,  Carter said.  This has reached a point where it s over the top, actually. Any story that s critical of him now becomes  fake. Indeed, Trump has declared war on the media because they refuse to be his cheerleading squad. And I think the fact that he s bowing out of this dinner, it has a little bit of the quality of  You can t fire me, I quit.  because a lot of people are dropping out of this dinner,  Carter continued.And it s true. Trump s attacks on the media have caused many news outlets to cancel parties and refuse to go to the dinner. Now that Trump isn t going, perhaps these outlets will now reverse their decision.But Carter wasn t done yet. Carter said that Trump knows he isn t going to get a good reception from the crowd at this event, particularly in light of his claim that the media is the  enemy of the American people. In other words, Trump is literally running away because he doesn t want to be criticized. He likes to have paid applauders,  he quipped.  The whole thing would have been fraught for him. And I know there s been a lot of criticism of Democrats for being  snowflakes,  but it s sort of snowflake-y to me, to back out of this. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump knows that he won t be a very welcome guest at the dinner event, but that doesn t mean he should tuck his tail between his legs and run away. If ever there was a chance for a mea culpa with the media, this is it. Trump could apologize to the media for his unfair and un-American attacks on them and try to build a better relationship with them. But he won t because he is a petulant child who would rather throw a temper tantrum instead of doing something that makes him look like a grown-up.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,26-Feb-17
" Trump Attacks The ‘Failing’ New York Times, But The Internet Sets Him Straight About Who’s ‘Failing’ (TWEETS)","Donald Trump kicked off his Sunday morning by once again attacking the New York Times, one of the many  fake news  organizations he has apparently banned from his press briefings along with CNN, Politico, the LA Times, and Buzzfeed   all organizations he called  the enemy of the American people  in a hastily deleted (yet widely noticed) tweet   while allowing Breitbart and others to attend.Commenting on an ad the New York Times is running   one with a message that the truth is important   The Donald said that the  bad  ad is an effort to  save its failing reputation,  apparently missing the point that the Times (winner of 119 Pulitzer Prizes) is neither failing nor does it need advertising to  save  itself no matter what he throws at the news organization.For first time the failing @nytimes will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation.

Conservative, liberal or otherwise,  he said during an interview while explaining away Trump banning media from events,  that s what makes a democracy a democracy versus a dictatorship. I think there is a vastly different model when it comes to government and what should be expected, and that s on both sides. I think we have a respect for the press when it comes to the government. That is something you can t ban an entity from,  Spicer said. But now the Trump administration is banning media from government functions. . Senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller made it clear that Trump s actions are absolute and  will not be questioned  after judges killed The Donald s Muslim ban. That paints a pretty clear picture of how the Trump administration views themselves   as dictators.It is up to the American people to stop them.Featured image via Getty Images(Mario Tama)/screengrab",News,26-Feb-17
 Trump Goes On DELUSIONAL Tweet Storm About Democratic Party Chair Election (DETAILS),"Donald Trump has no reason to give a shit about what is happening with the Democratic Party right now. He got elected president as a Republican, and right now the Democrats are trying to rebuild and elect new leaders. Of course, we all know that Tom Perez got elected Chair, and immediately named Keith Ellison his Deputy Chair in a clear effort to unite the two wings of the party.There s no reason for a GOP president who also has the benefit of controlling much of the nation s governorships and state legislatures, as well as the federal government, to address this. However, it s Trump, so of course he had something to say. In a classic early morning set of tweets, Trump used the DNC elections to talk about a  rigged  2016 electoral process:Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017The race for DNC Chairman was, of course, totally ""rigged."" Bernie's guy, like Bernie himself, never had a chance. Clinton demanded Perez!  Donald J.

As a Democrat, it is hard for me to admit this, but we are in a very weak position right now. So, the GOP really shouldn t give a shit about what is going on in our party. However, Trump is a narcissist, so he MUST make himself become the story, no matter what the story is. This guy is a nut, so it s useless trying to make his words or actions make sense.At the end of the day, this is REALLY about his continuing inability to admit that he legitimately lost the popular vote by numbers never before seen in modern presidential history, while winning the Electoral College and thus the White House.This guy is a delusional nutcase, and must be removed post haste, for the safety of the republic.Featured image via Tama/Getty Images",News,26-Feb-17
 Muhammad Ali’s Son Detained At Airport Because His Name Sounds Too Muslim,"Immigration officials in Florida proved how out of control things are in Trump s America by detaining the son of Muhammad Ali because his name happens to sound too Muslim for their liking.Muhammad Ali Jr. and his mother, Khalilah Camacho-Ali, were on their way home after speaking at a Black History Month event in Montego Bay, Jamaica. On Feb. 7, they flew into Fort Lauderdale, Florida. And then things took a disturbing turn.Chris Mancini, a lawyer and friend of the family says they were pulled to the side as they were going through customs. Khalilah Camacho-Ali was released when she pulled out a photo of her with the legendary boxer, but Muhammad Ali Jr. didn t have such a photo. Apparently, being related to a famous person would have meant more to officials than the fact that he s an American citizen with a U.S. passport to prove it.Ali Jr. was held by immigration officials and questioned for almost two hours. Where did you get your name from?  they asked him over and over. When they asked him if he was a Muslim, he said yes, and that really set off alarm bells for officials. They continued to question him about his religion and repeatedly asked him where he was born. Just for the record, he was born in Philadelphia in 1971.USA Today reports:While Ali Jr. was detained, Camacho-Ali ran around the airport asking,  Where s my son?  and begging for help, according to Mancini. Because incidents involving customs officials are considered to be on federal soil, local police had no jurisdiction to help her. Ali Jr. was eventually released two hours later, and the family contacted Mancini the following day.They have both traveled all over the world and never, ever, have they been subjected to this kind of treatment, said Mancini.  To the Ali family, it s crystal clear that this is directly linked to Mr. Trump s efforts to ban Muslims from the United States,  he added. Imagine walking into an airport and being asked about your religion,  he said.  This is classic customs profiling. According to Mancini, the Ali family is debating whether or not to file a federal lawsuit and are searching for others who have been subjected to this kind of racial profiling and harassment.Featured image via Andrew H.

 Trump Just Threw The WORST Insult YET Out To The White House Press Corps,"Donald Trump hates the press, unless the press is the far-right wing rags that kiss his ass nonstop, and report only what he likes. On Friday, Sean Spicer held a press gaggle in his office and included some of those rags, while excluding established media outlets with long histories in the White House. The AP and TIME Magazine boycotted the gaggle in solidarity with The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, CNN and Politico.CNN and The New York Times hit back pretty hard, and the White House Correspondents  Association likewise hit back. Now, with the White House Correspondents  dinner coming up in a couple of months, Trump is yet again insulting the press. He just announced on Twitter he s not going to attend the dinner this year.I will not be attending the White House Correspondents  Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017The president generally attends the dinner and gets up onstage to poke fun at himself and everyone in existence, and it s generally hilarious. Trump, however, is at war with the press as evidenced not just by Spicer s treatment of certain media outlets, but also by his own speech at CPAC, where he railed against the  fake news  media.He does it all the time on Twitter, too, and some press outlets are getting tired of it.As far as the dinner, CNN and MSNBC have indicated that they might not attend this year. Vanity Fair and The New Yorker have both announced they won t be there. A list of attendees hasn t been published yet, but we can probably expect more outlets to refuse to attend even if Trump isn t going to be there.Featured image by Olivier Douliery via Getty Images",News,25-Feb-17
 France Just Put Trump Fans Who Hate Obama TO SHAME With This Incredible Movement,"While Trump and his loyal subjects keep bleating about the mess Obama left for them to clean up, and insist that the world laughed at us for the entire eight years of his administration, a growing movement in France is proving them to be completely out of their gourds. France s presidential election is coming up in April, and these people, fed up with Marine Le Pen and her Trump-like attitudes and policies, want Obama to come be France s president.Seriously. They ve got a petition going that s asking Obama to run, and they re hoping they can get at least one million signatures on it. They ve also put up 500 posters around Paris and have an actual campaign organization going:Oui on peut   (?) #obama2017 #streetsofparis pic.twitter.com/v6ptl9DSJB  Romuald COUSTRE (@rcoustre) February 21, 2017Does Obama want to be president of France? Probably not, and the truth is that this is a bit of a joke. But it s not a joke on Obama or the U.S. It s a  joke  in that this group knows he s not going to come run for president there, and they re using this campaign to send a very serious message: We are so fed up with what Marine Le Pen is doing, and with the fact that we weren t able to find a candidate to vote for, only one to vote against. We started talking about that and it came up that Obama is free   so why not hire him? In other words, they see Obama as someone who still represents hope and something to fight for in a world where we increasingly just vote and fight against things.People have actually been getting in touch with the campaign to offer ideas for how to get around the fact that Obama isn t French. Even some lawyers have contacted them with advice on how to make it possible, like making him a naturalized citizen of France. But nobody knows if Obama is even aware of this yet. If he is, and he answers, then the campaign believes there will be a huge reaction.Featured image by Scott Olson via Getty Images",News,25-Feb-17
 Trump’s National Security Adviser Thinks Obama Was Right About Terrorism All Along,"Donald Trump s new national security adviser thinks former-President Obama was right all along, at least when it comes to his stance on terrorism.HR McMaster, the respected army lieutenant general Trump chose to replace Michael Flynn after he resigned, told White House staff at a meeting on Thursday that he does not want to use the term radical Islamic terrorism.  You know, what Obama has been saying for years.The Guardian reports: A participant, paraphrasing McMaster, said:  He said he doesn t want to call it radical Islamic terrorism because the terrorists are, quote,  un-Islamic . McMaster, the participant said, indicated that the phrase castigates  an entire religion  and  he s not on board .At the meeting, multiple sources said, McMaster discomfited White House staffers who view the terrorist threat in those religious terms and who were said to have exchanged awkward looks with each other.Participants who attended the meeting said they were shocked by how different McMaster s views are from those of Trump, who has dropped the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism  at any chance he got.During the meeting, McMaster also let it be known that he disagrees with Trump on several other points as well. He reportedly  laid out a vigorous defense of the post-second world war liberal order, calling it a guarantor of peace and economic prosperity.  Trump, on the other hand, has attacked these same longstanding foreign-policy goals repeatedly.McMaster also took a stance on Russia that is the polar opposite of his Putin loving boss.  One source said McMaster was  very clear  that he viewed Russia  as an adversary,'  the Guardian reports.Trump chose McMaster as his new national security adviser after Flynn was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had told the Russian ambassador not to worry about sanctions during a phone call that took place before Trump was sworn in.Thanks to Trump s Islamophobic policies, at least one prominent NSC staffer has already resigned. Rumana Ahmed, who worked on strategic communications, stepped down after Trump issued his Muslim ban. She said his  radical Islamic terrorism  rhetoric is really no different from the rhetoric of ISIS.Many who attended the meeting were relieved that McMasters doesn t seem to be a complete crazy person when it comes to foreign policy, but they have no idea how that will  work in context with the rest of the White House .Featured image via video screen capture",News,25-Feb-17
 Neo-Nazi Leader Calls Depeche Mode ‘Official Band Of Alt-Right’; The Band Has Other Ideas,"Richard Spencer, the Trump supporting leader of the white nationalist alt-right movement is a fan of the 80s and 90s alternative rock band Depeche Mode, so much so that he said that the band, who sings about racial equality, is the  official band of the alt-right.  Um, no, they aren t and Depeche Mode was quick to let them know.When asked if he likes rock music, according to New York magazine s Olivia Nuzzi, Spencer joked,  Depeche Mode is the official band of the Alt-Right.  Though the  lifelong Depeche Mode fan  later told Rolling Stone,  My tongue was firmly in cheek,  the 38-year-old speaker-provocateur expounded on his love of the group, prompting a quick rebuttal from the left-leaning band. They aren t a typical rock band, in terms of lyrics and much else,  he tells Rolling Stone.  Depeche Mode is a band of existential angst, pain, sadism, horror, darkness and much more. It s not bubblegum pop, with frontmen who sing about  luuuuv  and sugarplum faries [sic]. There was a certain Communist aesthetic to an early album like [1982 s] A Broken Frame as well as titles like Music for the Masses but then there s a bit of a fascist element, too. It s obviously ambiguous, and as with all art, everything is multi-layer, contradictory and ambivalent.Source: Rolling StoneThis is all pretty funny since Dave Gahan, Depeche Mode s frontman, called Trump a  nazi  during the presidential campaign, and sorry Richard, it wasn t a compliment, although perhaps that s how Spencer took it:When asked about Trump, Gahan told Italian journalist Matteo Cruccu of Corriere della Sera in a video interview:  The things that he s saying sound very similar to what someone was saying in 1935. That didn t work out very well! The things that he s saying are cruel and heartless and promoting fear. Source: Heat StreetNot surprisingly, Depeche Mode responded to Spencer with a firm and unambiguous  Depeche Mode has no ties to Richard Spencer of the Alt-Right and does not support the Alt-Right movement.This is a statement the band made during the 80s about race relations.

" ‘Need A Safe Place, Pumpkin?’: The Internet Drags Trump For Begging Supporters To Throw A Rally","Amateur president Donald Trump has avoided doing any real work while only being on the job for just over one month. The 70-year-old has taken several vacations, though, and his trips to his extravagant resort Mar-a-Lago have cost the taxpayers dearly. Just after  winning  the election, Trump went on a thank you tour. Later, after taking the oath of office, the thin-skinned alleged president held a rally in Florida. Trump needs his ego fed daily. With abysmally low approval ratings and finding himself plagued with scandals, Trump wants his supporters to throw a rally in his honor.

 Fox’s Shep Smith Has Yet Another EPIC Anti-Trump Rant; Schools Him On ‘Fake News’ (VIDEO),"As Donald Trump has turned his presidency into an all out war against the mainstream media, the media is finding heroes in strange places   namely Fox News, without whose propaganda we likely would never had had even a candidate Trump let alone the new occupant of the White House.Last week, after Trump s disastrous press conference in which he attacked the media, and especially CNN, Fox s Shep Smith had an eight minute rant defending the media and calling out Trump for his lies. Listen to it if you haven t already. It s amazing.A week has passed and Trump hasn t let up on the media. On Friday, he went so far as to call the media the  enemy of the people,  and he vowed to do something about it.  That s beyond dangerous. It s dictator 101.Oh, but it got worse on Friday a lot worse. The White House, in an unprecedented move, banned several news outlets from the briefing room.Shortly after Mr Trump s speech on Friday, a number of selected media organisations were invited into Mr Spicer s office for an informal briefing, or  gaggle .Those allowed into the room included ABC, Fox News, Breitbart News, Reuters and the Washington Times.When asked why some were excluded, Mr Spicer said it was his decision to  expand the pool  of reporters.He also warned the White House was going to  aggressively push back  at  false narratives  in the news.Politico, Buzzfeed and the Daily Mail were also left out, but CNN was the only major US television network to be denied entry.Source: BBCSmith is not happy. He once again called out Trump and this time, told him exactly what  fake news  means.For the report,  fake news  refers to stories that are created by entities pretended to be news organizations and based on nothing of substance. Fake news is made up nonsense delivered for financial gain. CNN s reporting was not fake news. Its journalistics followed the same standards that other organizations, including Fox News, adhere. Senior administration officials regularly speak without attribution so that the public needs to be informed of what our government is doing off the record.Source: MediaiteHere s the video: Even other Fox personalities were upset with the ban:Some at CNN & NYT stood w/FOX News when the Obama admin attacked us & tried 2 exclude us-a WH gaggle should be open to all credentialed orgs https://t.co/8Vjcs0KCPR  Bret Baier (@BretBaier) February 24, 2017IF true that @SeanSpicer & #WH are banning certain disfavored news organizations All must refuse to play along.

In just over 30 days, Trump has demonstrated that he s hiding a lot, beginning with his tax returns and his relationship with Russia.

" CNN Just Went After Trump For Banning Them, And It Was Pretty Damn Awesome (VIDEO)","Donald Trump and his team are desperate to cover up and stop the reporting of the FBI s investigations into Trump s Russia ties, and they just made a major mistake while trying to control the media.Earlier today during the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Trump railed against the media in a bizarre rant. Just hours after Trump spoke, the White House decided to take this hostility one step further and banned certain media outlets that Trump had taken issue with from a press gaggle. There were several others such as The New York Times and BuzzFeed, but the most predictable network that was shunned was none other than CNN, who Trump has often referred to as  fake news. In response, CNN put out a public statement calling the Trump administration s behavior  unacceptable. And the network wasn t done. CNN s Jake Tapper weighed in on the White House s actions and tore into Trump. He said: This White House doesn t value an independent press. There s a word for that line of thinking: The word is un-American. You can watch Tapper s brilliant takedown of Trump below:Tapper couldn t have been more correct, and he s perfectly demonstrating how the media should be responding to Trump. Tapper didn t attempt to sugarcoat anything and brilliantly called Trump out for trying to run America like a dictatorship.Trump and his team have done everything they can to distract from their wrongdoings, and it s all coming to a head now. They are trying to discredit the country s free press and create distrust with American citizens so that Trump and his minions can continue to get away with their scandals. Americans need to stand by the media and continue to pay attention whenever Trump tried to pull a disgusting stunt like this one. It s really our only chance against such a dishonest administration.Featured image via screenshot and Pool / Getty Images",News,24-Feb-17
 WATCH: Sean Spicer In December STRONGLY Opposed Exactly What He Did Today,"In a shocking move, White House press secretary Sean Spicer banned major news organizations such The New York Times, CNN, BBC, LA Times, Politico and BuzzFeed from attending a press briefing.

This move by the Trump administration is likely in retaliation to the damning report published yesterday stating that the FBI refused the White House s request to publicly knock down media reports regarding communications between Donald Trump s associates and Russians known to U.S. intelligence during the 2016 presidential campaign.Even weirder, Spicer had that conversation with a reporter from Politico, an established media source he has now just banned.

 White House Takes Its War On The Press To A TERRIFYING New Level (VIDEO),"Donald Trump and his team are no fans of the free press. They call any story that they dislike  fake news,  and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon has called the press the  opposition party.  Perhaps most disturbing of all is Trump himself calling the press an  enemy of the American people.  Well, it seems that the Trump White House s disdain for the free press has now been taken to a new and horrifying level.During Press Secretary Sean Spicer s daily press briefing, mainstream outlets were barred from the room in favor of Trump-friendly outlets such as Breitbart and the Washington Times. Further, rather than the traditional televised briefing, this was an informal gathering in Spicer s White House office instead, with no cameras allowed. Banished from the room were major, legitimate outlets such as CNN, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Politico, and Buzzfeed.

 Ruth Bader Ginsburg Makes America A Promise And It Could Help Save Democracy,"Liberals love us some Ruth Bader Ginsberg, who has been carrying the Supreme Court s torch for sanity for about 25 years. She s also 83-years-old, which in this climate of Republican domination and with an administration that doesn t give a damn about the constraints of the Constitution, is a little bit worrisome. In an appearance at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., Ginsburg told the audience that she s got this. She s not going anywhere if she can help it. I will do this job as long as I can do it full steam,  Ginsburg, 83, said at an appearance Thursday night at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.  When I can t, that will be the time I will step down. In an interview on the BBC s  Newsnight  broadcast, Ginsburg noted that Justice John Paul Stevens was 90 when he retired and said:  So I have a way to go. Ginsburg held her tongue on Donald Trump after she was forced to apologize for remarks building up to the election, but she did say,  We are not experiencing the best times,  and noted that our political system is like a pendulum and it always swings back. She did allude to Trump s campaign slogan, though, when she said that  We are not as mindful of what makes America great. Source: NBCHere s the video:Ginsburg is the oldest justice on the court by over three years. Presumably, Donald Trump will fill the court s current vacancy, which occurred when  ber conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died in February of last year. Republicans refused to let President Obama fill the seat, but now that they control both houses of Congress and the Presidency, it s likely that Trump s nominee, Neil Gorsuch, will get through. Even with Ginsburg on the court, that would leave us with a 4 justice minority on a nine justice court.Liberals, for good reason, are feeling very protective toward the diminutive legal powerhouse. I m very interested in this.  says Jeanette Bavwidinski, a community organizer in Pennsylvania.  I m interested in what her daily regimen is. Like, what are you all feeding RBG? Is she getting enough fresh air? Is she walking? Is she staying low-stress? What is she reading? Is she reading low-stress things? Can she eat more kale?  asks Kim Landsbergen, a forest ecologist in Ohio.  Eat more kale, that s all I can say. We love you. Eat more kale. Source: Washington PostThe good news for us is that Ginsburg is taking her health quite seriously, possibly because she s already survived cancer twice. And she was back at work two weeks after surgery. Ginsburg works out. Every morning, she does a routine of planks and push-ups. That s not all. She has performed the Canadian Air Force workout and doesn t shy away from sports like waterskiing and horseback riding. Intellectually, she s still sharp as a tack.We ll certainly need Ginsburg to stick around for at least four more years and at the rate she s going, she probably will.Featured image via Allison Shelly/Getty Images.",News,24-Feb-17

 Bradley Whitford Perfectly Articulates How We’re All Feeling About Trump’s Presidency; It’s AWESOME (VIDEO),"On Thursday night, actor Bradley Whitford, of Transparent and West Wing fame, stopped by the Late Show to speak with Stephen Colbert. It just so happens that Colbert had adorable adoptable puppies there on the set Thursday night as well, and Whitford brought one out with him for his interview.Whitford explained that the puppy, Tucker, was calming him down, and that the little animal was helping him deal with Donald Trump s presidency. Whitford said: I need a service dog, since the election. Colbert reminded Whitford that the actor had already been in full-blown  Trump panic  back in September, and then proceeded to ask him how he is now. Whitford said: This is calming me, but I do want to reiterate that our president was a birther, which is racist and un-American. And we have a white nationalist working in the White House, and they have conflated refugees with terrorism, and now they are picking on transgender people. It s not a joke, and it s very upsetting. Colbert went on to share some of Whitford s large number of political tweets, which are coming these days in a seemingly unending stream. His profile photo also shows him in a pink  pussy hat  from the historic Women s March.I am so happy that this man articulated what so many of us are feeling these days. I d like one of those puppies to get me through the next four years as well.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,24-Feb-17
 Man Screamed ‘Get Out Of My Country’ Before Shooting Two Immigrants In A Bar,"In yet another example of the rash of hate crimes that has accompanied Donald Trump s presidency, a 51-year-old man was arrested Thursday night after opening fire in a crowded bar. His reason? Some folks were a little too  dark  for his taste.Adam Purinton was arrested Thursday just after midnight at an Applebee s in Missouri after he bragged to a bartender that he had shot someone. He mentioned he had been involved in a shooting and we went out there and picked him up,  Assistant Clinton Police Chief Sonny Lynch said, explaining that the restaurant s bartender had contacted law enforcement. Earlier in the night, Purinton was drinking at Austin s Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas. According to a bartender he began using  racial sluts  before drawing his weapon and opening fire on Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasanim, two regulars at the bar who work as engineers at GPS manufacturer Garmin as well as Ian Grillot, a random bar patron who heroically stepped in to help the men. From what I understand when he was throwing racial slurs at the two gentlemen (Kuchibhotla and Madasani), Ian (Grillot) stood up for them,  bartender Garret Bohnen says.  We re all proud of him.  According to other witnesses, Pruinton yelled  get out of my country  before opening fire. Grillot went above and beyond in defending the two victims of this vicious attack. The Independent reports: Grillot said in an interview from his hospital bed that when the shooting broke out, he hid until nine shots had been fired and he thought the suspect s gun magazine was empty. I got up and proceeded to chase him down, try to subdue him,  Grillot said in a video from the University of Kansas Health System posted on the Star website.  I got behind him and he turned around and fired a round at me. Grillot said that the bullet went through his hand and into his chest, just missing a major artery. It s not about where he (victim) was from or his ethnicity,  Grillot said.  We re all humans, so I just did what was right to do. Kuchibhotla died at an area hospital and Madasani and Grillot were taken in for treatment. They are in stable condition   unlike the man who committed this hate crime and his ideological clones. While it seems pretty clear that this is a hate crime, FBI special agent Eric Jackson explains that it s too early to make that determination. This was a violent crime and we want the best prosecution that relates to this because there are victims of this crime and we want the community to know that,  he says.  We re looking to make sure that the individual involved in this is held accountable for his actions. Unfortunately, we can expect to see more and more of this as Trump continues to amp up the anti-immigrant rhetoric. Recently, it was made public that The Donald intends to remove neo-Nazis and other white supremacists from the  Countering Violent Extremism program, which will focus solely on Muslims  not white almost certainly Christian terrorists like Purinton.This is one act of terrorism that Trump will not mention.Featured image via screengrab",News,24-Feb-17
" Trump Told FBI To Kill Stories About His Connections To Putin, They Said No","Quite a bit about the Trump presidency has been unprecedented   the amount of hate crimes in the country, the number of white supremacists in the White House, the level of corruption Speaking of corruption, reports are now surfacing that indicate Trump is extremely worried about the numerous investigations into The Donald and his team s connections to Russia.A White House official revealed Thursday that chief of staff Reince Priebus contacted a top FBI official to dispute reports that members of the administration and Trump s campaign staff were in frequent contact with Russian operatives during the election. WDSU reports:The official said Priebus  request came after the FBI told the White House it believed a New York Times report last week describing those contacts was not accurate. As of Thursday, the FBI had not stated that position publicly and there was no indication it planned to.The New York Times reported that U.S. agencies had intercepted phone calls last year between Russian intelligence officials and members of Trump s 2016 campaign team.Priebus  discussion with FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe sparked outrage among some Democrats, who said he was violating policies intended to limit communications between the law enforcement agency and the White House on pending investigations. The White House is simply not permitted to pressure the FBI to make public statements about a pending investigation of the president and his advisers,  Michigan Representative John Conyers, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said of the news.A 2009 memo from then-AG Eric Holder makes it very clear that the Justice Department is only to advise the White House on ongoing investigations   when it is important for the performance of the president s duties and appropriate from a law enforcement perspective. The FBI has not made a public statement regarding Trump and his team s Russia connections, but Priebus says that the top levels of the intelligence community  have informed him that the allegations are  not only grossly overstated, but also wrong. We didn t try to knock the story down. We asked them to tell the truth,  White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in response to reports   an admission that the Trump administration had violated the decade-old rule against such contacts.It is clear at this point that Trump and his friends are scared.

 Colbert Scorches Trump’s Anti-Trans Bigotry; It’s The Best Thing EVER (VIDEO),"During his campaign, Donald Trump promised that he was a friend of the LGBTQ community. Of course, after watching him stack his campaign and now his cabinet with virulently homophobic and transphobic figures, we all knew that was a steaming pile. Trump proved us all right on Wednesday, when it was revealed that he and his bigoted administration rolled back the protections for transgender school children that were put in place by the Obama Administration.President Obama was, of course, a fierce champion for LGBTQ equality, and he made sure that transgender people would be protected in public spaces. Of course, the bigots in the Trump Administration have no intention of doing anything but pandering to the Religious Right, and therefore will be doing all they can to assault this same community. Well, there s one late night host who has had enough of Trump s bigotry: Late Show host Stephen Colbert.On Thursday night s edition of the show, Colbert employed the use of animated bathroom signs to give Trump and his administration a literal middle finger when it comes to policing genitals and bathrooms. Of course, it will be a cold day in hell before Trump or anyone on his team would watch such a show, but it sure is nice to have people in prominent positions on the side of those who are arguably the most vulnerable people in our society right now: LGBTQ youth.Watch the amazing clip below, via the Late Show Twitter:The brave souls who point the way to our nation s bathrooms are not taking Trump s rollback of transgender rights lightly. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/gBYiBIoPxf  The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) February 24, 2017Featured image via Frederick M.

 Gabby Giffords Shames GOP Rep. For Using Her Shooting As An Excuse To Hide From Town Halls,"Republicans across the country have been doing all they can to avoid town hall meetings where angry constituents are waiting. But Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) should win some type of award for his despicable excuse.Earlier this week, Gohmert claimed that he hadn t scheduled a town hall meeting to discuss important issues with the people he represents because with all the angry protesters around he s afraid of a shooting like the one that involved Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. But don t worry. This isn t because he s a coward. It s just that he wants to keep his constituents safe. Unfortunately, at this time there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology, some even being paid, who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety. Threats are nothing new to me and I have gotten my share as a felony judge. However, the House Sergeant at Arms advised us after former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot at a public appearance, that civilian attendees at Congressional public events stand the most chance of being harmed or killed   just as happened there. In a scathing statement, Giffords slammed Gohmert for his cowardly comments and basically told him to grow a pair. She pointed out that her offices were open after her shooting. Giffords added that the representative who took her place during that difficult time also continued to hold town halls rather than hide from the people. Her statement ended by shaming Gohmert and telling him, point blank, to  have some courage. I was shot on a Saturday morning. By Monday morning my offices were open to the public. Ron Barber   at my side that Saturday, who was shot multiple times, then elected to Congress in my stead   held town halls. It s what the people deserve in a representative. In the past year, campaigning for gun safety, I have held over 50 public events. To the politicians who have abandoned their civic obligations, I say this: Have some courage. Face your constituents. Hold town halls. Giffords followed her statement up with a tweet that shared the same message.To the politicians who have abandoned their civic obligations, I say this: Have some courage. Face your constituents. Hold town halls.  Gabrielle Giffords (@GabbyGiffords) February 23, 2017It is also worth noting that Republicans aren t willing to pass legislation that might help control the massive gun problem clutching the United States.

He s a complete ass, he s hateful, he s a white supremacist, he s overbearing, he s domineering, and he leads by fear instead of example. During CPAC, Bannon and Trump s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, were up on stage for a joint interview when Bannon appeared to grab Priebus  arm.What Priebus did, for all to see, should humiliate Bannon beyond reason. He literally slapped Bannon off of him, while turning to look at the interviewer to whom they were speaking. Watch it below:WEIRD! Anyone Catch Bannon Grabbing Priebus and then his reaction? pic.twitter.com/YVE22Mg8TO  Impeach Donald Trump (@Impeach_D_Trump) February 23, 2017That s a very clear,  Keep your hands off me, bub,  move by Priebus. Despite that, Priebus was trying to squelch rumors that there s a rivalry between the two of them, even though the media reports otherwise:[Priebus] said he and Bannon get along and work closely together    we share an office suite together, we re basically together form 6:30 in the morning until 11 o clock at night,  he said   and that the 2016 election showed the Republican Party and the conservative movement can be united.That move, though, on Priebus  part when Bannon touched him, suggests an already established pattern of dislike between them.

 Trump Just Got Called Out As ‘Threat To Democracy’ By Admiral Who Oversaw Killing Of Bin Laden,"Donald Trump just got his ass handed to him by the retired Admiral who oversaw the raid that finally took down Osama Bin Laden.Last week, Trump viciously accused the media of treason and called them the  enemy of the American people in a tweet that has since been condemned across the country.The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017Well, one critic of Trump s tweet knows all about who our enemies really are and he called Trump out during remarks to a group of journalism students in Texas.Retired Admiral William McRaven is the Chancellor of the University of Texas System, but he is most notable for being the commander who oversaw the daring raid in Pakistan in which Osama Bin Laden was killed by SEAL Team Six ten years after Al-Qaeda terrorists perpetrated the 9/11 attacks.Six years later, Trump is referring to the press as the  enemy  while ISIS and other terrorist organizations are benefiting from his rhetoric.That doesn t sit well with McRaven, who called Trump s attack on the media  the greatest threat to democracy  on Tuesday. The president said the news media is the enemy of the American people,  McRaven said.  This sentiment may be the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime.He then urged his audience to challenge Trump s statement. I will tell you as journalism majors, as Americans, you should challenge that sentiment and that statement every opportunity you can. We must challenge this statement, and this sentiment, that the news media is the enemy of the American people. By attacking the free press like he did, Trump is on the slippery slope toward arresting and jailing journalists for doing their jobs. Conservatives are praising Trump s assault on the media, but they would have cried bloody murder if President Obama has said the same about Fox News and right-wing media outlets. Trump and conservatives hate facts because facts weaken their arguments. Facts and evidence derail their agenda and they know it. That s why they are waging war on facts. Getting rid of facts makes it easier to fool the people and easier to force a destructive agenda upon them.As Admiral McRaven said, Trump is a  threat to democracy  and the media needs to continue revealing his incompetence and treachery to the American people. Because without a free press, our freedoms would be quickly taken from us a president who fancies himself a king.Featured image via Sean Rayford/Getty Images",News,23-Feb-17

 Top Conservative Tries To Define ‘Alt-Right’ And Gets It INSANELY Wrong,"One of the problems that Republicans have is what to do about the white nationalists that are taking over the conservative movement, including the KKK and the Neo-Nazis that have come out of the woodwork since Trump began his run for the White House. Some of them are just trying to ignore it, and some are trying to claim that these groups aren t all that bad when you consider that Democrats were once the party of slavery (today s Republicans are those Democrats, actually), so they re the true racists here.And then you have idiots like the executive director of the American Conservative Union, Dan Schneider, who says that the so-called  alt-right  is really the fascist left.Speaking at CPAC, he told an audience full of conservatives: There is a sinister organization that is trying to worm its way into our ranks and we must not be duped. Just a few years ago, this hate-filled left-wing fascist group hijacked the very term  alt-right.  That term has been used for a long time in a very good and normal way. He s right, it s a  sinister organization trying to worm its way into  their ranks. But it s really a fascist left wing movement?Well, let s look at this. The  alt-right  has always been a conservative movement. It was actually conservative opposition to George W. Bush over his foreign policy. These were people who believed that W. was a liberal in conservatives  clothing who had betrayed them with his policies.They originally had some of everything   Reagan Republicans, anti-immigration hawks, libertarians, and even monarchists, and yes, white nationalists. But it wasn t like the left saw an opening, or saw cracks in the movement, and took advantage of them. It was Richard Spencer himself who, during his evolution from a conservative into one of the worst white supremacists we ve got, ultimately hijacked the term and turned it into an anti-Semitic, white nationalist movement.But since this movement now has the door it needs to shove itself into the mainstream via President Asterisk, increasing numbers of Republicans are trying to find ways to distance themselves from that kind of hate. At the same time, some obviously see an opportunity to use it to demonize the left, which riles up a different kind of hate.Schneider also said: They are anti-Semites. They are racist. They are sexist. They hate the Constitution. They hate free markets. They hate pluralism. They hate everything and despite everything we believe in. All of that is true, but they grew out of the conservative right. Not the left, but maybe he s another one of the many ignorant conservatives who believe that today s Democrats are the Democrats who fought for slavery.When you have an entire movement willing to tolerate people like Steve Bannon, Milo Yiannopoulos, Steve Miller and even Trump himself, shucking responsibility for that movement is antithetical to the conservative idea of  personal responsibility.  The GOP needs to look in a mirror if they want to find an answer to the so-called  alt-right. Featured image by Kirk Irwin via Getty Images for SiriusXM",News,23-Feb-17

Because that s what  military operation  means.Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly later clarified that troops would not be deployed to enforce immigration laws, thus giving us one more day without Trump deploying troops on American soil.Watch it for yourself below:Featured image via screengrab",News,23-Feb-17
 Ruth Bader Ginsburg Rebukes Trump In Defense Of The Free Press,"One of the most revered Supreme Court Justices in American history just hammered Donald Trump for attacking the free press without even mentioning his name.Last week, Trump accused the media of treason by calling them the  enemy of the American people. The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017His tweet drew widespread condemnation, but that didn t stop him from continuing the attack in other tweets in which he repeatedly referred to the media as  fake news  for doing accurately reporting on him and his chaotic administration.Don t believe the main stream (fake news) media.The White House is running VERY WELL. I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2017Give the public a break   The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2017Trump s assault on the free press is an assault on the Constitution. Trump apparently lied when he swore to defend it during his inauguration ceremony.But Ruth Bader Ginsberg has been defending the Constitution her whole life and she has spent the last 24 years doing so from the Supreme Court bench.During an interview with the BBC, Ginsberg stood up to Trump without mentioning him by name and defended the free press while explaining why the American people need a free press. I read the Washington Post and the New York Times every day, and I think that the reporters are trying to tell the public the truth,  she said, clearly rebuking Trump s claim that the media is lying about him.Then she pointed out that the free press was instrumental in busting the Watergate scandal wide open, which resulted in Nixon s resignation. Think of what the press has done in the United States,  Ginsberg said.  That story might never have come out if we didn t have the free press that we do. Indeed, if Trump had his way the press would act as his own propaganda machine. The press would only tell the American people what he wants them to tell them. America would be like Russia or North Korea, where the press is under the control of dictators.And that s why the free press should be defended more than ever against Trump and his authoritarian agenda.The American people need a free press that will hold Trump accountable, not one that serves as his cheerleading squad.Featured image via Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images",News,23-Feb-17
 Trump Kills MASSIVE Infrastructure Project That Would Have Created Thousands Of Jobs,"The project was set to begin on March 1st and would have brought environmentally friendly high speed rail to California.But that project is in serious jeopardy after Donald Trump s Transportation minion Elaine Chao, who also happens to be Mitch McConnell s wife, ordered an audit of the $647 million grant awarded to CalTrain to help cover the costs.Despite promising to support infrastructure programs and create more jobs in America, Trump has apparently decided to break that promise in the name of petty partisan politics.Trump has threatened California in recent weeks with funding cuts because U.C. Berkeley canceled a Milo Yiannopoulos speech. Yiannopoulos is a Trump supporter and was recently exposed as an advocate of pedophilia.Trump also threatened to defund California in retaliation of the state continuing to offer sanctuary to immigrants.  If we have to, we ll defund,  Trump said.  We give tremendous amounts of money to California. If they re going to have sanctuary cities we may have to do that   certainly that would be a weapon. And Trump apparently pulled the trigger of that  weapon  on Friday by pulling the plug on the high speed rail project.The project would have converted the rail system running between San Jose and San San Francisco to run on electricity, which would have helped fight climate change. It also would have created nearly 10,000 new jobs. It would also have increased the number of people who use the system and would have cut operation costs.Trump made the decision after 14 California Republicans sent him a letter asking him to kill the project. That s only 14 out of a delegation of 55, 40 of whom are Democrats. That means Trump willfully sided with the minority party in California on this project.Here are the names of the Republicans the people of California can blame for losing out on this major infrastructure project. They are each up for re-election in 2018.Dana Rohrabacher Darrell Issa David G. Valadao Devin Nunes Doug LaMalfa Duncan Hunter Edward Royce Jeff Denham Ken Calvert Kevin McCarthy Mimi Walters Paul Cook Stephen Knight Tom McClintockAn audit of the project would certainly be a partisan witch hunt that would take months to complete, thus killing a project that California needs and wants.It would help fight climate change, create thousands of jobs, and start America on the path to catching up with the rest of the world when it comes to bullet train transportation. This project shouldn t be canceled, it should be demanded across the country.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,23-Feb-17
 Former Trump Aides Admit They HAVE To Treat Trump Like A Man Baby And Control His Media Habits,"As more and more leaks get out, it s obvious that Donald Trump is not just a dictator, he s so insecure that aides have to hand him daily pacifiers in the form of fake and flattering news stories to keep the man baby from having even more Twitter meltdowns.The key to keeping Trump s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise. And when no such praise was to be found, staff would turn to friendly outlets to drum some up   and make sure it made its way to Trump s desk. If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable,  said former communications director Sam Nunberg.  The same media that our base digests and prefers is going to be the base for his support. I would assume the president would like to see positive and preferential treatment from those outlets and that would help the operation overall. Source: PoliticoApparently Trump s constant accusations of  fake news  has some legitimacy, but not how Trump or his supporters would like.Trump is quite selective about where he gets his news. He does read print, like the New York Times, but he also watches a lot   a lot   of Fox News. Remember when Trump touted a terrorist attack in Sweden that never happened? That allegedly came straight from Fox News.My statement as to what s happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017It was a fake story. We can t say whether it was planted by Trump s aides, but it might as well have been for all the anti-immigrant political fodder it provided.The ramifications of a president who has to be sheltered from the real news are chilling. As the administration rolls on, Trump will continue to make adversaries around the world and in the media. Trump s unfiltered Twitter habit is potentially a national security issue. His aides obviously see this, but a president who is completely out of touch with reality, and is only willing to acknowledge fawning praise is equally dangerous.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,23-Feb-17
" WATCH: Conservatives Don’t Punch Nazis, They Give Them Credentials To Attend CPAC","If there is one political ideology that every American should despise, it s Nazism. But conservatives don t seem to mind it one bit.On inauguration day last month, Nazi Richard Spencer got punched in the face by a protester during an interview.Spencer, along with others of his ilk, support Donald Trump and hail his presidency as a new era of white nationalism where fascism and racism flourish.It s no secret, of course. Conservatives have been moving further to the extreme right for decades and the end of that side of the political spectrum is Nazism.Rather than run away from Nazism and people like Spencer who advocate in favor of it, conservatives decided to give Spencer credentials to attend their annual CPAC conference.Spencer attended on Thursday, and he had a lot to say to reporters as supporters flocked to him like moths to a flame.When asked how he feels about being at CPAC, Spencer said he  feels welcome. Richard Spencer, at CPAC:  I feel very welcome here. Nobody s punching me yet.  Travis Waldron (@Travis_Waldron) February 23, 2017Spencer then praised Donald Trump for being a supporter of white nationalist causes.Richard Spencer tells reporters at @CPAC he thinks Trump represents the alt-right more than conservatives #CPAC2017 pic.twitter.com/b5dEtXVmKy  Kira Lerner (@kira_lerner) February 23, 2017CPAC organizer Matt Schlapp apparently had no problem with Spencer attending the conference despite claiming to disagree with him.Just talked to CPAC organizer Matt Schlapp. Said he didn t endorse Richard Spencer s ideas but won t kick him out of the conference.  fake Matt Pearce (@mattdpearce) February 23, 2017But then it appears someone felt that Spencer was getting too much adulation at CPAC so they had him escorted out by security.Here s the video via YouTube.Richard Spencer should never have been approved to get credentials to CPAC in the first place, especially if conservatives really don t agree with Nazism.But the fact that Spencer was allowed to attend makes it pretty clear that conservatives are more okay with Nazis than they would like us to believe. And that s an insult to the millions of Americans who fought to stop the Nazis and their evil agenda during World War II.Featured image via YouTube",News,23-Feb-17
 Ivanka Trump Tweeted About Religious Tolerance And Got Her Hypocritical A** Handed To Her,"If Ivanka Trump really believes in religious tolerance she should tell her dad instead of the Twitterverse.Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly attacked Muslims in this country, and his immigration ban targets Muslims from 7 countries just because they happen to practice Islam.Furthermore, Trump has wide support from white nationalists, who also tend to be anti-Semitic. Even Trump s top adviser Steve Bannon has been accused of being anti-Semitic. Hate crimes against Jews are on the rise, yet Trump can barely bring himself to condemn anti-Semitism.So Trump has been unsympathetic to Jews and Muslims alike, all while giving special treatment to conservative Christians.And that s precisely why his daughter Ivanka got her ass handed to her after she tweeted her support of religious tolerance on Monday.America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance.

 Angry Constituents Shame Republican By Turning Their Backs On Him During Town Hall,"Republicans should be ashamed of themselves and that s the exact message one GOP lawmaker clearly received during a town hall in Louisiana.On Wednesday, Senator Bill Cassidy insulted his constituents by arriving half an hour late to his own town hall. That gave voters extra time to get angrier.When he finally arrived, Cassidy tried to deliver a PowerPoint presentation about the supposed Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, a plan that pretty much boils down to if you get sick and you can t afford health care you die.But once he entered the door, a woman made sure Cassidy knew about a kid who was uninsurable.Woman tells  this child is uninsurable,  pointing to child standing next to her, as @BillCassidy walks in. pic.twitter.com/pCP83E9Qbw  Caitlin Owens (@caitlinnowens) February 22, 2017Then they started chanted in favor of the Affordable Care Act.Now people are holding up signs to @BillCassidy saying  you re dodging the question,  some chanting  ACA  Caitlin Owens (@caitlinnowens) February 22, 2017As it turns out, most Americans support the Affordable Care Act. Over 30 million Americans have been able to get insurance because of the law. By repealing it, Republicans are handing down a death sentence to millions of people, many of whom are their own voters. Americans would also face financial ruin because of the repeal.Cassidy s constituents were not interested in hearing about a useless Republican plan so they shamed him by turning their backs on him during the presentation, which forced him to take questions instead.Constituents turn their back on @BillCassidy as he goes through a PowerPoint of his Obamacare replacement.

" DISTURBING Footage Between Trump And Melania Revealed, Twitter ERUPTS (VIDEO/TWEETS)","If you ve ever watched Donald Trump and his wife Melania interact with each other, it s obvious that there s something strange about their relationship. As the undeserving POTUS and First Lady are now being recorded in the public eye more than ever before, their marriage has come under scrutiny and people are legitimately worried for Melania s wellbeing and safety.One recent moment of concern was captured on Saturday, when Melania gave the invocation before Trump s re-election rally in Florida. Melania began to recite the Lord s Prayer, but her body language completely changed as Trump approached her and touched her. Cosmopolitan.com scribe Madison Feller described the event like this: (Y)ou can see that before Melania began the Lord s Prayer, President Trump came over and touched her on the arm. As he does so, Melania seems to flinch and look away before saying  thank you  and moving on   around the 11 second mark in the video below. .@FLOTUS opens her remarks with the Lord s Prayer. pic.twitter.com/z0Vk6znjL8  Fox News (@FoxNews) February 18, 2017In the footage above, it s noticeable that as soon as Trump s hand touches Melania s arm, her face jerks to the left and she looks as if she might be flinching. Here s that moment again:This footage, combined with another infamous video of Melania at Trump s inauguration, certainly raises questions about how Trump is treating her. At the inauguration, Melania was shown smiling as Trump turns around to face her. He says something to her, and her smile quickly turns into a scowl:This is not the face of a happy woman.

 Trump Is ACTIVELY Working To RIP Families Away From Military Members,"A letter to the editor appeared in The New York Times yesterday about how devastating Trump s immigration policy is. It s not only going to destroy immigrant families and further harm our deteriorating relationship with Mexico; it s also going to rip apart military families. The families that keep our soldiers grounded when they re overseas in combat zones. And Trump doesn t care.David Kubat, a member of the Minnesota National Guard and also an immigration lawyer, wrote the short letter, where he said: I have personally experienced the hardship of deployments to combat zones, and know the incredible importance of family stability during that trying time. This week, this administration rescinded the Parole in Place program, harming thousands of military families across the country. This is another example of the careless excess of the administration s immigration policy. Parole in Place protects military spouses, parents and children from deportation and was put in place by President Obama. It gives servicemembers peace of mind that their families will still be here when they get home. Now they don t have that because to Trump, it seems that soldiers should have to suffer if they were dumb enough to be involved with someone who could be subject to deportation.The GOP is supposed to be the family values party, and they love claiming that they re the only party that cares about the military. It s not bad enough that they say that and then turn around and cut funding for the VA and other helpful programs. Now their standard-bearer, their leader, is actively working to destroy the very thing that keeps our military grounded.Kubat went on to say: It is unconscionable to reverse a policy that strengthens our military and our veterans. That the program was not even named in the memo demonstrates either a lack of awareness, or worse, a casual disregard of the effect that this will have on those most vulnerable members of our military. Nice job, Republicans, for allowing this shitshow to make it all the way to the White House. When we start seeing a spike in severe mental problems in our fighting men and women, we ll know exactly where to point the finger.Kubat s full letter is below:Now #Trump can deport spouses & families of US military personnel.

 Angry Constituents HILARIOUSLY Shame Their GOP Reps For Being Too Cowardly To Face Them (IMAGES),"There are a lot of Republican members of Congress who can t stand even the prospect of having their town halls disrupted by protesters, even if those protesters are their own constituents.

 Elderly Voter SHAMES Tom Cotton For Trying To Take Away Her Dying Husband’s Healthcare (VIDEO),"Vile GOP Senator Tom Cotton made the mistake of facing his constituents on Wednesday, and things could not possibly have gone worse for him   especially after one elderly woman whose healthcare he was trying to take away got ahold of him. We re doing Medicare my way, not your way. My way,  the woman told Cotton, who was one of the Republican Senators who sent a letter vowing to undo Obama s Iran deal.  I ve got a husband dying and we can t afford   let me tell you something, if you can get us better coverage than this go for it.  She then lays out the cost of her and her husband s current care: $29 for him and $39 for her   rates that no GOP plan (they still have not presented an actual plan) could beat. I have sent you one message after the other, sir, about our family,  she told her Senator, chiding him for responding to her concerns with the same form letter every single time.  I live just down the road a few places from your office, and I have invited you into our home, and not a word, except a classic, regular letter sent. Other attendees hammered Cotton for not taking a tougher stance on Russia and voiced a number of legitimate concerns.

 GOP Rep. Says People Could Use Bales Of Marijuana To Smuggle Nukes Into The Country (VIDEO),"Republicans have been coming up with some pretty ridiculous reasons for why they think we need to ban Muslims and build that stupid wall. Donald Trump and his administration have taken to making up fake terrorist attacks, which is sad enough. But now, we apparently have to worry about people smuggling nuclear weapons into our country   hidden inside bales of marijuana, no less.Rep. Trent Franks did an interview with CNN on Wednesday and was trying to explain why we need Trump s border wall. Sadly, he was being completely serious when he made this ridiculous assertion. We sometimes used to make the point that if someone wanted to smuggle a dangerous weapon into America, even a nuclear weapon, how would they do it?  he said.  The suggestion is, maybe we ll hide it in a bale of marijuana. There are national security implications here for a porous border. As a group of nations, we need to understand that America is the world s flagship of freedom. If we don t have a secure border, that hurts everyone in the long run. As absurd as this idea is, this isn t the first time it has been suggested that someone could sneak in a nuclear weapon by stuffing it inside bales of pot. Earlier this month, Rep. Brad Sherman made the comment that  missile defense is OK politically, but remember you can smuggle a nuclear weapon inside a bale of marijuana. As David Kay of the International Atomic Energy Agency explains, the scenario might not be as ridiculous as it sounds on the surface. I ve often said, my preferred method for delivering a nuclear device is, I would hide it in a bale of marijuana, contract it out to the drug lords and move it,  he said. Marijuana is a good shielder actually for radiation. The drug lords have a superb record for delivery. They re not Fed Ex, but they re awfully close to it. And contract it out and get it across the border. Even Frank Ciluffo, the director of George Washington University s Homeland Security Policy Institute, floated the idea back in 2014. If you want to smuggle in a tactical nuclear weapon, just put it in a bale of marijuana,  Ciluffo said.  Because we re not doing that well in terms of some of our drug enforcement. Luckily, we won t have to worry about any of this because Trump is going to build his massive wall and no bad people will ever be able to get into our country again!You can watch Frank s CNN interview, here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,22-Feb-17
 Kansas Tea Party Governor Gets His A** Handed To Him As Republicans Vote To Reverse Disastrous Tax Cuts,"It s about time Kansas Republicans saw the light and told Governor Sam Brownback to go f*ck himself.Kansas has been taking a beating because of Brownback s trickle-down economics policy of slashing taxes. And Republicans in the state have finally done something about it.In 2012, Brownback convinced the Republican-controlled state House and Senate to pass massive tax cuts for businesses and wealthy individuals. For the first time, conservatives employed their trickle-down policy over an entire state. And the experiment turned out to be an immediate disaster that has destroyed the state financially to the point where little revenue was coming in, creating an unsustainable budget shortfall of hundreds of millions of dollars that was only going to get worse.Republicans desperately tried to plug the budget hole by cutting education and other programs, which caused a lot of Kansans to suffer. Basically, Republicans refused to admit that their tax policies failed and hoped they could the problem without reversing the tax cuts.Unable to do so, and facing a $348 million shortfall, Republicans in Kansas passed legislation in the House and Senate designed to  raise income tax rates and end a tax exemption for roughly 330,000 business owners.  In other words, Republicans rejected Brownback s tax policy.Brownback, of course, vetoed the legislation. But lawmakers in the Kansas House formally overrode his veto on Wednesday by a huge margin of 85-40. The legislation now heads to the state Senate.If enough state senators have the backbone to stand up to their unpopular governor, revenues will start pouring into government coffers to cover the budget hole he dug and Kansas will avoid future financial ruin.For four years, Republicans denied reality by insisting that tax cuts on businesses and the wealthy somehow generate more revenue and they continue to insist on such a policy at the national level. The problem is that Republican tax policies have only created a skyrocketing national debt and trillion dollar deficits that cannot be filled by slashing things like food stamps, which only accounts for less than 4 percent of federal spending.The fact is that taxes make civilization possible. If we want things like good education, healthcare, roads, food aid, and Social Security, then we need to pay taxes to pay for them. And that includes businesses and the wealthy. Arguing otherwise on their behalf like Republicans have been doing for decades is unpatriotic and un-American. And Kansas  failed experiment proves it.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,22-Feb-17
 Trump EXPLODES Over Protests For His Obamacare Repeal. Whoopi Goldberg’s Response Is AMAZING (VIDEO),"Anyone who respects democracy and the way this country works knows that protests and rallies are just part of what Americans are allowed to do to get their point across. Donald Trump, of course, does not respect any type of protest or criticism if it goes against him, so he recently attacked Americans who are worried about their healthcare being taken away.Yesterday, Trump flipped out and attacked Americans who were protesting against his disastrous Affordable Care Act repeal on Twitter. Implying that the protesters were actually being paid off, and were part of a liberal scheme to take him down, Trump tweeted:It is completely disgusting that a president would insult and attack citizens like this, and the women of  The View  nailed him for it, unanimously agreeing that protesters have every right to be upset. Host Whoopi Goldberg called out Trump s lies perfectly when she reminded everyone that people actually rely on the Affordable Care Act for life-saving treatment and medication: People are not paid to do this. People are pissed off! She s absolutely right. People s lives will actually be threatened as the GOP works to get rid of the Affordable Care Act with no reasonable replacement. Co-host Sara Haines jumped in and added: I think there s a lot of pressure in D.C. right now considering [Donald] Trump is technically a Republican and he s overseeing this party. Right now people are feeling the pressure in D.C. to give in, pass people, do all of this stuff. These are the people that are going to vote them back in or not. I think it s a good a real reminder that at the end of the day, their power comes from those votes. While there was a bit of back and forth between co-hosts Sunny Hostin and conservative Jedediah Bila over whether or not Obamacare was cost-effective and useful to Americans (clearly, it is), co-host Joy Behar jumped in and reminded everyone that most of the people who backed Trump didn t even know that Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act were the same thing, and that those people only hated Obamacare because of their dislike for former President Barack Obama.Goldberg cut in again with some harsh criticism for Trump s plan to trash Obamacare completely: This has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act. A lot of what s happened with the insurance companies is that the insurance companies don t want to deal with this. So, we re going to punish you, so you re forced to move this. Now, here s my suggestion, because it works for a lot of people, there has to be a way, as with everything, that you use stuff that works and move what doesn t   but to come in and sweep everything out seems very crazy to me.

 REPORT: Paranoid Trump Forces Cabinet Members To Only Hire People ‘Loyal’ To Him,"Donald Trump is employing extra scrutiny to anyone his Cabinet hires to guarantee that they are loyal only to him.As he continues to whine about Democrats holding up the confirmation process for his nominees, Trump is frustrating his Cabinet members by forcing them to clear all new hires with former campaign staffers because he is paranoid that they may not be loyal to him. New hires are apparently being subjected to rigorous vetting, and if it is found that they ever criticized Trump in any way, they are dismissed.According to Politico,When an informal adviser to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos recently recommended a candidate for a high-level Senate-confirmed position at the agency, the adviser was told that the candidate had little chance of getting the job because the person had previously worked for an organization that was seen as being at odds with Trump s policy positions, one person familiar with the issue said.The same goes for the Treasury Department.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has clashed with White House officials over top officials in his department, sources say. The White House saw some of Mnuchin s picks as too liberal or not supportive enough of Trump, sources say.Even Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has had to deal with Trump s paranoia.Several high-level people were delayed or scuttled because they didn t agree with Trump during the campaign or because the White House preferred someone else.Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson has also felt Trump s wrath.At Housing and Urban Development, Shermichael Singleton, a top official, joined the department before being terminated when criticism of Trump surfaced in a final White House review.So Trump is literally firing anyone who criticizes him or has criticized him in the past, which means he isn t interested in diverse opinions or experience. He just wants a bunch of yes-men who agree with him no matter what, even if he is wrong.That s incredibly dangerous because Trump is in a job where dissenting opinions can be the difference between life and death, or war and peace. Even President Obama nominated Republicans to high-level positions and valued their input. The greatest presidents in history put together administrations that included some of their sharpest critics because they wanted differing opinions and perspectives that would help them make the best decisions. All Trump is doing is creating his own echo chamber.And because of Trump s obsession with total control and absolute loyalty, the various executive departments are very understaffed. Furthermore, Trump s insistence on scrutinizing every employee hired has apparently slowed down his own job to nominate people to positions as well. So far, he has only managed to pick less than 36 nominees to fill Senate-confirmed positions. There are over 550 such positions that need to be filled.Adding to Trump s problems is the fact that many potential hires are backing out of taking positions because they know associating themselves with Trump could ruin their reputations and careers, which is another reason why Trump is only seeking friends for positions. But Matt Sclapp, who worked for George W. Bush as his political director, correctly warned that only installing friends into government positions can seriously backfire. It often breaks down into trying to appoint your allies into jobs and that can lead to a lot of bad policy formulations,  he said.Indeed, while nominating some qualified friends is not a big deal, Trump is more interested in blind loyalty than he is in qualifications. Nominating only friends to important positions can lead to scandal, especially if those friends start using their positions to enrich themselves or give themselves government favors.Donald Trump s administration is a train wreck, and chaos and infighting reigns inside the White House as he continues to embarrass himself and the nation. Now, even his own Cabinet members are beginning to get frustrated with him, and one wonders who will be the first to resign because they have an incompetent paranoid asshole for a boss.Featured image by Mario Tama via Getty Images",News,22-Feb-17
 City Unanimously Votes To Impeach Trump; Hopes Other Cities Will Soon Follow (VIDEO),"On Tuesday night, one lone city, Richmond, California, unanimously voted to impeach Donald Trump. They hope they are only the first. Unfortunately with this president it s oddly appropriate,  said Richmond City Councilmember Jael Myrick.Councilmember Gayle McLaughlin spearheaded the resolution, which calls on Congress to investigate the president s business holdings, something his critics believe are grounds for impeachment.  This is our voice,  she said.  This is our country. We have a right to speak up. Of course, cities can t impeach a president. That s up to Congress, as one resident mentioned: Actually you don t have a voice because the GOP controls Congress and you people are stupid enough to think Congress will impeach Trump,  said Richmond resident Mark Wassberg.Another resident had an answer for that: A lot of politicians aren t willing to go on the record to do this because it can go against them,  said Richmond resident Ellen Faden.  But as grass roots, as Bernie said, we have to start from the grass roots. Source: ABC 7 NewsHere s the video:While Richmond may be the first city to formally (and yes, toothlessly) endorse impeachment, the movement is gaining momentum among the voters. So far, nearly a quarter million people have signed a Change.org petition for impeachment, and that s just the tip of the iceberg. There are other petitions as well.Whether or not it will happen is still to be seen. Trump has already violated his oath of office by profiting off of the presidency. He has already violated the Emoluments Clause in the Constitution, which states that leaders cannot accept large gifts from foreign states. There might be several examples, but the most damning is the fact that, after years of being denied a trademark for plastering his name all over China, his trademark was suddenly approved last week.Richmond is in a fortunate situation. Its Congressperson and its two Senators are all Democratic. It might just take some gentle urging from other cities and constituents to get the ball rolling. This is certainly a start, if impeachment (Pence) is what we want.Featured image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images",News,22-Feb-17
 WATCH: Republican Runs Into A Buzzsaw During Town Hall For Refusing To Investigate Trump’s Russia Scandal,"Remember when Republicans wasted millions of dollars over two years investigating Benghazi? Voters definitely remember.Republicans repeatedly and constantly used the Benghazi attacks of 2012 to persecute President Obama and Hillary Clinton. The witch hunt surpassed the length of the 9/11 investigation, and the House Select Committee on Benghazi alone cost nearly $7 million of taxpayer money.Overall, ten committees were involved in those investigations, which means the amount spent by Congress is even higher, and they forced the State Department and Defense Department to spend and additional $16 million to defend themselves.In the end, Republicans found no evidence of wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton.In contrast, Republicans have been refusing to investigate Donald Trump s ties with Russia. That scandal has continued to escalate ever since Mike Flynn resigned as National Security Adviser over his negotiations to ease sanctions with Russia prior to Trump taking office, and lying about it.Trump s dubious relationship with Russia goes back to the campaign, when he specifically asked Russian hackers to keep attacking Hillary. Many in Trump s inner circle have connections to Russia, and Trump s campaign adopted policies favorable to Putin, including less support for NATO and dropping sanctions placed on Russia for invading Ukraine. Because of Russian interference in our election process, Trump was installed in the White House as Putin s puppet, and our national security has been threatened ever since.But Republicans don t feel like investigating because they know Trump would be exposed. So when Arkansas Rep. Steve Womack held a town hall on Tuesday, he ran into a buzzsaw as his constituents called out his hypocrisy.Womack told the crowd that Russia is an  existential threat  to America, and that he opposes the deals Trump is making with Putin. But he got massively booed after he suggested Trump is only friendly with Russia because Democrats have been blocking his cabinet nominees. At the end of the day, you and I agree that Russia is a threat, and I believe that once we get the president with his people assembled around him, he will better recognize that Russia is part of the problem,  Womack said.When asked if he would support an investigation of Trump s ties with Russia, Womack refused and used the excuse that such investigations would reveal classified information. You guys just want to investigate everybody,  Womack said to more boos and jeers.It s even more insulting since Republicans literally tried to investigate every little thing that went wrong under President Obama. You guys wasted a lot of money on Benghazi, waste a little on Trump,  one constituent demanded.Afterwards, Womack referred to his constituents as an  angry mob,  and suggested they acted like children for demanding he do his damn job. I m sorry to the community that it became somewhat one-sided and not necessarily a lynch mob, but at least an angry mob that was just not going to be happy with anything I said, and it took away from the ability for us to have what I believe we need to have, and that s a good, adult-level discussion. Here s the video via YouTube.Republicans should be called out for not investigating Trump. We are talking about our national security and the sanctity of our elections. If they are going to put party and power above our country, they have no business serving in Congress.Featured image via screen capture",News,22-Feb-17
 Trump Just Tried To ‘Compliment’ Democrat Keith Ellison. Ellison’s Response Is ALL Of Us (TWEETS),"Donald Trump just got absolutely humiliated on Twitter after he made a pathetic attempt to cozy up to Minnesota Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison with a compliment.Trump kicked off Wednesday morning with a tweet about Ellison, complimenting the Democrat in his effort to head up the Democratic National Committee. Of course, no Trump compliment is complete without the undeserving president bragging about himself, so Trump congratulated Ellison for predicting that he would win the election:Trump is referring to the time Ellison spoke with ABC s  This Week  in 2015, in which Ellison weighed in on the 2016 election. In the segment, Ellison spoke up and warned Americans that even though no one was taking Trump very seriously, he might have a real chance of becoming the Republican nominee, and might even win the presidency. Ellison had said: Anybody from the Democratic side of the fence who s terrified of the possibility of President Trump better vote, better get active, better get involved because this man has got some momentum. We better be ready for the fact that he may be leading the Republican ticket. Any idiot could see that Ellison is actually against Trump in that statement, and was trying to mobilize people to get out and vote against the former reality television star. But of course, Trump is a moron and still decided to compliment Ellison for saying he had a chance at winning the election.It seriously backfired on him less than two hours later. Ellison, who has been criticizing Trump ever since the beginning of his disastrous, shameful presidency, saw Trump s tweet and practically destroyed him:Brutal   and so perfect all at once! Guess Trump is going to be spending the rest of his day attacking Ellison just hours after complimenting him now Featured image via Drew Angerer and Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,22-Feb-17
 New Information Shows Comey’s Campaign-Ending Clinton FBI Probe Was COMPLETELY Political (DETAILS),"We are stuck with Donald Trump as the most dangerous and incompetent president in history for either the next four years or until he is impeached. If he is impeached, we re stuck with a bona fide theocrat in Mike Pence. It didn t have to be this way, though, and we quite possibly have one man to thank for it: Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey.By now, we are all aware that the insane probe into Hillary Clinton s private email server was closed in July. Despite much GOP hand-wringing, it was found that there was nothing to see there. However, despite his decision not to pursue criminal charges, Comey took an unprecedented step and held a press conference telling the American people that Hillary was reckless in her actions in a scathing rebuke that, of course, would turn voters who were on the fence against her. In addition to that, just eleven days out from Election Day, Comey sent a letter to Congress, which of course made it into the press, saying that he may be re-opening the probe due to some nonsense about Hillary s aide, Huma Abedin, and her husband Anthony Weiner s computer in a completely unrelated investigation. Of course, nothing was there, but the damage was already done. This could very well be what tipped the election in favor of Donald Trump in the minds of undecided voters. After all, plenty of people made up their minds at the last minute.One attorney is, quote,  appalled  at Comey s actions. After filing a Freedom of Information Act request to have the warrant for Hillary s emails released, Randy Schoenberg of Los Angeles, California, says of what the FBI Director did, via USA Today: I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between  Clinton and Abedin, Schoenberg said in an email to USA TODAY. It remains unknown  why they thought they might find evidence of a crime, why they felt it necessary to inform Congress, and why they even sought this search warrant,  he said.  I am appalled.  The FBI s Manhattan office did not immediately return a call seeking comment.Brian Fallon, who of course was a Clinton campaign official, echoed these sentiments via Twitter, saying that unsealed filings regarding Huma s emails reveals Comey s intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time. So, in other words, it is very possible that Comey did this in an effort to tip the scales in Trump s favor. Then again, considering that there was an entire article written during the campaign saying that the  FBI is Trumpland, this really should be no surprise whatsoever. If they wanted to tilt things to Trump, they had the perfect way to do it, especially considering all of the horrible news coming out about Trump.These revelations are especially damning, considering that it has now been revealed that the FBI withheld information regarding an investigation into Trump and his campaign s ties to Russia. To that end, Comey definitely messed with our democracy in what is beginning to look like a criminal act. They hated Hillary so much at the FBI that the director himself manipulated the electoral process to give us a Trump presidency.James Comey needs to be investigated himself, but of course that isn t going to happen under a GOP White House, Department of Justice, and Congress.Shame on you, Director Comey. Representative Maxine Waters was right   you have no credibility, and should resign immediately.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,22-Feb-17
" Ivanka Trump’s Business Gets Slapped With A Lien For Owing Over $5,000 In Unpaid Taxes","Not paying taxes and being in debt appears to be a Trump family tradition.Like her father, Ivanka Trump apparently has a problem paying her taxes and it turns out she owes thousands.Her business has taken a lot of major hits recently as retailers drop her products due to poor sales and boycotts. After Nordstrom s dropped her products, Donald Trump lashed out at them on Twitter and Kellyanne Conway resorted to peddling Ivanka s products on Fox News, which violated ethics rules and put Ivanka in an even worse position.Now the state of New York has slapped her jewelry store with a lien for failing to pay taxes.Ivanka Trump owns Trump Fine Jewelry, a store operated in Trump Tower in New York that sells items starting at $1,000 and as high as $20,000.And just like her father, Ivanka doesn t think she should have to pay her taxes either.In January, New York filed a lien against Ivanka s jewelry business for owing $5,000 in unpaid taxes, an amount that is still not paid off.One would think that a person as wealthy as Ivanka would just pay her taxes and move on but Ivanka seems to just want to move on without paying what she owes as if she is somehow entitled to not pay taxes just because her daddy is in the White House.But that s not how it works. If a person owes taxes they are obligated under the law to pay them.And this isn t the first time Ivanka has tried to escape paying her debts. Just last year, she was ordered to pay over $3 million to KGK Jewelry for failing to pay them for services rendered. Again, her father has a history of failing to pay contractors for doing jobs.One has to wonder how much debt Donald Trump owes to his own creditors. After all, Trump often does business with banks overseas because American banks refuse to give him loans since he is a credit risk. Only Trump s taxes would give us definitive knowledge of Trump s finances.But now we know that his daughter definitely does not pay her taxes. And she must have learned it from someone, and there s no one better at failing to pay taxes than Donald Trump.Featured image via Joe Scarnici/Getty Images",News,22-Feb-17
 GOP Lawmaker To Trump: Stop Acting Like A ‘Fragile’ Snowflake Over Town Hall Protests,"Angry constituents have inundated town hall meetings over concerns of Obamacare being repealed and other issues. There is so much frustration with constituents over Trump s policies that Republicans in Congress are avoiding in-person town hall meetings. Vice News reports that 200 Republicans in Congress are skipping town hall meetings with their constituents in February. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) will not allow protesting, or what he calls  disruptive behavior  at his upcoming town hall Wednesday or the event will be canceled. Specifically, no  chanting  will be allowed at the Snowflake s event. Of course, we never heard the same to be said when tea partiers descended on Democratic lawmaker s town hall meetings and shut them down over Obamacare. Republicans are feeling the heat and so is the alleged president. The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists.

 Angry Voters Run Joni Ernst Out Of Town After She Tells Them To Save More Money After GOP Kills Obamacare (VIDEO),"Joni Ernst may portray herself as tough in her campaign ads, but in real life she s about as yellow as the bedsheets of a certain Russian hotel after a Trump visit. Ernst had planned a small  veterans roundtable  in Maquoketa City Hall in her home state of Iowa, but she found herself met by a packed room with more crammed into the hallways of the building.Ernst slinked in a side door to avoid protesters and called almost exclusively on veterans, but one of them asked her a question that made her turn tail and run: All we hear is repeal and replace, but we don t hear about a real clear plan, other than talking about health savings accounts, which really amounts to your own money, quite frankly. And he s right. A Health savings account doesn t quite make sense if you don t have the money to pay into it, or if you suffer chronic conditions, or if you encounter even a moderately expensive health need. Nevertheless, Ernst went through her preplanned talking points as the audience jeered, booed, and mocked her   especially when she got to the part about HSAs being awesome.#Ernst is put on the spot on Obamacare by an enrollee. Her answer: Cite a couple provisions and tout HSAs.

 Trump Demanded The Anne Frank Center ‘Praise’ Him For Finally Denouncing Antisemitism; Their Response Is EPIC (TWEETS),"When White House spokesliar Sean Spicer demanded that the Anne Frank Center praise Donald Trump for, for the first time since he became President, denouncing the rash of antisemitic violence and other crime that has popped up since his election.Traditionally, Trump has been terrible with even acknowledging that bad things happen to Jewish people. even omitting them from his Holocaust announcement. But for the first time   that can t be emphasized enough   he named Jews as the actual victims of antisemitism: The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil. While some praised Trump for  finally doing the right thing, for most it was too little too late   especially when it s considered that his staff is overflowing with Nazis, white nationalists, white supremacists, alt-Righters, and other synonyms. His statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting Antisemitism, yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record,  Steven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, wrote in a Facebook post.  Make no mistake: The Antisemitism coming out of this Administration is the worst we have ever seen from any Administration.  He added: The White House repeatedly refused to mention Jews in its Holocaust remembrance, and had the audacity to take offense when the world pointed out the ramifications of Holocaust denial. And it was only yesterday, Presidents  Day, that Jewish Community Centers across the nation received bomb threats, and the President said absolutely nothing. When President Trump responds to Antisemitism proactively and in real time, and without pleas and pressure, that s when we ll be able to say this President has turned a corner. This is not that moment. I think he s been very forceful with his denunciation of people who seek to attack people because of their religion, because of their gender, because of the color of their skin,  Spicer lied in response.  It is something that he s going to continue to fight and make very, very clear has he has no place in this administration. Trump, of course, chose an  alt-right  scumbag named Stephen Miller, who has ties to white supremacist Richard Spencer, as a senior adviser and has handed anti-semitic, racist hatemonger Steve Bannon so much power that  many people are saying  he s actually the President. It s ironic that no matter how many times he talks about this, it s never good enough,  Spicer whined, ignoring that Trump literally has never actually defended persecuted  Jewish people before. The Anne Frank Center, he says, needs to get with the program and sing The Donald s praises: I wish that they had praised the president for his leadership in this area, and I think that hopefully as time continues to go by, they recognize his commitment to civil rights, to voting rights, to equality for all Americans. The Center shot back on Twitter, giving them a condition that would cause them to do that   fire the most blatant and terrible Nazi on staff: @WhiteHouse says our org should ""praise"" @POTUS @realDonaldTrump on #Antisemitism   THEN FIRE STEVE BANNON. https://t.co/gGaoL0buc9  AnneFrankCenter(US) (@AnneFrankCenter) February 21, 2017.@WhiteHouse Sean Spicer you are wrong to claim @POTUS has addressed #Antisemitism many times.

 Swedish Police APPALLED At Level Of Deception In Film Trump Blamed For His ‘Terror Attack’ Lie,"When Donald Trump pulled a terror attack in Sweden out of his ass at a Florida rally over the weekend, he tried to cover his lie by saying he was referencing a documentary about rising crime in Sweden. That documentary blames Sweden s immigrant and refugee population for the crime, and Fox News  Tucker Carlson ran a portion of an interview between filmmaker Ami Horowitz and a couple of Swedish police officers from that documentary.And what Horowitz did with it has these two officers in complete shock. Horowitz says that Muslim refugees are responsible for a sharp increase in gun violence and rape, which is the basis of his documentary. One officer says that the interview was about areas with high rates of crime, but there was no focus on migration or immigration: We don t stand behind it. It shocked us. He has edited the answers. We were answering completely different questions in the interview. This is bad journalism. Paranoia and racism generally make for bad journalism, but fear-mongering conservatives don t seem to care. Tucker Carlson should have known better than to air a segment to push the right s anti-immigrant agenda, but he didn t. And Horowitz is trying to defend his  investigation  despite the horror his own interview subjects have expressed over the editing. He even claims he told them this would be about migrants and immigrants.But Horowitz also claims that the officers are the ones who used the term  no-go zones  to describe communities that have large Muslim-immigrant populations. For the record,  no-go zones  has been a rumor circulating around conservative media for quite some time   they like to claim that these zones are only open to Muslims, and some of them are so strict that any non-Muslim caught there faces punishment under Sharia law, and outside of the country s law. Local police are said to avoid these areas entirely.It s also a flat-out lie.But Horowitz tried to reclaim some credibility by saying his  record stands for itself: I ve never had a subject claim, and certainly not prove, that I ever misled them or ever doctored the footage. It s never happened before. So, my record stands for itself, and what you saw on that video clear as day stands for itself. The big question is, what possible motive would these two officers have to discredit Horowitz and Fox News? Horowitz says their bosses pressured them to disavow the interviews so they wouldn t be labeled racists. That s not likely true because, if nothing else, the data shows that despite the spike in migrants in Sweden over the last several years, crime has not similarly risen, let alone skyrocketed.You have a problem when your interview subjects say,  That s not what we said, that s not what we meant, that s not even what we were asked about.  Horowitz and Carlson owe the world an apology, but it seems that conservative personalities increasingly believe personal responsibility only applies to other people.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,21-Feb-17
" Muslims Raise $20,000 In THREE HOURS To Fix Vandalized Jewish Cemetery As Trump Does Nothing","Ever since Donald Trump was elected by a minority of the population, along with a technicality provided by an outdated system that was put in place to preserve the power of slave owners, it seems like we can t go a week or even a day without someone committing a crime targeting Jews. Though Trump finally denounced anti-Semitism for the first time on Tuesday, his administration has largely been silent as anti-Semitic hate crimes have been on the rise since we kinda, sorta  elected  him.Asked last Wednesday about the rise in anti-Semitism that strangely accompanies his presidency, Trump replied that  We are, you know, very honored by the victory that we had. I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory we had   316 Electoral College votes. We were not supposed to crack 220. You know that, right?  This sort of response is what is expected, of course, from someone who drained the swamp and put the scum he found at the bottom   which includes quite a few actual f*cking Nazis (and other white supremacists) like Steve Bannon, Jeff Sessions, and Stephen Miller   in his administration. Team Trump has even completely failed Jewish people   but you know who hasn t? Muslims.After a historic Jewish cemetery in Missouri was vandalized Monday, Muslims in the area went to work to help their fellow humans out. More than 100 headstones at the Chesed Shel Emeth Society cemetery in the University City suburb of St. Louis were damaged and overturned following this disgusting act of destruction, which left workers struggling to fix what they could and documenting what needed to be replaced.Scene at Chesed Shel Emeth Jewish Cemetery in U-City. Crews starting to make repairs to vandalized headstones. pic.twitter.com/JX0SmpIvVm  Chris Regnier (@chrisregniertv) February 21, 2017A crowdfunding campaign started by the Muslim community reached its goal of $20,000 in just three hours, with the amount of money going toward fixing the cemetery still steadily growing.Linda Sarsour of MPower Change says the campaign is inspired by the Prophet Muhammad s love for humanity:While these senseless acts have filled us with sorrow, we reflect on the message of unity, tolerance, and mutual protection found in the Constitution of Medina: an historic social contract between the Medinan Jews and the first Muslim community. We are also inspired by the example of our Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, who stood up to pay respects for a passing Jewish funeral procession. When questioned on why he stood for a Jewish funeral, he responded,  Is it not a human soul?  [Source: Bukhari]. Through this campaign, we hope to send a united message from the Jewish and Muslim communities that there is no place for this type of hate, desecration, and violence in America,  she says.  We pray that this restores a sense of security and peace to the Jewish-American community who has undoubtedly been shaken by this event. Donald Trump and his supporters may go out of their way to demonize Muslims, but we will never, ever, ever, ever see this sort of humanity displayed by anyone associated with him.Watch a report on this latest anti-Semitic attack below:Featured image via screengrab",News,21-Feb-17
 Trump Just TOTALLY Screwed Our Military And Their Children,"One by one, Donald Trump is screwing over everyone he promised to help when he wanted their votes. Today, it was our military veterans and their small children who got the shaft, thanks to Trump s policies. A memorandum was leaked online explaining to Army families with young kids that the early education programs they have come to rely on are coming to an end just one week from today as a result of Trump s hiring freeze. The memo announced that United States Army Garrison (USAG) Wiesbaden CYS Part-Day Programs would no longer be available as of March 1. These programs include the Strong Beginnings, Part-Day Preschool, and Part-Day Toddler programs.Printed on Army letterhead, the document clearly states that  this closure is a result of staff shortage due to the Federal hiring Freeze. This Hiring Freeze prevents CYS from replacing staff who depart for any reason to include normal rotation.  Because they are unable to hire new teachers, thanks to Trump s hiring freeze, they have found themselves with only enough staff to  operate mandatory core programs. According to the memorandum,  Part-Day programs are being closed to sustain Full-Day programs that are essential for military readiness. The last day for these Part-Day programs will be February 28. It is with deep regret that USAG Wiesbaden CYS must take this action; however, mandated core services that support Soldier readiness must be maintained and this can only be done by moving staff into the core programs from the Part-Day programs,  the memo reads.  It is our intention to once again offer these Part-Day programs as soon as we are authorized to hire and have sufficient trained staff on board. On the campaign trail, Trump swore up and down that he was going to take care of the men and women who serve in our military. But, like most other things he has said, this has turned out to be just one more broken promise. And now, it is the children of those who are willing to give their lives for this country that are ultimately getting screwed.If you don t think @realDonaldTrump s #hiringfreeze hurts our military, and military families, think again.

Trump is already on track to issue more executive orders than President Obama ever did and he is on pace to spend more time on vacation as well.According to research by the Washington Post, Donald Trump may be the laziest president America has ever had to put up with.Of the 744 hours he has spent in office, Trump 293 hours not working while in Washington DC, 25 hours golfing, 13 hours tweeting, and 106 hours at Mar-a-Lago. That s a total of 437 hours of Trump not being on the job.In contrast, Trump has only spent a pathetic six hours in intelligence briefings and only 21 hours dealing with foreign relations. And can we really count all of the time Trump has spent whining about the press and bragging about himself as work time? Probably not.Here s the chart via The Washington Post.Trump promised he wouldn t have time to play golf because he would be working so hard, but he is already on pace to surpass the number of rounds President Obama played during his first term. Trump has also taken three trips to Palm Beach in Florida to stay at his resort at a cost of $10 million to taxpayers thus far, meaning Trump is on pace to shatter the 8-year $90 million price tag of President Obama s vacations and the number of days President Obama spent on vacation within his first year on the job.Considering how much conservatives whined and bitched about President Obama s golfing and vacations, the fact that they haven t complained once about Trump s is absolute hypocrisy. Compared with Obama, Trump is much worse.And as for those executive orders, Trump has signed 12 so far and that comes out to 136 this year, which means he ll sign more in two years than President Obama did in eight years if he stays on this pace. As we know, conservatives complained every time President Obama signed an executive order, claiming that executive orders undermine Congress. But apparently, conservatives have no problem with Trump acting like a king. And those orders have done nothing but cause chaos and hurt people while keeping government agencies from doing their jobs.Rather than working for the American people like he claimed he would, Trump is treating the most important job in the world like it s not much of a priority. In fact, he only seems interested in tweeting, bragging about himself during press conferences, and playing golf at a time when the world needs steady, hard-working leadership. And since Trump s  work  has mostly caused chaos, one can hardly say that he is working on behalf of the people. He s only interested in causing more problems and helping himself.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,21-Feb-17
 Milo Goes Down In Flames As His Career At Breitbart Comes To A HUMILIATING End (DETAILS),"The fall of professional troll and far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos continues, as he has now resigned from the place that made him a young conservative star, Breitbart News. Milo began his time at Breitbart as a tech editor, and his antics eventually got him promoted to Senior Editor. Now, all of that is over as multiple videos surfaced of him defending pederasty. Said tapes also cost him a speaking slot at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and the deal with publishers Simon and Schuster for a provocative book he had written, entitled Dangerous.Milo released a statement saying the following of his resignation: Breitbart News has stood by me when others caved I would be wrong to allow my poor choice of words to detract from my colleagues  important reporting, so today I am resigning from Breitbart, effective immediately. This decision is mine alone. The assertion that no one forced Milo s resignation is highly suspect, considering that there was reporting that  at least half a dozen Breitbart employees had threatened to walk out if Milo wasn t removed from the site s employ. Of course, Breitbart is sticking by the idea that Milo is some kind of bastion of conservative thought, rather than the walking, talking, YouTube troll that he actually is. They released their own statement, saying: Milo Yiannopoulos s bold voice has sparked much-needed debate on important cultural topics confronting universities, the LGBTQ community, the press, and the tech industry. Milo notified us this morning of his decision to resign as editor of Breitbart Tech and we accepted his resignation. Milo insists that this is not the last we have heard of him, though, and says that he will be starting his own media company instead of using Breitbart as the platform his filth: I will be announcing a new, independently-funded media venture of my own and a live tour in the coming weeks. I don t intend to go head-to-head with Breitbart, but I intend to do more of the same, just not under the Breitbart banner. Hopefully, said venture is a colossal failure now that Milo is such a toxic presence to so many people. Literally any outside donor, network, or media company that touches him or his effort to re-brand will be immediately hit with boycotts and public scorn, and rightfully so. But   we do live in the age over-saturation of news, so likely people will forget Milo s controversies after awhile, he ll rise from his swamp to spew his hate another day. Sad, but true.Featured image via video screen capture from YouTube",News,21-Feb-17
" Sean Spicer EXPLODES At Anne Frank Center, Viciously Attacks Trump Critics (VIDEO)","Today, Donald Trump  and his team pissed off the Anne Frank Center over his pathetically late condemnation of anti-Semitic crimes while visiting the National Museum of African American History.Earlier today, Trump tried to denounce hate crimes targeted against Jewish people, and the Anne Frank Center correctly pointed out that Trump should have denounced those attacks far sooner, especially since Trump and his administration s actions have perfectly reflected anti-Semitism. The Center said: His statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting anti-Semitism, yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record. Make no mistake: The Antisemitism coming out of this Administration is the worst we have ever seen from any Administration. It was a powerful statement, and it was 100% true. Unfortunately, the way Trump s team has chosen to handle that feedback is disgraceful. Later that day, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer threw a fit and complained that Trump was never good enough  for human rights organizations like the Anne Frank Center. Spicer said: I saw the statement. I wish that they had praised the President for his leadership in this area. The president has made clear since the day he was elected, and frankly going back to the campaign, that he is someone who seeks to unite this country. He brings a diverse group of folks into his administration, both in terms of actual positions and people who he sought the advice of. And I think he has been very forceful with his denunciation of people who seek to attack people because of their hate, because of their religion, because of their gender, because of the color of their skin. And it s something he s going to continue to fight and make very, very clear that [it] has no place in this administration. But it s ironic that no matter how many times he talks about this, it s never good enough. Today, I think, was an unbelievably forceful comment by the President as far as his denunciation of the actions that are currently targeted towards Jewish community centers. But I think that he s been very clear previous to this. Spicer pretty much serves as Trump s little attack dog, jumping on anyone who criticizes him and calls it like it is. Here s a news flash, though   people treat Trump as if he s not good enough because he s NOT good enough! He s incompetent, ignorant and has no idea what he s doing   and it shows. For Spicer to go after the Anne Frank Center in defense of Trump is absolutely unforgivable. You can watch Spicer come unhinged below: Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,21-Feb-17
 North Carolina Tea Partiers Just ADMITTED They Are The True Terrorists; Trump Administration Does Nothing,"Since Donald Trump began his run for the president, there has been one clear message: if you aren t white (preferably male) and Christian, you aren t a true American. Add that to the Tea Party, which started when Barack Obama was elected president (they didn t care about taxation enough to organize when there were white presidents), and we have a recipe for violence. In North Carolina, the Tea Party is threatening just that toward Muslims and the Trump administration, at least so far, is silent.About a third of Americans believe that if we let Muslim immigrants in, our country will be subjected to  Sharia law,  which is about the equivalent of Biblical law, which those Americans have no problem with. Sharia law, like Biblical law, would be a direct violation of the Constitution, but the only part they know of is the Second Amendment, which brings us to what these Tea Partiers want to do to Muslims they want to  kill the hell out of  them.The meeting was held in a North Carolina seafood restaurant and it included about two dozen Tea Partiers, many of whom are part of right-wing militia groups. Do you have any recommendations as to how we could stop this?  asked Frank del Valle, a Winston-Salem resident whose Facebook page identifies him as a retired federal employee and native of Cuba, near the end of the hourlong presentation.  Because my only recommendation is to start killing the hell out them. Source: Triad City BeatAccording to the group, they aren t the only ones: Political correctness is being thrown away,  he said.  A lot of people are meeting like this. We re making progress in the positive direction.  He argued for supporting reformers in the Muslim faith, adding,  We need to talk about how we can get things done peacefully. Be ready for the worst. I am beyond that point,  del Valle replied.  I m ready to start taking people out. That damned Sharia law is everywhere: The Muslim Brotherhood is behind all that terrorism and violent acts, but they re also here operating in America in a very stealthy mode,  he said.  They ve infiltrated the judiciary. They have judges that are elected to the bench. These judges are expected to make rulings from the bench here in America according to sharia law even though it s not a sharia court. If you ve got a Muslim judge he s required to try you under sharia law. These people are in high positions of influence often behind the scenes in government, academia, medicine, the media. How many of you have been to a hospital and seen the doctors that are running around in the hospital? Actually, judges are required to NOT try people under Sharia law and the vast majority of doctors are white, but the Tea Party has never been good with facts.These Tea Partiers are feeling empowered these days, for good reason. Trump has all but eliminated any references to right-wing terrorism, which is very real and already underreported. If Trump denounces right-wing extremism, he will be denouncing his most loyal base and that isn t going to happen.Featured image via Phillipp Guelland/Getty Images",News,21-Feb-17
 Chuck Schumer: Republicans Have ‘Real Problems’ With Trump Behind Closed Doors (VIDEO),"Republicans may act like they have faith in Donald Trump when the cameras are rolling, but if you ask them in private, they have some serious issues with his trainwreck of a presidency.On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told the ladies of The View that Republicans have  real problems  with Trump when you speak to them behind closed doors. When you talk to Republicans quietly   you know, in the cloak room and the gym   they are having real problems with him,  Schumer replied.  Now, very few   John McCain, to his credit   but very few have had the courage to oppose hime even though they know he s doing a lot of things that are against what America is all about My prediction is that if he keeps up on this path   which is likely, I don t think he ll change   within three or four months you re going to see a whole lot of Republicans breaking with him. And that s the salvage of America. That is the hope of America. Schumer continued, noting that Trump has assembled the  worst cabinet I ve ever seen in the history of America.  He then predicted that in a matter of months Trump will push Republicans to a point where they have  no choice  but to turn on him.Schumer explained that Trump had  campaigned as a populist against both the Democratic and Republican establishments.  If he continued on that path, he might  have some successes,  Schumer said. But what Trump has done is  move to the hard, hard right, way beyond what most Republicans are for,  and because of this, he will  be a failure. Schumer doesn t think Trump is going to change anytime soon, but he does think that there will come a time when Republicans will step up and put a stop to this madness. Or at least he hopes so. I do think, and hope and pray, that a lot of the Republicans   they re mainstream people, I don t agree with them on the issues but they re good people   that they will feel they have no choice but to break with him. The minority leader also added that Trump s attacks on the press, in particular, are  trouble for the democracy. Watch the segment here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,21-Feb-17
" Kellyanne Conway Agrees With Comparison Of Obama Appointees To Terrorists, Whines About Obstruction","Unable to spew her toxic bullshit on various media outlets, Kellyanne Conway appeared on right-wing radio instead.Republicans have conveniently ignored the fact that they obstructed President Obama for eight years. And that includes a nearly year long refusal to grant Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland a fair confirmation hearing. Republicans even blocked one Obama nominee so long that she died waiting to serve her country.So every time Republicans complain about Democrats obstructing Trump, they are being hypocrites.And Conway was a whining hypocrite during an appearance on Hugh Hewitt s radio show on Tuesday and failed to disagree with Hewitt after he compared President Obama s appointees to terrorists. I just want him to do, there are sleeper cells of Obama appointees throughout this government who are in political jobs,  Hewitt said  They re not civil servants, and I want them, I really want them gone yesterday. Hewitt wants Donald Trump to just fire all of Obama s appointees, which would leave several positions unfilled as the Senate continues to hold hearings for Trump s nominees.Hewitt then asked Conway if Trump will use recess appointments to fill all of the government posts in one shot, a dubious appointment method that Republicans repeatedly warned President Obama against doing. Would you push that, because we ve got to stand up to this government, and Senate Democrats are not going to do anything to assist us in getting going,  Hewitt said.Not only did Conway fail to call Hewitt out for comparing President s Obama s appointees to terrorists, she admitted that Trump could pull the trigger on recess appointments, which would allow hundreds of nominees to fill posts without confirmation by the Senate. Everything s on the table,  she said. All of that is being discussed, Hugh. And you make some excellent points. You re right about the Democrats. I mean, to see sort of congenital, presumptive obstruction and negativity is very concerning, because it just means that the government can t function fully, and that they re obstructing regardless of who the individual is that s being considered, regardless of the post that needs to be filled. And it s very frustrating. Gee, that sounds a lot like what Republicans have been doing over the last eight years. Except that Democrats are obstructing because Trump is picking nominees who are unqualified.The hypocrisy here is absolutely unprecedented. If President Obama had immediately fired every appointee of George W. Bush, Republicans would have screamed bloody murder.And the fact is that as much as Republicans are whining about Democratic obstruction, turnabout is fair play. If Republicans wanted Democrats to work with them they should have thought about that before treating President Obama the way they did over the last eight years. From the very first day of President Obama s administration, Senate Republicans vowed to obstruct him. They refused to cooperate with him on anything. And now that the same thing is happening to them, they have no right to complain and they only have themselves to blame.Comparing Democrats to terrorists is totally un-American and just demonstrates that Democrats have a duty to continue obstructing Donald Trump and his extreme conservative agenda. And by not disputing Hewitt s comparison, Conway just demonstrated why she should never be allowed on television again.Featured image via screenshot",News,21-Feb-17
 Trump Finally Visited A Black History Museum And He Complained About The Cost,"It s Black History Month and before Tuesday, Donald Trump s only acknowledgement seemed to be telling a female African-American reporter to set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus, you know, because black people all know each other and working women are all secretaries.On Tuesday, though, Trump finally visited the African-American History section of the Smithsonian. He delivered some platitudes, but he also took the opportunity to brag about himself and his win and he complained about the cost of the museum.First, the not so horrible: It s a privilege to be here today,  Trump said at the museum.  This museum is a beautiful tribute to so many American heroes, heroes like Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Rosa Parks, the Greensboro students and the African-American Medal of Honor recipients, among so many other really incredible heroes. Source: Talking Points MemoTrump also made a vow to  fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms.  Of course, he could say that to his supporters rather than to victims of  bigotry, intolerance and hatred,  but still, the sentiment, sincere or not (it wasn t), was there.It didn t take long for Trump to start in with his usual bragging, though.Trump also thanked Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) for joining him at the museum. A friend of mine, a great, great senator from South Carolina. I like the state of South Carolina,  he said.  I like all those states where I won by double, double, double digits. Nothing earth shattering there. Trump loves his winning states and hates the states that dared exercise their democratic right to vote against him. It was the last part that hasn t been reported much in the media, but was particularly eye opening.He wrapped up his speech by saying that the museum was built with  tremendous love and passion,  not to mention  lots of money. I just have to say that what they ve done here is something that can probably not be duplicated. It was done with love and lots of money.  Trump said.  Lots of money. We can t avoid that. To be fair, the museum did cost about $540 million   half of it paid from private donors. As for the taxpayer funded portion, it only represented about .00007 percent of the federal budget. It s also approximately the cost of us sending the Trumps to Mar-A-Lago every weekend for about two years.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,21-Feb-17
 The Anne Frank Center Just TORCHED Trump For Pathetic And Late Condemnation Of Anti-Semitism,"Donald Trump does not care about Jewish people. If he did, he would have strongly condemned anti-Semitism long ago instead of pandering to groups that commit it.In cities across the country on Monday, Jewish community centers were evacuated after receiving bomb threats.This is yet another escalation of the attack on Jewish people in America since Trump was elected in November. Hate crimes are on the rise, and so is anti-Semitism. Trump has been repeatedly called upon to condemn anti-Semitism but he has refused to do so or only weakly does so because he would lose his supporters on the extreme right-wing.On Tuesday, a full day after the bomb threats, Trump finally made a short statement pathetically denouncing anti-Semitism. The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,  Trump said.Of course, Trump has contributed to this hate by ignoring it and has insulted Jews ever since taking office a month ago.Shortly after Trump s late statement, Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect Executive Director Steven Goldstein scolded Trump in a statement. The President s sudden acknowledgement is a Band-Aid on the cancer of anti-Semitism,  he began. His statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting anti-Semitism, yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record. Make no mistake: The Antisemitism coming out of this Administration is the worst we have ever seen from any Administration.The White House repeatedly refused to mention Jews in its Holocaust remembrance, and had the audacity to take offense when the world pointed out the ramifications of Holocaust denial. And it was only yesterday, President s Day, that Jewish Community Centers across the nation received bomb threats, and the President said absolutely nothing.When President Trump responds to anti-Semitic proactively and in real time, and without pleas and pressure, that s when we ll be able to say this President has turned a corner. This is not that moment. .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump do not make us Jews settle for crumbs of condescension. What are you going to do about #Antsemitism in @WhiteHouse pic.twitter.com/95Z5GP1OBc  AnneFrankCenter(US) (@AnneFrankCenter) February 21, 2017Trump s campaign was heavily supported by Nazis and Trump even hired a Nazi by making Steve Bannon his top adviser. So while Trump s statement on Tuesday is a start, it s not enough because his anti-Semitic supporters still believe he is one of them and that he doesn t really believe what he s saying when he  condemns  them. That s because Trump s statement was weak and his previous actions and words make it clear that he is not a friend to Jews.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,21-Feb-17
 These Countries Just Stood Up For Women’s Rights And Spat In Trump’s Face (DETAILS),"Other nations are stepping up to play larger roles in the world because of Donald Trump, proving that he is destroying American respect and power abroad.One of Trump s first acts after taking over the White House was to issue a global gag rule on abortion.The executive order bans groups that receive funding from the United States from giving women information on abortion, reversal of President Obama s policy that had been in effect for the last eight years.Apparently, conservatives believe they not only have the right to tell American women what to do with their bodies, they believe they have the right to tell all women around the world what to do with their bodies as well.Trump s policy is an embarrassing shift. Women around the world will now see America as a hostile enemy of women s rights and bodily autonomy.And as a result of of the United States abandoning women around the world, other nations are sticking it to Trump by filling the gaps.According to Reuters,Norway has joined an international initiative to raise millions of dollars to replace shortfalls left by U.S. President Donald Trump s ban on U.S.-funded groups worldwide providing information on abortion.In January, the Netherlands started a global fund to help women access abortion services, saying Trump s  global gag rule  meant a funding gap of $600 million over the next four years, and has pledged $10 million to the initiative to replace that.Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg, Finland, Canada and Cape Verde have all also lent their support.Norway is also chipping in $10 million. The government is increasing its support for family planning and safe abortion, Prime Minister Erna Solberg said in a statement.  At a time when this agenda has come under pressure, a joint effort is particularly important. So Donald Trump just hurt American prestige by doing something that will hurt women around the globe. But other nations are boosting their own prestige by filling the funding gap.Abortion is a medically necessary procedure that women should have access to no matter where they live. By trying to deny women that access, Donald Trump is putting lives at risk and taking rights away from women after our country has fought for years to lift up women around the world.Trump and Republicans should realize that as they continue to shrink America s role in the world, other nations will take advantage of it and increase their own prestige and power. As long as Trump and Republicans continue down this path, respect for us will plummet and our influence will wane.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,21-Feb-17
 Rick Santorum On CNN Addresses Anti-Semitism Under Trump: It’s Obama’s Fault (VIDEO),"On the same day that bomb threats were made, more than 100 headstones were damaged or toppled in a historic Jewish cemetery in University City, Mo., on Monday, in an attack reportedly carried out by an organized group. Ten Jewish community centers in at least five states in the U.S. were targeted with bomb threats on Monday. The wave of bomb threats totals 69 incidents targeting 54 JCCs in 27 states. All of this happened since Donald Trump took office. Trump has a huge neo-Nazi following, after literally being supported by every white supremacist group across the board during his campaign.But, according to what CNN contributor Rick Santorum said on Tuesday, it s former President Barack Obama s fault. CNN host Chris Cuomo asked Santorum on Tuesday why the alleged president hasn t called out the attacks on Jewish centers. While Santorum did say that Trump should tweet something about the attacks, he still defended the amateur president s silence. Let s look at the president s record and compare it with what we ve seen in the last eight years,  Santorum said.  Number one, the president has stood by Israel in ways that President Obama has not, and stood very solidly with the state of Israel. I ve got to tell you, Chris, this is why you hear about fake news,  Santorum said.  For eight years   eight years!   the Obama administration sat by and said nothing about the increasing anti-Semitism on college campuses! It s an outrage you guys are pointing to this 30 days in, and for eight years you ignored that story!  he added.In Trump s Holocaust remembrance statement last month, Trump did not even mention Jewish people. Former Clinton campaign surrogate Christine Quinn reminded Santorum of that. This is a case of bomb threats!  Quinn said.  Violence and desecrating cemeteries! I don t understand the school of thought. If you think President Obama didn t do enough then do more. This isn t about being compared to your predecessor, it s about defining yourself. And does President Trump want to be defined as someone who fights hate crimes and supports Jewish people? Santorum insisted on defending Trump by saying the former reality TV show star is  much more supportive of the state of Israel than Obama. Donald Trump s base is more pro-Israel, more pro-Jewish people than anybody,  Santorum continued.  If you talk to anybody in the pro-Israel movement, they will tell you the bedrock of that is the evangelical Christian community in this country. In fact, the folks who have been walking away are liberal Jews, who are walking away from Israel, not conservative Christians. Watch: Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton tagged Trump s @POTUS account and condemned the attacks.JCC threats, cemetery desecration & online attacks are so troubling & they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting w/ @POTUS.  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 21, 2017Santorum needs to be reminded that Barack Obama is no longer the President. #ThanksObama!Featured image via screen capture. ",News,21-Feb-17
" WATCH: CIA Operative Resigns In Disgust, Torches ‘Delusional’ Trump in EPIC Rant","The people who actually know what is at stake when it comes to national security under a Trump administration are not happy at all. That would be the likely reason for the unprecedented number of leaks coming from within the government regarding the Trump White House and the activities therein. One such person is long time CIA Operative and National Security Council Spokesman Edward Price.Price wrote an absolutely scathing indictment of Trump in the Washington Post regarding his inability to continue to work in the intelligence community with Trump as Commander-in-Chief, and even put out a video revealing what he thinks of the person currently leading the nation as well. While noting that he has been proudly serving his country for years regardless of which party controlled the White House, Price noted how Trump s issues go beyond anything he has seen before and could ever tolerate: I watched in disbelief when, during the third presidential debate, Trump casually cast doubt on the high-confidence conclusion of our 17 intelligence agencies, released that month, that Russia was behind the hacking and release of election-related emails. On the campaign trail and even as president-elect, Trump routinely referred to the flawed 2002 assessment of Iraq s weapons programs as proof that the CIA couldn t be trusted   even though the intelligence community had long ago held itself to account for those mistakes and Trump himself supported the invasion of Iraq. Price then went on to go all in on Trump s disgraceful comments in front of the CIA Memorial Wall, where he should have been there to thank the intelligence community s officers for keeping us safe, and to honor those who so bravely did in the line of duty in service to all of us. Instead, Trump relitigated his election victory, and boasted about crowd sizes and criticized the press. Price says of that event: Trump s actions in office have been even more disturbing. His visit to CIA headquarters on his first full day in office, an overture designed to repair relations, was undone by his ego and bluster. Standing in front of a memorial to the CIA s fallen officers, he seemed to be addressing the cameras and reporters in the room, rather than the agency personnel in front of them, bragging about his inauguration crowd the previous day. Whether delusional or deceitful, these were not the remarks many of my former colleagues and I wanted to hear from our new commander in chief. Finally, Price gives us the straw that really broke the camel s back for him, the way Trump elevated white supremacist Steve Bannon on the NSC:The final straw came late last month, when the White House issued a directive reorganizing the National Security Council, on whose staff I served from 2014 until earlier this year. Missing from the NSC s principals committee were the CIA director and the director of national intelligence. Added to the roster: the president s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, who cut his teeth as a media champion of white nationalism. It is great to see good patriots like Edward Price coming out so bravely and saying what needs to be said: That Trump is unfit to be president, and is making dangerous and reckless decisions as Commander-in-Chief. We can only hope that there is some mechanism in place for these good people to be able to refuse reckless orders from this clearly mentally ill narcissist who belongs in the nut house rather than in the White House.Watch Edward Price scorch Trump in absolutely epic form below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,21-Feb-17

 Mark Zuckerberg Brutally SHAMES Trump For Calling The Media America’s ‘Enemy’,"Recently, President Bannon s underling, Donald Trump, called the American news media  the enemy of the American people  in a quickly-deleted tweet.Obviously, this did not go over well, given that there are very few leaders who have classified the press as the enemy of the people and none of them were or are nice people.As most of us mock  Easy D for his transparent effort to delegitimize all but himself and his approved (friendly) news sources, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg managed to shame Trump in the most classy way possible   and he didn t even have to mention The Donald by name.On Monday, Zuckerberg posted that he and his wife Priscilla had spent their day stopping by local newspapers in Alabama where  the folks there were working hard over President s Day weekend to keep their communities informed. It seems like a good time to say thank you to all the journalists around the world who work tirelessly and sometimes put their lives in danger to surface the truth,  Zuckerberg continues.  I don t always agree with everything you say, but that s how democracy is supposed to work. In other words, he doesn t scream  FAKE NEWS  every time someone reported unflattering information about him. I know I join many people in America and across the world in thanking you for your work,  Zuckerberg confluded. He even posted a lovely photo of the two of them in front of the Selma Times-Journal.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Today Priscilla and I stopped by some local newspapers as we drove through Alabama.

 Breitbart Star Just Lost His Precious Book Deal After HORRIFYING Suggestion That Child Abuse Is Okay,"It looks like Breitbart superstar Milo Yiannopoulos  15 minutes of fame has ended after a teensy weensy little pro-pedophilia video has surfaced. We get hung up on this sort of child abuse stuff to the point where we are heavily policing consensual adults,  Yiannopoulos can be heard saying during a podcast, adding that it s normal in the  homosexual world  (it s not) for young boys and older men to have  relationships :In the homosexual world, particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men   the sort of  coming of age  relationship   those relationships in which those older men help those young boys discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable, sort of rock, where they can t speak to their parents.According to Yiannopoulos, 13-year-old boys are  sexually mature  people who can have  relationships,  which are  positive experiences,  with older men. During the interview, the Trump supporter and (until recently) CPAC headliner explained that he  is advocating  for man-on-child sex.Here is a longer cut where Milo Yiannopoulos says that he ""is advocating"" for legal sex between 13 year olds! & older men. #CPAC2017 pic.twitter.com/1fiuv7TSKs  The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) February 19, 2017Though CPAC leadership has always been perfectly fine with Yiannopoulos claiming that Donald Trump grabbing women by the pussy isn t sexual assault and all the other horrific things he says and does, the conservative icon was disinvited following  the revelations about what sort of person he is. Even the vile white supremacists at Breitbart have decided that he might have gone too far   and these are the people who worked under President Steve Bannon!But what probably hurts most about all this for Milo, who calls Donald Trump  daddy,  is that he lost his precious book deal. Publisher Simon & Schuster announced Monday that Milo s precious book isn t happening anymore: After careful consideration, Simon & Schuster and its Threshold Editions imprint have cancelled publication of  Dangerous  by Milo Yiannopoulos. He s not taking this well. after apologizing for calling the 13-year-old boys he referenced  boys  rather than  young men,  the normally boisterous right-wing figure was reduced to simple sentences whining about what  his pedophilia advocacy has cost him:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));They canceled my book.Posted by Milo Yiannopoulos on Monday, February 20, 2017 because he s the real victim here:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));I've gone through worse. This will not defeat me.Posted by Milo Yiannopoulos on Monday, February 20, 2017Milo would complain on Twitter, but he has been banned from that platform ever since he led a racist mob attack on Saturday Night Live s Leslie Jones.Sadly, he probably will get through this given the enthusiastic response from conservatives, who don t care if Milo thinks it s OK to molest children:       Sorry, Milo   the free market has spoken, and its invisible hand slapped you across the face.Featured image via screengrab",News,20-Feb-17
 Milo Might Have Gone Too Far This Time – Even For Breitbart (DETAILS),"Right-wing provocateur, Neo-Nazi, all around douchebag and Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos is finally getting his comeuppance for being a terrible human being. It seems that even the internet hellhole of misogynists, anti-Semites, racists, white supremacists, and other assorted bigots that is Breitbart has had enough of Milo since he came under fire for videos in which he openly defended pederasty. These revelations got him banned from speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), and now it seems that they may even cost him his job.The Hill is reporting that Milo s fellow employees at Breitbart are disgusted by his remarks, and a fair number of them are threatening to leave the company if Milo isn t given his walking papers. An unnamed senior editor leaked to the Washingtonian that Milo has been a problem for some time now, and that this is the straw that breaks the camel s back for  at least half a dozen  Breitbart employees: The fact of the matter is that there s been so many things that have been objectionable about Milo over the last couple of years, quite frankly. This is something far more sinister. If the company isn t willing to act, there are at least half a dozen people who are willing to walk out over it. Talking abut young boys and somehow seeking to ameliorate concerns over young boys  relationships with older men I m pretty sure everyone in the company would vomit upon hearing these words. What right-thinking person doesn t feel sick to their stomach when hearing something like that? Granted, considering the filth that is printed at Breitbart and the types of people who frequent the place, this reaction to Milo s defense of the indefensible here is hardly something that redeems them. But, at the end of the day, if Milo is shunned from polite society and has all of his platforms taken away, it s better for society as a whole. If he s too much for Breitbart, chances are he s too much for any other outlet or news network as well.UPDATE: It is also being reported that Simon & Schuster will not be publishing Milo s book, Dangerous.Simon & Schuster is canceling the publication of 'Dangerous' by Milo Yiannopoulos ""After careful consideration.""

" Mike Pence Breaks Silence, Responds To Being ‘Misled’ By Trump Team And Flynn (VIDEO)","After suffering the massively humiliating experience of being led on by the White House over former National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn, Vice President Mike Pence has finally broken his silence and shared his feelings over being made to look like a total idiot in front of America.On Monday in Brussels, Pence spoke alongside the NATO Security General, where he was asked the one question he probably didn t want to answer. The Associated Press  Ken Thomas flat-out asked Pence if he felt misled by the Trump administration over Flynn s communications with Russia, particularly after Pence viciously defended Flynn in January. Thomas asked: Do you feel like your were misled by members of the Trump administration or were you frustrated that you were left out of the loop on this situation, and what assurances have you received from President Trump that something like this will not happen again? He may be spending a lot of time with Trump, but Pence has not yet learned how to distract, lie, and bullsh*t his way out of answering questions like his boss yet. Pence gave a measured, careful response, but ultimately revealed that he had been let down. The former governor of Indiana said: Let me say I m very grateful for the close working relationship I have with the President of the United States and I would tell you that I was disappointed to learn that the facts that have been conveyed to me by General Flynn were inaccurate. Pence also addressed Flynn s resignation, where he gave another cautious response: We honor General Flynn s long service to the United States of America, and I fully support the president s decision to ask for his resignation I have great confidence in the national security team of this administration moving forward.

 CPAC Cowards Run For The Hills As Milo Pedophilia Controversy Heats Up (IMAGES),"Conservatives once again show that their sense of  morality  is really only dependent upon which way the political tide is blowing. First, they had proudly defended their decision to invite Alt-Right (read: Neo-Nazi) darling Milo Yiannopoulos to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) as a star speaker. Now, Milo has said MANY things that are reprehensible to any decent person, regardless of political leanings. He has been openly racist, misogynist, otherwise bigoted, and has just generally been an all around trolling degenerate. That was no secret. But still, he was A-OKAY with the good folks who run the right-wing s biggest event of the year.However, right-wingers are cowards. When things get too hot, they run away like cockroaches. That is what has happened now that Milo has been caught on tape advocating for and defending pederasty. Given the obvious and understandable public outcry here, the CPAC folks have dropped Milo like a hot rock. Right-wing mouthpiece and leading CPAC organizer Matt Schlap tweeted the following announcement regarding his newfound rejection of Milo:""@ACUConservative has decided to rescind the invitation of Milo Yiannopoulos to speak at #CPAC2017."" pic.twitter.com/sVWGnPCW7C  Matt Schlapp (@mschlapp) February 20, 2017Of course, Milo has put up his own super defensive Facebook post regarding the matter:This seems to be a bit too far for even some of his rabid fans, though. Here are just a few responses Milo received on that post: And that s just for starters. Unfortunately, there are a lot of blind defenders there as well, and others who are off on a tangent about how LGBTQ rights led to the sorts of views that Milo holds. Either way, Milo has gone way too far this time. The sad part is that he is now mainstream as far as conservatives go now. The Alt-Right IS the current face of the GOP under Donald Trump. It just took this revelation for the folks at CPAC to realize that   or rather, it took media attention and political pressure for them to care. Sad, but true.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,20-Feb-17
 Trump Tweets His Dumbest ‘Sweden’ Garbage Yet And Gets Torn APART By The Internet (TWEETS)," I m sorry I lied.  Those four magic words would have done a lot to prove to the American people that he is, indeed, capable of taking some small step toward redeeming himself after his administration s third fake terrorist attack. Unfortunately, this is Donald Trump we re talking about and he will not be deterred from believing whatever crazy bullshit he decides to believe at any given moment   not by facts, not by reality, and certainly not by those goddamn Swedes.Trump recently baffled the world by referencing a terrorist attack in Sweden that didn t happen after misremembering a Fox News report. Trump didn t say what happened (though we imagine the perpetrators of the Bowling Green and Atlanta massacres are behind it), but if there was a  three strikes and you re out  rule when it comes to an administration completely making up f*cking massacres Trump d be  out.  Nevertheless, he just kept banging away at Sweden on Monday morning. Give the public a break   The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully,  he tweeted, adding (because he s twelve)  NOT! Give the public a break   The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2017So, what s happening in Sweden? The Independent reports that immigration has helped ful the largest economic boon Sweden has seen in five years:The Swedish government, whose policies saw the country take in more refugees per capita than any other in Europe last year, helped lower unemployment rates by increased spending on welfare for asylum seekers from war torn countries like Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.The move helped the Nordic region s largest economy expand 4.5 percent on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of 2015, the most in almost five years and more than twice the growth of Germany, according to Bloomberg.Increased consumer spending and borrowing and high house prices also contributed to the boom which, although projected to fade, has consolidated Sweden as one of Europe s success stories.Also, a moose fell in love.Trump s decision to continue babbling about Sweden (and, of course, the L genpresse FAKE NEWS) led to widespread mockery:.@realDonaldTrump Sweden is even confused by your allegations.

 MSNBC Host Drops BOMBSHELL On Real ‘Enemy’ To America; Trump PISSED (VIDEO),"Even from the beginning of his hate-fueled, bigoted presidential campaign, it was obvious that Donald Trump did not give a damn about America and the values the country was built upon. Trump has carried this anti-American attitude straight into his failing, undeserved presidency   and yet he has the nerve to call the media the  enemy of the American people  because of unfavorable coverage.Despite how many distractions Trump tries to create to hide his failures and f*ckups, we shouldn t forget who the real threat to America is   and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough wasn t afraid to point it out. Earlier today, Scarborough called out Trump s attacks on the media, calling it the real enemy because it might encourage violence against the journalists who are reporting the truth about Trump.On Morning Joe, Scarborough echoed the comments of Republican senator John McCain, who said that Trump s attack on the media sounded like a dictator and that he had gone too far. Scarborough ripped Trump: It s one thing to say the press is liberal, it s one thing to say the 9th Circuit (Court) is liberal, but when you start saying that somebody is an enemy of the people, then that does incite people to violence   especially if it s coming from the president of the United States. Scarborough revealed that thanks to Trump, journalists are now getting death threats on a daily basis just for telling the truth about the Trump administration, putting their lives in danger. When you receive tweets every day, and somebody s threatening your life and they talk about lynching you and your family after President Trump has his way with the media, this happens over and over again, and I don t think there s anybody who s in the media that doesn t hear that every day. So yeah, this is very, very dangerous. Scarborough also nailed Trump on his  fake news  tantrums, noting the irony that Trump and his team are the most dishonest administration we ve ever seen. Most recently, Trump even made up a completely bogus terrorist attack! Scarborough said: As Jesus said, don t throw stones if you live in glass houses. This man lives in the biggest glass house there is when it comes to a disconnection from truth. So to attack the media and then say they re enemies of the people is beyond the pale. And if Trump thought that attacking the press was going to shut the media down, Scarborough gave him a brutal reality check: Let s talk about things in a way that Donald Trump can understand   ratings   and let s just put it all out on the table. Everybody s ratings are up, newspaper subscriptions at the New York Times are exploding, the Washington Post doing better than it s ever done before. CNN   from the day that Donald Trump called them fake news, CNN s numbers have exploded. Donald Trump has been Jeff Zucker s   you can tell they ve been great friends for a very long time, because there is nothing Donald Trump could do to help CNN more. They re enjoying record numbers.

 ‘Let’s Not Be Fake News’: Trump Trolled HARD By Swedish Newspaper,"Amateur president Donald Trump routinely propagates fake news while deflecting from major scandals surrounding his chaotic administration. During his ego-rally in Florida Saturday, Trump fabricated a terror attack in Sweden, which he said happened on Friday night. That, of course, never happened. Trump s lie certainly caught officials in Sweden off guard. The the Swedish embassy in Washington has asked the U.S. State Department for an explanation of Trump s claim. The Internet thoroughly mocked Trump s remarks, and considering it was the third fabricated terror attack from team Trump, it was well deserved. And now, a Swedish newspaper is trolling Trump, too.Since Trump said the attack happened  last night  in Sweden, the English-language newspaper, Aftonbladet, used those words to publish a list of what did happen  last night  in their country. The article also includes a video of Trump s remarks at the rally. On Sunday Trump clarified on Twitter that he was not referring to a specific event, but to a Fox News story broadcasted Friday evening,  the paper writes. Anyway, Mr President, here is what happened in Sweden Friday night,  it continues.The list:3:24 PM (local time): A man set himself on fire at Sergels torg, a plaza in central Stockholm. He was taken to the hospital with severe burns. There is so far no information on his motives but the intelligence service is not part of the investigation.6:42 PM: The famous singer Owe Th rnqvist had some technical problems during rehearsal for the singing competition  Melodifestivalen . (However, the 87 year old singer still managed to secure the victory the very next day.)8:23 PM: A man died in hospital, after an accident in the workplace earlier that day in the city of Bor s.8:46 PM: Due to harsh weather in the northern parts of Sweden the road E10 was closed between Katterj kk and Riksgr nsen. Due to strong winds and snow in the region the Met office also issued an avalanche warning.12:17 AM: Police officers initiated a chase for a fleeing Peugeot through central parts of the Swedish capital of Stockholm. The pursuit ended in police officers ramming the suspect at Engelbrektsgatan. The driver is now accused of driving under the influence, traffic violation and car theft.IN LIGHTER NEWS: 11:23 AM: Ok, let s not be fake news, this story took place in the autumn, but was reported Friday before lunch and we thought you would like it. A wooden moose got the attention of a lovesick moose bull. It all happened in 79 year old Ove Lindqvist s garden in Byske outside Skellefte , northern Sweden.  I thought it was going to start a fight, instead it humped the wooden moose thrice , he said.Trump was just trolled hard on   wait for it   Presidents Day.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,20-Feb-17
 Mexico Just RUINED Donald Trump’s Plans In The Best Way Possible,"Trump likes trying to bully Mexico, even claiming that he will force them to pay for his stupid wall by making the  rapists  and  drug dealers  down there pay a 20 percent tax on goods exported to the United States. Mexico has been very clear that there is no interest in engaging in Donald Trump s ridiculous plan   but the government recently sent Trump a very clear message about what he (and America) has to lose if he persists with this madness. The Globe and Mail reports that a Mexican cabinet minister has revealed Mexico s plan to stop The Donald. If you tax that $50bn [trade defecit] at 20 percent of imports   which is by the way a practice that 160 other countries do   right now our country s policy is to tax exports and let imports flow freely in, which is ridiculous. By doing it that way we can do $10bn a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone. That s really going to provide the funding,  Trump s mouthpiece Sean Spicer said in January while explaining how the wall would be funded. There is so much at stake for the interest of the U.S. as a country,  Mexico s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said in an interview, adding that the country could stop cooperating on security and intelligence, migration control, and drug enforcement: We have been a great ally to fight problems with migration, narcotics   If at some point in time things become so badly managed in the relationship, the incentives for the Mexican people to keep on co-operating in things that are at the heart of [U.S.] national-security issues will be diminished.You cannot ask me to [accept poor] conditions in terms of trade and then request my help to manage migration issues from other nations or   the prosecution of criminal activities and narcotics. Right now there are many more Mexicans coming back than there are leaving and the great challenge is the flows of every other nationality coming through Mexico,  Guajardo says, noting that Mexico detained 330,000 Central Americans in the last two years alone and would likely be very willing to stop helping in that regard if a certain orange someone gave them a reason. The Globe notes that the program  has been criticized by Mexican human rights organizations because it has little or no security benefit for Mexico, and contravenes obligations Mexico has as a signatory to international convention on the rights of migrants and refugees. Simply put, Guajardo seems to be perfectly happy to  allow the migrants to proceed north on the train and bus routes they used to take unhindered to the northern border.  In addiction, Mexico could stop allowing our agents to screen migrants, which would damage our national security. So there are many things at stake that cannot be undervalued or undermined,  Mr. Guajardo said. And that s why my President, with the principles that he gave us for these bilateral dealings, he was very clear in saying that this negotiation has to be figured out with all items considered.  He adds that Trump s rhetoric  can have a damaging consequence  and  it will be very foolish to continue. Featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla)/screengrab",News,20-Feb-17
" There WAS A Terror Attack In Sweden Recently, But Trump Won’t Like Who The Terrorists Were","Trump drew international attention again by claiming there was a terror attack in Sweden on the night of Feb. 17. To cover his gross lie, he tweeted today that his remarks were in reference to something Fox News reported, which is either just another lie, or a gross misunderstanding of a documentary Fox News aired. But it seems that there really was a terror attack in Sweden recently, in a city called Gothenburg.The suspected terrorists in this attack were Neo-Nazis, and they attacked a refugee center in Gothenburg with a homemade bomb last month. One person was seriously injured in the attack.Swedish intelligence said that the attack was linked to two others in Gothenburg, and appeared to be politically motivated, which isn t shocking if the terrorists were white Neo-Nazis, and members of a white supremacist group known as the Nordic Resistance Movement. They openly preach anti-Semitism and racism, and they oppose non-white immigration into Sweden.Hmmm. That sounds an awful lot like all the white supremacists here in the U.S. who support Trump.Sweden has taken in more refugees per capita than anyone else in Europe in 2016, despite imposing border controls in the middle of the year. What we have now, however, are white supremacists attacking a refugee center. Trump wants to blame refugees for terror attacks all across Europe, but that doesn t work when the terrorists are white Neo-Nazis.This is how this administration operates, though. Tell a lie, make a wild accusation, or say or do something equally outrageous, watch it get debunked or solidly smacked down, and then double down on it by either blaming it on faulty information or sticking by it anyway. And they won t acknowledge terror attacks that don t fit their anti-Muslim narrative.Featured image by Olivier Douliery via Getty Images",News,19-Feb-17
 That Moment Conservative Star Milo Yiannopoulos Said It’s OK For ‘Older Men’ To Have Sex With Children (VIDEO),"If you have not yet heard, alt-Right (that means Nazi) scumbag Milo Yiannopoulos will be headlining the annual Stupid People Convention (CPAC) this year. But did you know he totally thinks it s OK for grown men to f*ck kids? We get hung up on this sort of child abuse stuff to the point where we are heavily policing consensual adults,  Yiannopoulos can be heard saying in a recently-surfaced video before giving his  controversial  viewpoint that grown men having sex with middle schoolers is perfectly normal and should be accepted: In the homosexual world, particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men   the sort of  coming of age  relationship   those relationships in which those older men help those young boys discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable, sort of rock, where they can t speak to their parents. To be clear, this may be what Yiannopoulos considers normal, but it is not not in the  homosexual world  or anywhere else. It sounds like molestation to me,  an unnamed person replies.  It sounds like Catholic priest molestation to me. But you know what? I m grateful for Father Michael. I wouldn t give nearly such good head if it wasn t for him,  Yiannopoulos joked, because it s funny to joke about molesting children now, apparently. He went on to explain that such relationships are not pedophilia because 13-year-old children are  sexually mature,  adding that these  relationships  can be  hugely positive experiences  for the kids. In the interview, Yiannopoulos makes it clear that he  is advocating  for those sorts of  relationships    not just playing devil s advocate.Here s the video:But it gets creepier. In a separate interview with Joe Rogan, Milo explains that he once attended a Hollywood party where  very young boys  were kept around for sex   a party similar to the one at which Donald Trump allegedly raped a 13-year-old girl.After the audio and video surfaced, Yiannopoulos responded, claiming that it s all fake:There s a video going around that purports to show me saying anti-semitic things (nope) and advocating for pedophilia (big nope). The shocking thing? It s Republicans doing it. Sad to see establishment types collapse into the same tactics as social justice warriors: name calling, deceptively edited videos, confected moral outrage and public shaming. This is why they deserve to burn   and why they are burning. Here s how I actually feel about pedophilia, which you d know if you d actually watched or read anything I ve ever done. Or, you know, if you had two brain cells to rub together. There s only one appropriate response to this sort of behavior, and it s a gigantic F**K YOU!Suuure, Milo. Sure.

 Donald Trump Responds To Mockery Over Fake Swedish Attack – Prepare To Laugh Your A** Off,"Last night, at a rally in Melbourne, Florida, Trump was trying to build more fear of brown people in his base of loyalists by referencing a completely imaginary terror attack in Sweden. Since then, he s received an earful from the former Prime Minister of Sweden, prompted questions from confused Swedes, and social media has been abuzz with mockery of the imaginary attack, too.One would have expected Trump to respond fairly quickly, since he s now formally joined the ranks of Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer when it comes to fake terror attacks, but he didn t.

 #RESISTANCE Organizers Have An AMAZING New Anti-Trump Campaign; Trump Will Be FURIOUS (IMAGES),"If there is anything that really gets under Donald Trump s skin, it is people questioning his authority and his legitimacy as president. This is the reason that he keeps making up claims of fake voter fraud whenever anyone points out the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by close to three million. It is also why he took such exception to Saturday Night Live portraying his chief strategist, former Breitbart News head Stephen K. Bannon, as the real president.Well, that narrative has been taken to a whole other level by #RESISTANCE organizers. They, like anyone sane, realizes that Bannon has an unusual amount of power in the Trump White House. That is troubling, considering that Bannon is a white supremacist who also has said he wants to  destroy the state.  Therefore, the answer to this is to make sure that people understand that it is quite possibly Bannon, rather than Trump, calling the real shots up there in Washington.The new campaign has put signs in major cities around the nation that read,  Impeach President Bannon. Spotted in DC this morning   these are so newly posted the wheat paste is still wet. pic.twitter.com/pwTubJVFmu  Garance Franke-Ruta (@thegarance) February 19, 2017According to the people who organized the effort, their reasoning for doing so is the following: No one voted for Steve Bannon. Yet he is the de-facto 45th President of the United States. This could very well be true; after all, Trump has named Bannon to the National Security Council, all the while demoting the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence. Further, it is pretty clear to anyone watching that Bannon has quite a bit of influence over Trump   so much so that TIME Magazine actually put Bannon on the cover instead of Trump, and called him  the great manipulator. As for the goals of this campaign? Well, there are a few possibilities, according to those behind it: Maybe we ll encourage an angry tweet or two. Maybe even get Trump to say his two favorite words to Bannon,  You re Fired.  We ll tune in. It ll be great for ratings. Hopefully, Trump s ego takes over on this one, and Bannon is out the door sooner rather than later. That would definitely be a win for #THERESISTANCE.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,19-Feb-17
 Republicans Attack NASA For Trying To Save Earth Instead Of Putting Space First,"Republicans don t seem to understand that Earth is the planet we live on.Donald Trump and his Republicans supporters in Congress are taking aim at any agency that studies climate change.Climate change has had a devastating impact on our planet. The ice sheets are melting as an unprecedented rate and sea level rise threatens to drown our coastlines, which includes Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort at Palm Beach, Florida.Furthermore, weather patterns have become more unpredictable and we are seeing more instances of major disastrous hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, etc Whether Republicans like it or not, humans have been the driving force behind climate change, and it will get even worse since Trump is giving oil, gas, coal and chemical companies the freedom to pollute more than ever before. Soon, our cities will be choked by smog and our waterways will be poisoned as global temperatures continue to rise because of all the carbon we pump into the air.That s why NASA s Earth Science Division exists to track and study climate change in order to find ways to slow it down or stop it and reverse it so that future generations of the human race can continue living on the planet. After all, we only have one planet to live on.But Republicans like Rep. Lamar Smith think NASA should make space their top priority even though Earth is far more important because without it we wouldn t be alive, and thus, unable to explore the universe.Smith wants to cut Earth Science from NASA s budget in an effort to stop the science agency from studying climate change. By rebalancing, I d like for more funds to go into space exploration; we re not going to zero out earth sciences,  Smith said.  Our weather satellites have been an immense help, for example, and that s from NASA, but I d like for us to remember what our priorities are, and there are another dozen agencies that study earth science and climate change, and they can continue to do that. Meanwhile, we only have one agency that engages in space exploration, and they need every dollar they can muster for space exploration. Actually, other agencies can t continue to study climate change because Trump and his team are preventing them from doing so. That, and the fact that many of these agencies do not have the budget that NASA has to study climate change effectively pretty much means Republicans are making it their mission to gut climate change research.Before taking office, Trump demanded that the Energy Department send a list of employees and labs connected to studying climate change. And Trump s nomination of Rick Perry to head the Energy Department and anti-science Oklahoma Republican Scott Pruitt make it clear that climate change research is about to be disappeared, which is why scientists are working overtime to download all information gathered on climate change before Trump s government deletes it.Also, saving the Earth should be our top priority right now. Space can wait and NASA is already preparing to eventually send people to Mars, so it s not like NASA is incapable of doing both. But Smith wants NASA to stop studying a man-made phenomenon that will destroy us if we don t do something to stop it all because he doesn t want to anger his oil and gas industry masters.This planet is facing an impending disaster the likes of which we have never seen before. Ignoring it won t make it go away and not preparing for the effects will result in a massive loss of life and the destruction of property. And Republicans will be the ones to blame.Featured image via NASA",News,19-Feb-17
 70-Year-Old Man Reportedly Has ‘Cabin Fever’ After Only One Month On New Job,"Amateur president Donald Trump blasted rival Hillary Clinton while on the campaign trail as  low energy.  He said Clinton takes naps  and added,  No naps for Trump. I don t take naps. We don t have time!  Since that time, Trump has taken three vacations, gone an a thank you tour and on Saturday, he held a rally   less than a month after being sworn in. Trump is not handling the presidency very well. Adjusting to the most difficult job in the world hasn t been easy for the 70-year-old. This from a man who said in reference to ISIS,  I alone can fix it.  Perhaps Trump didn t really want the job. He did want adoration from his supporters, though.According to Axios  Mike Allen s latest newsletter, a Trump adviser told him that Trump is experiencing  cabin fever  in the White House.Business Insider reports:Trump is reportedly experiencing headaches and frustration that he can t spend his evenings dining at restaurants like he could around Trump Tower in his old neighborhood in New York City.Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were both far more qualified for the job but Trump supporters thought bringing in a man with zero political experience was the way to go.Instead of doing his job, Trump held a campaign-style rally in Melbourne, Florida Saturday in which he filled his speech with lie after lie. That was just after he blasted the  fake news  media. By the way, he s given press credentials to a fake news site. Whatever Trump accuses someone of, he s guilty of that same thing.During the rally, Trump tried to defend his Muslim ban by fabricating a terror attack in Sweden which never happened.Allen writes that that blunder was  partially about Trump management.  That s three fake terror attacks team Trump has used to defend his travel ban of citizens from seven predominately Muslim countries, none of which committed an act of terror on U.S. soil.Trump is to spend Sunday interviewing candidates to replace Mike Flynn, the disgraced former national security adviser who was ousted over his conversations with a Russian ambassador about lifting sanctions.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,19-Feb-17
 WATCH: Fox Host Chris Wallace Just SHREDDED Priebus’ Defense Of Trump’s ‘Enemies’ Tweet,"Reince Priebus appeared on Fox News Sunday and got his ass handed to him by Chris Wallace.On Friday, Donald Trump posted a tweet in which he referred to the media as an  enemy of the American people  just because they are reporting information provided to them by sources inside the government.Chaos and infighting have plagued Trump s administration and his inept handing of national security and his ties with Russia have caused some intelligence officials to withhold information from the White House out of fear that Russia will get it as well.Of course, Trump denies all of the reports, claiming that his administration is running smoothly and that while the leaks are real, the news about them is  fake. The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017Basically, Trump accused the media of committing treason, a step closer to arresting journalists, something Wallace informed Priebus is what dictators do. We don t have a state-run media in this country,  Wallace said.  That s what they have in dictatorships. Priebus whined that the media is using anonymous sources in their reporting, which is what journalists do to protect their sources from reprisals. If the media were to name their sources you can bet that Trump would retaliate against that person or persons who are speaking to the press. In other words, he would silence them to make sure the American people never find out what he is really doing.In his denial of the reports, Priebus hypocritically used an anonymous source to make his claim, which drew a rebuke from Wallace.Priebus then whined that the media isn t covering what Trump wants them to cover. Wallace bluntly told him that he doesn t  get to tell us what to do  and the fact is that all of the networks covered the things Priebus mentioned. Priebus and Trump are just mad because their effort to distract the media isn t working. And as a nail in Priebus s coffin, Wallace humiliated him and Trump by pointing out that while President Obama often criticized Fox News, at least he didn t do what Trump is doing. You don t get to tell us what to do any more than Barack Obama did. Barack Obama whined about Fox News all the time, but I gotta say, he never said we were an enemy of the people. Here s the video via YouTube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyipRvdPyLE&feature=youtu.beDonald Trump is the true enemy of our country. He opposes the free press and would rather the media be his propaganda machine. That s something that Putin has in Russia.This is a slippery slope towards state censorship and jailing journalists for doing their jobs. That can t be allowed to happen and that means this administration has to be put to an end before it s too late.Featured image via screenshot",News,19-Feb-17
 John McCain: Trump’s Attacks On The Press Are ‘How Dictators Get Started’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has declared the media to be  the enemy,  but John McCain has a stark warning about Trump s most recent declaration of war:  suppressing the free press  is  how dictators get started. During a Sunday morning interview on Meet the Press, the Republican senator told NBC s Chuck Todd that if we  want to preserve democracy,  then we have to have a free press. Period. I hate the press. I hate you especially,  McCain joked.  But the fact is we need you. We need a free press. We must have it. It s vital. If you want to preserve   I m very serious now   if you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and many times adversarial press,  McCain said.  And without it, I am afraid that we would lose so much of our individual liberties over time. That s how dictators get started. Trump went on a Twitter rant and attacked the free press yet again on Friday, declaring that the media  is the enemy of the American people. The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017McCain said that while becoming a dictator isn t necessarily Trump s goal, he does think we need to look at history and learn from it to avoid making the same mistakes we have made in the past. And what history shows us is that dictators  get started by suppressing free press. In other words, a consolidation of power when you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press. And I m not saying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator. I m just saying we need to learn the lessons of history. Here s the video:Featured image via video screen capture",News,19-Feb-17
 Reince Priebus Backs Trump’s Claim That The Media Is ‘The Enemy’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has declared war on the free press and his chief of staff apparently has his back. Appearing on Face the Nation this Sunday, Reince Priebus defended the tweeter in chief when it comes to his feud with the media.Trump has proclaimed the press to be  the enemy of the American people,  (through his Twitter account, of course) and Priebus thinks we should take this  seriously,  but for all the wrong reasons. CBS host John Dickerson asked Priebus about Trump naming the media the enemy in his tweet and the response he got was probably not what he was expecting. Well, I think you should take it seriously,  Priebus said.  I think that the problem we ve got is that we re talking about bogus stories like the one in the New York Times, that we ve had constant contact with Russian officials. The next day, the Wall Street Journal had a story that the intel community was not giving the president a full intelligence briefing. Both stories grossly inaccurate, overstated, overblown, and it s total garbage. The chief of staff continued, explaining that his biggest complaint about the media is their habit of protecting their sources and not outing them to the world. I think that the media should stop with this unnamed source stuff,  Priebus said.  Put names on a piece of paper and print it. If people aren t willing to put their name next to a quote, then the quote shouldn t be listed We re talking about stupidity and intelligence reporting that is based on facts that s not coming out of the actual heads of these intelligence agencies. And we re sitting here talking about it. And it s a shame. And it needs to end. Trump and his team are trying their best to convince the American people that the only place they can get the truth is from them. They are doing all they can to delegitimize the media and convince us that everything the press tells us is a lie. If the people don t trust the media, then there will be no one to bust them when the start spinning their  alternative facts  and this is precisely what the Trump administration wants.Here s the video:Featured image via video screen capture ",News,19-Feb-17
 Watergate Reporter Says Trump Is A ‘Dangerous Enemy Of The People’ Worse Than Nixon,"The Watergate scandal is considered one of the worst political scandals in American history, but Donald Trump has already done worse.Former President Richard Nixon lied to Congress and the American people repeatedly. He had an  enemies  list and tried to obstruct the investigation to cover up his involvement.Carl Bernstein is one of the reporters who broke the scandal wide open back in the 1970s. His reporting helped spur an investigation would would lead Nixon to resign rather than face being the first president ever removed from office via impeachment.And according to Bernstein, Trump is way worse than Nixon ever was.On Friday, Trump accused several media outlets of committing treason because they have relentlessly reported on Trump s chaotic administration. Thanks to leaks provided by staffers, the people know how Trump acts behind the curtain and what unconstitutional things he is planning to do.Trump, of course, hates the media for reporting the facts. So he called them  fake news  and the  enemy of the American people. The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017Trump constantly lies every time he opens his mouth and the above tweet demonstrates that he has a list of enemies like Nixon did. Trump s ties with Russia have even become a major scandal, especially since Mike Flynn resigned in disgrace after contacting Russia about sanctions prior to President Obama leaving office and lying about it. Also, Russia hacked into the DNC on Trump s behalf to help him win the election, just as Nixon had people break into DNC Headquarters in 1972.On Saturday, Bernstein made it clear that Donald Trump is more dangerous and treacherous than Nixon.The most dangerous  enemy of the people  is presidential lying always.

 Chelsea Clinton Just Lit Trump On FIRE Over His Stupid Swedish Massacre Claim (TWEETS),"The Trump administration has brought to our attention to multiple tragedies of which we were previously unaware in their effort to justify The Donald s attempt to ban Muslims from entering the country  first Kellyanne Conway s reminder of the totally real Bowling Green Massacre (her credibility was among the victims) that definitely happened, then Sean Spicer s Atlanta attack that was really real, and finally Donald Trump reminding us  what s happening last night in Sweden. Who would believe this? Sweden!  Trump told the crowd at his first campaign rally for the 2020 election (that for some reason is happening a month into his presidency).  They took in large numbers, they re having problems like they never thought possible. As it turns out, nothing actually happened in Sweden   nothing that would in any way support Trump s Muslim ban, anyway. A Swedish publication compiled a list of what went on in Sweden Friday night:So basically what s going on in Sweden right now is moose lovin . Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking?

 Trump Gives Press Credentials To A Racist Blog That LITERALLY Publishes Fake News,"Gateway Pundit is a popular publication among white supremacists, which means it will fit right in with the Trump administration. The New York Times reports that The Donald has seen fit to grant the far-right website s Washington correspondent, Lucian B. Wintrich, press credentials, allowing him to attend White House press briefings and ask Sean Spicer questions.If Gateway Pundit sounds familiar to you, that s because the site s founder, Jim Hoft, was the source of the lie that Michael Brown fractured Officer Darren Wilson s eye socket before the Ferguson cop gunned him down in the street. Hoft claimed a stock photo of an x-ray (he removed citations from the bottom of the photo) was of Darren Wilson s alleged  orbital blowout fracture.  This literal fake news, as opposed to Trump s  fake news,  was repeated by Fox News and other right-wing sources. In reality, the officer was diagnosed with a small bruise.In November, Hoft claimed that Michelle Obama had deleted Hillary Clinton from her Twitter history all the way back to 2013. This story was repeated without fact-checking by Fox s Sean Hannity, but both were ultimately revealed to be shameless liars.Correction. Live on radio I read a gateway pundit report that @MichelleObama had deleted mentions of HRC. And a listener said BHO and  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 1, 2016Elizabeth Warren did same. Fact is they didn't. I humbly apologize. Live radio  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 1, 2016He sources 4Chan, for f*ck s sake:Most recently, Hoft falsely accused Washington Post editor Doris Truong of taking pictures of Rex Tillerson s notes. He has also claimed a photo of a NBA parade was a Trump rally, and helped fuel Trump s  paid protesters  lies with a fake story about a bus full of them traveling from Trump rally to Trump rally.Hoft and his cronies may be liars, but they have been staunchly pro-fascism as long as they have existed and they love him, so let them in! It s not like they re those  fake news  purveyors at CNN, after all.Trump has as of late been favoring  friendly  news sources, and it is likely that he will continue to do so   especially when he is filling the press pen with people who are willing to lie for him.featured image via Getty Images/Sean Rayford",News,19-Feb-17
 Former Swedish Prime Minister BRUTALLY Mocks Trump’s Rally Insanity; It’s GLORIOUS (TWEET),"Donald Trump s buffonery, lies, and unhinged antics are not playing well on the world stage. The latest embarrassment to Americans from Trump comes via his weirdly timed campaign rally, held this weekend in Florida. During the rally, Trump attacked the media as  fake  like he always does, and, of course made up lots of ludicrous and bizarre lies.One such lie was designed to defend the Muslim ban, and he used a made-up terror attack in Sweden to do so. Trump told his crowd of brainwashed fans: When you look at what s happening in Germany, when you look at what s happening last night in Sweden   Sweden! Who would believe this? Sweden! They took in large numbers, they re having problems like they never thought possible. Trump s lie did not go unnoticed by former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt. Bildt took to Twitter to mock Trump s delusional statement, saying: Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound. Here is the tweet:Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound. https://t.co/XWgw8Fz7tj  Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) February 19, 2017Bildt would not be the first to question Trump s mental state. Whether he is high or not is a mystery; all we do know is that any normal person watching the train wreck that is Trump s first month in office knows that something isn t right upstairs with this guy. Bildt wasn t finished with Trump with just that one tweet, though. He went on to tweet a mocking photo of a muppet  Swedish Chef  who Bildt says is  sought for the attack,  complete with butcher knives.Donald Trump has only been in office for one month, and already his behavior is making America a laughingstock.

" Trump Put Out A Survey On The Media, And What Happened Is So Hilarious He’s Now Crying ‘RIGGED!’","Trump and his staff are so sure the media lies about everything that they ve put together a  media accountability survey  designed to gauge how people feel about the media, how they re representing Trump and Republicans, and numerous other things. Of course, because true scientific polls don t ever tell them what they want, this survey is anything but scientific. They want to feed their confirmation bias. But what s really happening is hilarious and it s made Trump call his own poll rigged.Seriously.The email that was sent to supporters asking them to take the survey again reads:The President emailed you to take the urgent Mainstream Media Accountability Survey.Since then, mainstream media outlets have viciously attacked it and thousands of Democrats have taken it to try to sabotage the results.Which is why we need your IMMEDIATE help as one of President Trump s biggest supporters.Please take the Mainstream Media Accountability Survey now.>>Thanks,Team Trump Not only does this email demonstrate that Trump is only interested in answers from people who think the exact same way he does, but it also demonstrates the sheer desperation on Trump s part to prove that the media is engaging in one giant conspiracy to bring him down. Or something.The questions in the survey are leading and biased, and were definitely not crafted by an experienced pollster. He wants specific answers and the questions are worded so he s more likely to get those answers:    And those are just a sampling of the questions in the survey.At the end, it asks you for your name, email address and zip code, but there s no verification on it, so you can make up a name and email address, and pick a zip code. Any zip code. And you don t have to create dummy email accounts for it either   so really, what did they expect to happen here?After you fill it out it takes you to a donation page, because of course it does.The bottom line is that, unless he gets the results he s looking for, he s going to keep crying  rigged! If you d like to see what s in it, it can be found here, if you d like to take it for yourself. Repeatedly.Featured image by Sean Rayford via Getty Images",News,19-Feb-17
 Trump Talks About Terror Attacks That Happened Overseas Last Night – There’s Just One LITTLE Problem,"Everyone remembers who died at Bowling Green thanks to Kellyanne Conway. Everyone remembers who died in Atlanta thanks to Sean Spicer. And the truth is that those of us who didn t die at Bowling Green died in Atlanta. Or did we? Donald Trump held a rally in Florida today, where he discussed, or rather, fear-mongered, about terrorism, and referenced yet another completely imaginary terror attack. This one happened last night in Sweden, supposedly, and it s fairly safe to assume we all died there, too. You look at what s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden! Who would believe this? Sweden! They took in large numbers, they re having problems like they never thought possible. The thing is, there were no terror attacks in Sweden last night. There was an incident at the Turkish embassy in Sweden on the 15th, but that was specifically against Turkey, possibly by supporters of an organization that has been operating mainly in Turkey for the last 30 years. And Turkish establishments in Sweden have been having problems like this for years, which makes it unlikely that these people were refugees. But refugees are what Trump was trying to scare his crowd over with this new fake attack: We ve allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country, and there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation, there was no nothing. BULL. SHIT. The vetting process has been explained so many times by so many people now that it s a wonder anybody at all can still lap this liquid baloney up the way they do.Finding news about any terror attacks anywhere on the European continent last night is difficult. In fact, news about terror attacks last night is coming mostly from India and Pakistan. Most of that news seems to speculate whether India is behind terror attacks in Pakistan.There are a few stories about terrorism in Israel. But pretty much nothing from Europe, and certainly nothing from Scandinavia. Yet Trump went on and on about how we have no way of knowing who s coming into the country by claiming that Sweden is having problems they ve never had before. It s a truly dark time when someone who calls himself President of the United States has to lie in order to spread the proper amount of fear.And truth be told, fear-mongering is bad enough. What Trump is doing is a squillion times worse. Watch his gullible, worshiping audience eat this lie up below:Featured image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images",News,18-Feb-17
 Snowflake Trump Kicks Off Campaign Rally By Attacking The ‘Fake News’ Media,"America s so-called president held a rally in Melbourne, Florida, after just a few weeks into the job. Donald Trump spoke of the mess he has inherited (LOL) and of course, he lashed out at the media. This was Donald s campaign rally for 2020 and he s already been on vacation three times since taking the oath of office. His guest speakers were laughable, with one saying he s kept all of his campaign promises, including  draining the swamp. Trump promised to achieve his agenda despite the  lies, misrepresentations and false stories  thrown at him by the media. He said that without offering proof and the crowd ate it up. I want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news,  Trump said. The crowd, of course, erupted in cheers. The dishonest media, which has published one false story after another with no sources, even though they pretend they have them they make them up in many cases,  the scandal-plagued amateur president said.  They just don t want to report the truth. Many of our greatest presidents fought with the media and called them out,  Trump said while mentioning Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln, according to The Hill. When the media lies to people, I will never, ever, let them get away with it. I will do whatever I can that they don t get away with it,  Trump said.  They have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda. But despite all their lies, misrepresentations and false stories they could not defeat us in the primaries or general election and we ll continue to expose them as what they are and most importantly we ll continue to win, win, win,  Trump continued. Do you think that one media group back there, that one network, will show this crowd? Not one, not one,  Trump declared. Meanwhile, at that very moment, CNN was panning the crowd. I ve ordered the construction of a Great Border Wall that will start very shortly,  Trump said at the adulation rally. The problem is, though, that Trump did not tell his supporters that we, the taxpayers, will be footing the bill, not Mexico. We are going to drain the swamp in Washington, DC,  he said. The crowd chanted  Drain the swamp, Drain the swamp!  Trump s gullible supporters did this after he already filled the swamp up with terrifying creatures.On Air Force One, Trump told reporters,  Life is a campaign. Making our country great again is a campaign. For me, it s a campaign. To make America great again is absolutely a campaign. It s not easy, especially when we re also fighting the press. According to the Melbourne Police, 9,000 people attended the campaign rally for the man who has already been elected.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News,18-Feb-17
 Trump Just Got DESTROYED By J.K. Rowling For His Attack On The Free Press – Here’s How (TWEET),"Donald Trump topped off his disastrous press conference on Thursday by calling the press  the enemy of the American people  on Friday, and is thankfully getting all the criticism and backlash he deserves.One of Trump s harshest and most outspoken critics, author J.K. Rowling, slammed Trump s comments about the press without even using any of her own words. Brilliantly quoting former President Theodore Roosevelt, Rowling tweeted to educate Trump on just how the free press worked, in case dictator Trump and the GOP forgot. In the tweet, Rowling pointed out that Roosevelt had written: To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President right or wrong is morally treasonable to the American public. Rowling even used the trending #NotTheEnemy hashtag to show her support for the press. Check out the full tweet below:Exactly. The free press is protected by the U.S. Constitution, a document that Trump desperately needs to read before he does or says something else that will make him look foolish. In his attacks on the media, it s clear that Trump wants  unquestioned,  unchecked and unlimited power   and doesn t care if it interferes with the very values that this country was built on. Trump wants to operate as if his word is law and that his alternative facts are the only truth Americans should be digesting without a second thought.Trump seems to be oblivious to the real responsibilities of the job he signed up for, as well as the fact the he actually works for the American people   not the other way around. What Rowling did perfectly put Trump in his place and reminded the undeserving POTUS just exactly how a democracy is supposed to work.Featured image via Ben A.

" Don Lemon Is Fed Up, Yanks Guest Off The Air After Idiotic Fake News Claims (VIDEO)","CNN host Don Lemon has had it with conservatives who claim things are  fake news  just because they disagree. He got that point across loud and clear when he suddenly cut a segment short rather than let a guest continue to argue that the network is pushing  fake news  stories.Lemon was moderating a panel discussion regarding the expense of Trump s weekend trips to his Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida. But when Paris Dennard, a political analyst and commentator, finally got a chance to give his opinion things went completely off the rails. Dennard declared that the entire topic they were discussing was  fake news. The president is not breaking any laws, and he s not doing anything,  Dennard said.But Lemon wasn t having it. The CNN host cut Dennard off and decided to educate him and the viewers at home about just what the term  fake news  actually means. Fake news is when you put out a story to intentionally deceive someone and you know that it is wrong,  he said. This story that we re doing right now is not to intentionally deceive anyone. We are simply talking about the cost to keep a president safe,  he continued. Please stop it with that stupid talking point, that it is a fake news story. If you don t want to participate in the news stories on this network, then don t come on and participate. But don t call them fake because you don t agree with them. Go on. Dennard was given another chance to speak, but he still insisted that  this is a fake news story.  And at that point, Lemon had had enough and yanked Dennard off the air, abruptly ending the segment rather than let Dennard continue to undermine the press with his bogus claims.Watch the segment below: Featured image via video screen capture",News,18-Feb-17
 John McCain: Russian Election Meddling Is Even More Serious Than A Physical Attack,"Sen. John McCain is weighing in on Russia s meddling in the U.S. election, and he has made his stance abundantly clear. In an interview with New York Magazine that was published online this Saturday, McCain said that Russian interference in our presidential election is even worse  than a physical attack  and risks undermining  the foundation of democracy. The severity of this issue, the gravity of it, is so consequential because if you succeed in corrupting an election, then you ve destroyed the foundation of democracy,  McCain said.  So I view it with the utmost seriousness. I view it more seriously than a physical attack. I view it more seriously than Orlando, or San Bernardino. As tragic as that was, the far-reaching consequences of an election hack are certainly far in excess of a single terrorist attack. The senator also has some serious questions about Trump s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who has now resigned as a result of his compromising conversations with Russia. The Flynn fiasco, he said, is just another sign of dysfunction  within Trump s administration. When did Flynn know about anything to do with Russian interference?  he asked.  Why was there a gap of X number of days between the president being told and no action taken? What is the extent of the relationship between Flynn and the Russians? McCain also addressed the Russian dossier, which revealed Trump s shady ties to Russia along with insight into his personal perversions. According to the document, Russia is using Trump s sexual indiscretions to blackmail him. The Arizona senator said that this would not be out of character for Russia because it s what they do. I didn t know what to make of it, but everyone knows the Russians do use women and sex when people go to Russia,  he said.  It s an old KGB honeypot.

" Dem. Rep. Says Steve Bannon Is A ‘Stone Cold Racist,’ Has No Business Meeting With Black Caucus","Congressman Hakeem Jeffries says that, while he would welcome an opportunity for Donald Trump to sit down with the Congressional Black Caucus, he does not think Steve Bannon should be present. Why? Because of the obvious: He s a  stone cold racist. During an interview with MSNBC on Friday, Jeffries told Katy Tur that the CBC has reached out to Trump about meeting with him. Actually, they did so on January 19, the day before he was sworn into office. They would like nothing more than for him to prove that his commitment to working with minority communities is real.However, Jeffries did say that Trump s reaction to a black reporter who asked him about meeting with the CBC during a press conference was  strange.  (For the record, that isn t the word I would use. But I digress.) Regardless, Jeffries said, the CBC is still  looking forward to an open dialogue. But that feeling does not extend to Bannon, Trump s white supremacist adviser. Steve Bannon should not be in the room  He s a stone cold racist and a white supremacist sympathizer. It would be hard for me to participate in any meeting with Steve Bannon that normalizes his presence in the White House. Beyond that, we ll have to see. Jeffries and the CBC are hoping that they can work with Trump to address issues facing black America, but working with a white supremacist is just asking too much.Watch the interview here, via MSNBC:Featured image via video screen capture",News,18-Feb-17
 Kellyanne Conway Lashes Out After Alma Mater Blasts Her For Being A Liar,"Kellyanne Conway, who serves as a senior adviser to Donald Trump, is a connoisseur of  alternative facts.  In other words, she lies so much she even believes herself. But don t call her a liar, or she ll freak out. Conway is on the offensive today after the president of her alma mater called her out for repeatedly trying to sell falsehoods to the American people as truth.Trinity Washington University President Patricia McGuire blasted Conway for her lies in a blog titled On lies and the truth we must tell.  She said Conway was  part of a team that thinks nothing of shaping and spreading a skein of lies as a means to secure power. Presidential Counselor Kellyanne Conway, Trinity Class of 1989, has played a large role in facilitating the manipulation of facts and encouraging the grave injustice being perpetrated by the Trump Administration s war on immigrants among many other issues. She is one of President Trump s primary spokespersons, an almost daily figure on cable news shows,  McGuire wrote.   Some people admire her staunch advocacy for her client s positions, and others applaud the fact that she was the first woman to manage a successful presidential campaign. But in fact, as is true of many of President Trump s statements, her advocacy on his behalf is often at variance with the truth. Ms. Conway invented the now-infamous phrase  alternative fact,  to defend Trump s claims about the size of crowds at his inauguration, a thinly-veiled autocratic scheme to try to claim that the Trump inauguration drew the biggest crowd in history when, in fact, it was on the smaller side,  she continued.  Ms. Conway has been part of a team that thinks nothing of shaping and spreading a skein of lies as a means to secure power. Perhaps the  Bowling Green Massacre  comment was truly a mistake, as she claims, but she repeated that canard on three different occasions as an explanation for why the travel ban, an executive order that clearly discriminates against Muslims, was necessary. When the Washington Post informed Conway of McGuire s comments, she didn t take it well at all. True to form, she lashed out and slammed not only McGuire s wise words, but also her fellow alumni. Because why not? It s a disappointment to have the president of the university lift up other Trinity graduates who have a casual relationship with the truth,  Conway said. She then whined that McGuire didn t even have  the courtesy of calling or emailing me to ask what I meant on any given occasion. Without addressing the fact that she has been running around making up the truth as she goes along, including the Bowling Green massacre that never happened, Conway added that she has given the school lots of money over the years. My money was good,  she noted. Apparently, writing a check means that no one is allowed to call you out for spouting lies to defend a demagogue. Sounds totally legit.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,18-Feb-17
 Trump Will Spend More Taxpayer Money On Vacations In A Year Than Obama Did In Eight,"If Donald Trump continues to travel to Mar-a-Lago in Florida at the current pace, he ll spend more taxpayer dollars on vacations than President Obama ever did.Throughout President Obama s eight years in office, conservatives constantly complained every time he went on vacation or played golf. They whined that it was a waste of money and that Obama was lazy.In total, President Obama took 28 vacations spanning 217 days, which cost a total of $90 million.It should be noted that despite conservative bitching, President Obama took less vacation days than his Republican predecessor. George W. Bush took 88 vacations spanning over 500 days.And Donald Trump is going to surpass both of them very quickly.Only days after the election, Trump indicated that he intends to spend most of his weekends at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida where he also has a golf course. He also wants to spend lots of time at Trump Tower in New York and his golf course in New Jersey.Trump has already taken three trips to Mar-a-Lago since taking office four weeks ago and those three trips alone cost taxpayers $10 million.Assuming that Trump keeps up this routine and pace, he will end up taking 39 trips to Mar-a-Lago in 2017 at a whopping cost of $130 million to taxpayers, which means Trump will outspend President Obama within a single year. Furthermore, Trump would easily surpass Obama s number of vacation days. At the current pace, he would end up taking 320 vacations days in four years, and that s not counting other vacations Trump may end up taking. If he starts going to Florida every weekend he would surpass 400 days. And if he plays golf every time he goes to Mar-a-Lago he will have played more rounds of golf in two years than than President Obama did during his first term.If Trump does this every year, the cost to taxpayers will be a monstrous $520 million after four years. That s right, over half a billion dollars.Trump supporters and conservatives will argue that Trump is working during his vacations, but President Obama worked during his vacations, too, yet conservatives never stopped whining about his vacations.And just because Trump might be working a little during his vacations, it doesn t justify the cost to taxpayers. And with all the chaos Trump is causing across the nation and around the world, he shouldn t be going on vacation at all right now.Russia is getting more aggressive. North Korea is firing missiles. America is on course for a major confrontation with China. Millions of Americans are about to lose their healthcare. Immigrants are being rounded up. And America s creditors are dumping us because Trump has made investment here too much of a risk. Chaos and infighting plague the White House. Yet Trump is going on lavish vacations to his Florida estate on the taxpayer s dime while he makes everyone else suffer.It s outrageous and conservatives are hypocrites if they defend Trump.Featured image via Ian MacNicol/Getty Images",News,18-Feb-17
 Trump BUSTED Inviting Rich Friends To Sit In On Interviews For ‘Dictators’ In His Cabinet (AUDIO),"As Trump began preparations to interview for cabinet positions, he decided it was a good idea to ask his rich friends to sit in on the interviews so he could get their opinions. In audio released by Politico Saturday, The Donald can be heard telling a crowd at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club: We re doing a lot of interviews tomorrow   generals, dictators, we have everything. You may wanna come around. It ll be fun. We re really working tomorrow. We have meetings every 15, 20 minutes with different people that will form our government,  Trump added. We re going to be interviewing everybody   Treasury, we re going to be interviewing Secretary of State. We have everybody coming in   if you want to come around, it s going to be unbelievable .so you might want to come along. If it sounds to you like Trump was giving his paying club members special access to the  different people that will form our government,  you are correct in that assessment. This is particularly troubling for President Asterisk, who recently was photographed reviewing secure North Korea documents during dinner at his Florida home as white supremacists on his staff held cell phone flashlights so he could see   all while surrounded by his rich friends. So, this is my real group,  Trump tells his crowd of elite pals.  These are the people that came here in the beginning, when nobody knew what this monster was gonna turn out to be, right?

 WATCH: Larry Wilmore Takes Right-Wing Hate-Monger Milo Yiannopoulos To The Woodshed,"This is exactly what Bill Maher had in mind when he invited Milo Yiannopoulos to come on his show.In response to Yiannopoulos being unable to speak at UC Berkeley earlier this year because protesters refused to let him spew his hate on their campus, Maher decided to bring on Real Time. After scheduled panelist Jeremy Scahill dropped out in protest, Maher blasted the decision. Liberals will continue to lose elections as long as they follow the example of people like Mr. Scahill whose views veer into fantasy and away from bedrock liberal principles like equality of women, respect for minorities, separation of religion and state, and free speech,  Maher said in a statement.  If Mr. Yiannopoulos is indeed the monster Scahill claims   and he might be   nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on Friday night. And expose him he certainly did.Yiannopoulos attacked transgender people during the show which drew condemnation from the audience and a beat down from Larry Wilmore. I think it s just sad because these are the same arguments that were used against gay people, like they were aliens who just wanted to f*ck anything that moved, and that s why we should avoid them,  Wilmore said.Yiannopoulos tried to interrupt but Wilmore would have none of it and continued schooling the alt-right hate-monger. There is a difference without a distinction. It s like when people try and compare gay and black. Yeah, they re not the same thing, but we share the same invisibility. People didn t see us in society, and gay people hid out from society. But there are a lot of the same issues that you have to deal with when you re marginalized. Proving that he lost the argument, Yiannopoulos went on to insult Wilmore by telling Maher he should book guests with  high IQs.  This coming from a college dropout who makes his money by spewing sexism and anti-gay rhetoric despite being raised by his mother and grandmother and being gay himself.Well, Wilmore didn t let Yiannopoulos get away with it. Hold on, Bill. First of all, you can go f*ck yourself. If your argument is that these people are stupid, you didn t hear a word this man said,  Wilmore fired back in reference to Malcolm Nance, an intelligence analyst who worked in Naval Cryptology.  Because he can talk circles around your pathetic douchey little ass. Here s the video via YouTube:Milo Yiannopoulos fell flat on his face and demonstrated why he shouldn t be be booked to speak anywhere ever again.Featured image via screenshot",News,18-Feb-17
" The Internet HILARIOUSLY Mocks Trump With #TinyTrump Memes, Trump Hissy Fit In 3..2..1..

 Maher EVISCERATES Trump’s Insane Presser; Gets Real About How Dangerous He Is (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is dangerous as president. Anyone who has been watching this trainwreck first in campaign mode, and then during transition, and now during the actual presidency, knows this. Unfortunately, the Republicans in Washington who are in a position to actually do something seem to be completely ignoring the fact that Trump is completely out of his mind, has shown himself to be a dangerous authoritarian, and, most troubling of all, seems to have some very scary ties to Russia and its autocratic leader, Vladimir Putin.Well, there is one person on television who isn t going to mince words when it comes to Trump: Bill Maher, host of HBO s Real Time. On Friday night, Maher really let Trump have it. He lit into the disastrous insanity that was Trump s first solo press conference as president, and then went on to blatantly call Trump a nutcase. He even said that in some ways, Trump is actually WORSE than German dictator Adolf Hitler: You know your Facebook friend who said he thought Trump was Hitler? He was optimistic. What we have here is a mental patient who thinks he s Hitler. The kid in the YouTube video who is high from the dentist made more sense. Maher then went on to remind his audience not to get distracted by smaller outrages so that we take our eyes off the really dangerous happenings within the Trump White House, and indeed, with Trump himself: While you re watching the clown screw the pony, they re breaking into your car.

" Chuck Todd Confronts Trump Over UNHINGED ‘Enemy’ Tweet, Promptly Puts Him In His Place (VIDEO)","As if Donald Trump s disastrous press conference on Thursday wasn t enough to mark the closing of his first historically unpopular month in the White House, the moronic man-baby just had to continue his crusade to dismantle the U.S. Constitution into Friday.On Friday afternoon, Trump kicked off the weekend by attacking the  FAKE NEWS  media (naming a few networks in particular) and stating that America s free press (protected under the Constitution)  is the enemy of the American people.  Trump had already gone too far in his insanity-filled press conference, and this tweet definitely solidified any suspicions that he s deranged, batsh*t crazy and not even connected to reality anymore.Trump s tweet deserves all the backlash in the world, and fortunately America is responding. Trump s disgusting, anti-American Twitter tantrum has been bashed by everyday citizens and journalists alike, with several prominent media members adding their voices to the opposition and resistance to this erratic dictator.On Friday s MTP Daily, host Chuck Todd reacted to Trump s tweet and brilliantly nailed him for it. He opened the segment by stating: I don t believe any American is the enemy of any other American. For several minutes, Todd eviscerated Trump for treating his presidency like a circus and for trying to create distrust of the media. In his rant, Todd stated that many of the uncomfortable issues facing this president  are being lost in the distractions he creates. Todd then listed these issues one by one, passionately stating that the president s problems aren t a media fabrication .Taking a big swipe at Trump s belligerent behavior and his incompetent team (which has recently had some VERY serious issues of its own), Todd opened the discussion to his panel and quipped, Press Secretary Donald Trump did his job, didn t he?

" This Latest President Obama Accolade Will Enrage Trump, Who Is Only Getting More Unpopular","As Donald Trump desperately continues trying to convince everyone that he has great leadership skills, President Obama just scored a major ranking by historians.After eight years of dealing with uncooperative Republicans who tried to obstruct him at every turn, and STILL managing to give healthcare to 30 million Americans while improving American prestige around the globe, reducing Iran s stockpile of nuclear material, and relentlessly pursuing equal rights, President Obama has been ranked 12th in leadership among all presidents in history. George Washington, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Theodore Roosevelt retain their top five status, while Dwight Eisenhower moves into the top five for the first time,  according to the press release.  Former President Barack Obama enters the ranks for the first time in the number 12 position. Notably, his leadership category ratings range from number 3 for  Pursued Equal Justice for All,  to number 39 for  Relations with Congress. Historian Douglas Brinkley praised Obama s ranking as  impressive  considering this is the first time he was even eligible to be ranked.This news comes as Trump s approval rating has imploded and currently stands at 38 percent amid chaos and infighting in the White House. Whereas President Obama governed with a calm mind and steady hand, Trump has tried to govern through bullying and misinformation while being too thin-skinned to handle even the smallest criticism.Foreign nations like Russia and China are taking advantage of Trump, or challenging him and his domestic agenda which has been nothing but a disaster.In fact, Trump is so bad that historians actually ranked George W. Bush higher on the list than he was last year. George W. Bush, has benefited somewhat from the passing of years: His ranking at number 33, is up three places from our 2009 survey,  the press release continued.Indeed, Trump is so bad that many Americans actually miss Bush now.This is a major achievement for President Obama, who has spent his post-presidency living it up while Trump is busy putting out one fire after another and embarrassing himself on a daily basis. It s more than clear that President Obama was a real leader. Trump, on the other hand, will probably go down as the most inept and worst president in American history.Now we wait for Trump to throw a hissy fit.Featured image by Pete Souza/White House",News,17-Feb-17
 Angry Caller LOSES IT When Asked To Prove Media Lies About Trump – The End Is PRICELESS (VIDEO),"People who parrot and spread Trump s claims that the media lies absolutely cannot stand it when they re asked to provide examples. They try and deflect, just like Trump, except not all of them seem to be as skilled at twisting things around as Trump tries to be (and Trump himself becomes completely unhinged when someone in the media fact-checks him while talking to him). One caller into a British show ranted and raved about how the media has been twisting all these leaks coming from the White House, and the host, James O Brien, kept asking him for just one example of this.The caller became increasingly agitated at that, because apparently one shouldn t have to have evidence and examples to make a claim like that. O Brien first wanted to know how the leaks out of the White House could be real, but the news reporting the leaks was fake. The caller said: What he s trying to say to say is the media twist the leaks. If they ve just got one paragraph of the truth, they ll add another paragraph that s fake. When O Brien began pressing him harder for an example, he turned all Trumpian, saying he distrusts, and even hates, the media, but never answering O Brien s questions. The ending has quite the kicker, though, and the caller s last words are just laughable. Watch below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,17-Feb-17
 Trump Just Accused The Media Of Committing TREASON For Not Saying Nice Things About Him (TWEETS),"Donald Trump is literally inching dangerously close towards arresting members of the free press for doing their jobs.During his insanely embarrassing rant at his solo press conference on Thursday, Trump repeatedly whined about the media and called them  fake news.  He demanded that the media always take him at his word because only he knows the truth.Of course, the media does not negotiate with mad dictators and they refused to comply with Trump s demand that they bow down and kiss his ass like Fox News and Breitbart have done. So Trump lashed out at the media on Friday by calling them the  enemy of the American people    an accusation that he soon deleted so he could reword it and add more media outlets.Huffington Post contributor Eliot Nelson caught the tweet before Trump could scrub it.By the transitive property I m pretty sure the president of the United States just accused us of treason. pic.twitter.com/5N0ObYd7y5  Eliot Nelson (@eliotnelson) February 17, 2017It should be noted that by scrubbing the original tweet, Trump is violating the Presidential Records Act which prohibits the destruction of presidential records and correspondence.Trump then posted it again with changes.The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!  Donald J.

Accusing the media of treason for telling the truth is what tyrants do before they start having them arrested. The media is not the president s personal propaganda machine. The media exists to inform the American people and serves as a check on the government.

" JUST IN: Trump Knew About Flynn’s Calls With Russian Ambassador, Tried To Cover It Up","Alleged president Donald Trump is plagued with scandals after being on the job for just a few weeks. The amateur president frequently calls networks critical of his actions  fake news  while being supportive of Fox News. Well the story unfolding right now about Trump and his disgraced former national security adviser is from Fox News.According to what a source told the network, Trump was given a comprehensive summary of the contents of Michael Flynn s phone calls with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak prior to Flynn s resignation.The summary of the transcript was delivered by people outside the White House.According what what Trump said recently, Flynn did nothing wrong. But previously, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that there was an erosion of trust with Flynn after the revelations of his talks to the ambassador about sanctions. To be clear, this means that Flynn lied to Mike Pence. Trump pretty much fired Flynn, but at the bizarre news conference Thursday, the Liar-In-Chief said, Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts   I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn t doing it. I didn t direct him, but I would have directed him because that s his job,  he added. What Trump is saying is that he would have directed Flynn to take those actions while Obama was still in office. Trump referred to Flynn as a  wonderful  man after his resignation knowing full well what took place.Last month, Flynn denied in an FBI interview that he discussed sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador. That was a lie. By the way, it s a felony to lie to the FBI. Flynn led  Lock her up!  chants at a Trump rally during the campaign saying that if he did 1/10th of what Hillary Clinton did, he d be in prison. Off you go, Flynn!Let s let Seth Abrahamson break this down for us.BREAKING: Fox News is reporting Trump was fully briefed on the Flynn call with Russia after it happened and allowed Pence to be lied to.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) February 17, 2017BREAKING: Per FNC we know Trump either ordered the illegal Flynn call & tried to cover it up or just tried to cover it up. One or the other.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) February 17, 2017Man, if only we had some historical precedent for what happens to a president when he is caught trying to cover up a crime.  Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) February 17, 2017Trump needs to release his taxes so we can see if he s beholden to Russia. To reiterate, Trump knew about the calls and allowed his vice-president to be lied to. Go on, Mr. Trump, call Fox News  fake news  now.

 Breitbart Attacked Jake Tapper And His Hilarious Response Shut Them Up (TWEETS),"CNN host Jake Tapper put Breitbart in their place on Friday after they attacked him on Twitter.The white nationalist-supported website that spews  alternative facts  on a daily basis dared to attack Tapper because they think they made him change his coverage of Donald Trump.After Trump s disastrously embarrassing press conference on Thursday, Tapper told Trump to start acting like a legitimate president and  stop whining. Everybody at home needs to ask themselves how would you react if that were your boss coming in and giving a speech to the employees,  Tapper said.  How would you react if that was somebody in your family that you were trying to have a conversation with? You would think this is very difficult to assess in a positive way. The person is not dealing with the world in which we live. He said things that weren t true President Trump, if you re watching, you legitimately won the presidency. Now get to work, and stop whining about it. Breitbart appears to think they forced Tapper to call Trump  legitimate  even though Tapper has never referred to Trump as illegitimate.When you make Jake Tapper drop the  Russkies hacked the election  meme. #4DChess https://t.co/7EG12f8CkT  Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 17, 2017But they clearly messed with the wrong news anchor because Tapper fired back and hit Breitbart where it hurts the most.@BreitbartNews Such a good doggy.

 WATCH: Morning Joe Hosts Wipe The Floor With Trump’s Chaotic Lie-Infested Press Conference,"It s safe to say that Donald Trump and Joe Scarborough are no longer buddies.After an embarrassing first solo press conference in which Trump repeatedly lied and called the media  fake news  while bragging about himself and claiming that his administration is a well-oiled machine, Joe Scarborough was gauging what his Republican lawmaker friends were thinking and they are starting to understand why millions of Americans are frightened.Mika Brzezinski reacted to Trump s words by saying  And the public doesn t believe US anymore? Scarborough lambasted the entire conference, telling the Morning Joe panel on Friday that it  would have been a really funny hour or so of television if he weren t President of the United States. It was one of the most chaotic, rambling press conferences anybody has ever seen,  he continued.Indeed, Saturday Night Live has their work cut out for them if they plan to spoof Trump s conference this weekend. Because they could literally just play the real conference and take the night off.Scarborough has also seen a lot of presidential press conferences, both as part of the media and a former lawmaker. When he says this is the  most chaotic, rambling press conference,  he s not kidding.Scarborough then noted that Trump s hardcore supporters are going to support him no matter what.Panelist Mike Barnicle then chimed in that Trump has lost touch with reality. Yesterday, the first 35 minutes of that press conference was watching a President of the United States who has lost a grip on reality. It was as if he performed for himself because he needed to perform like that because he needed to convince himself he was president. Indeed, Trump spent minutes talking about his Electoral College win as if it was the greatest win in history in an apparent effort to convince everyone of his legitimacy. Except that it wasn t as  yuuuge  as Trump says because his win ranks as one of the smallest on record and he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. Trump was even called out by NBC reporter Peter Alexander over the lie. He says things that are verifiably false,  Scarborough said before adding,  Everybody I talked to on the hill, including a lot of Republican senators and congressmen, were scared to death by what they saw. And more than one said,  This just isn t going to last long because he just doesn t have control of reality. The Morning Joe host then went on to say that many Republicans are absolutely  freaked out  because of Trump s embarrassing press conference.Here s the video via YouTube:It s clear that Donald Trump is unfit to be president and if Republicans have even a splinter of spine left they will do the right thing for America and impeach him before we become even more of a laughingstock to the world.Featured image via screenshot",News,17-Feb-17
 REPORT: Even Republicans Are ‘Disturbed’ By Trump As Congress Looks For A Way To Oust Him,"Donald Trump s days in the White House could be numbered if Republicans stop denying reality.On Thursday, Trump delivered an insane press conference in which he spewed a string of lies and bragged about how many electoral votes he received.He repeatedly claimed that the media pushes  fake news  and openly praised conservative outlets like Fox News for kissing his ass.Overall, Trump demonstrated once again that he is totally unfit to hold the office he occupies and that is why lawmakers are actively pursuing ways to kick him out of the White House before he does something even crazier.Earlier this week, Rep. Earl Blumenauer called for a congressional review to explore the constitutional process to remove an unstable person from the presidency. It s not normal behavior,  Blumenauer said.  I don t know anybody in a position of responsibility that doesn t know if they re being rained on, and nobody I work with serially offers up verifiably false statements on an ongoing basis. And that s why Rep. Ted Lieu is going to introduce a bill to require a psychiatrist work at the White House.Because if Trump is mentally unfit to be president (He is.) then the American people have a right to know and he should be removed from office so he can t harm anyone else or this nation ever again. I am not a mental health professional, so I don t know in terms of any sort of medical expertise on this,  Lieu said in defense of the bill.  But I do see and hear the same things that other people see and hear, and a lot of people have concluded that what s going on is not normal. So what do I do with that as a member of Congress? Anyone who can launch 4,000 nuclear weapons in minutes absolutely should be questioned on any matter related to their physical and mental health. Exactly. Trump is so unstable and predictable that he could literally launch a nuclear strike any time over the smallest slight. The fact that random guests at the Mar-a-Lago parties can take pictures with the guy who carries the nuclear football is also worrying.Even Republicans think Trump s behavior is  disturbing  even if they do refuse to admit that he should be kicked out of office.Rep. Mike Simpson told The Hill that,  The behavior is somewhat disturbing,  but thinks  it s a stretch  to question Trump s mental and emotional stability.So the question is how much more proof do Republicans need before they admit that Trump is dangerous and needs to go? Because the fact that they are willing to defend him after all the insanity and chaos we have seen in the White House so far makes one wonder if they are mentally and emotionally stable enough to be congressmen.A Republican judge was brave enough to call for Trump s impeachment earlier this week. Republicans in Congress would be wise to listen to him.If President Obama had acted like Trump is acting they would have moved to impeach him on the first day. America has already put up with four weeks of Trump s bullshit and it s only getting scarier.It s time for Republicans to recognize the reality of the situation and do what s best for the country instead of what s best for the Republican Party. And that means Trump should be impeached immediately.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,17-Feb-17
 Eric Trump Just Asked The Labor Department To Let Him Hire Foreign Workers AGAIN,"If any other American company did this, Donald Trump would be attacking them on Twitter.But Trump has a double standard when it comes to his own business and the businesses owned by his family members.As you may recall, Trump has openly attacked Ford, General Motors, and a slew of other companies for building factories overseas instead of building them here and hiring American workers to do the jobs.Trump even attacked a Japanese automaker for building a factory in Mexico instead of in the United States.The hypocrisy here is that while Trump is attacking these companies for not hiring Americans, his own son is begging the Labor Department to let him hire foreign workers instead of giving jobs to Americans.Eric Trump owns Trump Vineyards, and for the second time he is asking the Labor Department to let him hire foreign workers.According to the petition filed, the workers would be paid over $11 an hour to perform manual labor in cold weather. Workers would also be exposed to chemicals and would have to lift up to 60 pounds of grapes onto a truck.Here s a screenshot of the specific section.Again, this is hypocritical. Donald Trump is constantly promising Americans that he will make sure they have jobs but his own son wants to hire foreign workers.This is yet another example of Trump not following the rules he s setting for everyone else.A real leader leads by example and if Trump refuses to tell his own son to hire American workers why should companies like Ford comply with his demands?Keep in mind that Trump is ordering raids to round up undocumented immigrants because Trump claims they take jobs away from Americans. The reality, however, is that these immigrants take jobs that most Americans do not want to perform, such as managing and harvesting crops. That doesn t mean there aren t American out there who wouldn t take them, and that means Eric Trump is taking jobs away from Americans by trying to hire foreign workers instead. That s shameful, especially since his dad promised to put America first.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,17-Feb-17
 REPORT: Trump Considering Using National Guard To Hunt Down Undocumented Immigrants,"Donald Trump reportedly wants to use the National Guard as his deportation force.According to the Associated Press, a leaked memo written by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly revealed that Trump might call up 100,000 National Guard troops to  round up  undocumented immigrants.BREAKING: Trump administration considers mobilizing as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorized immigrants.  The Associated Press (@AP) February 17, 2017The plan would be an  unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana. The memo states that the National Guard would only be used if a state s governor approves, but seeing as how Trump has the power to call up any National Guard unit he wants, he could easily ignore the wishes of governors.Let s say California Governor Jerry Brown refuses to let Trump use the California National Guard to round up immigrants. Trump could just ignore him and call them up anyway just because Brown is a Democrat and Trump doesn t like to be told no.Meanwhile, Republican governors will probably have no problem unleashing the military against immigrants.White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer denied that such a memo exists.. @seanspicer tells @kwelkernbc immigration plan is  100%  false:  There is no effort to utilize the national guard to round up immigrants  Benjy Sarlin (@BenjySarlin) February 17, 2017And Assistant mouthpiece Michael Short also denied it.Not true. https://t.co/T8rA87kJaU  Michael C.

Ryan Parker (@TheRyanParker) February 17, 2017@BenjySarlin @seanspicer @kwelkernbc Yet AP says it has a memo written by John Kelly. This is when that credibility issue comes into play.  Chanty (@Chantelesque) February 17, 2017Donald Trump s effort to round up immigrants in this country is exactly the same as what Hitler did to the Jews. And you can bet Trump will have to order concentration camps be built because the government will have to house them somewhere while they await deportation.This action is absolutely un-American. It s cruel and a total affront to humanity. Donald Trump is not merely rounding up immigrants who have serious criminal records. He s treating all undocumented immigrants as criminals.It should also be noted that if Trump is allowed to use the National Guard for such an action, he could use the National Guard to do even more sinister things. And it could be American citizens who become the targets.Featured image via Andrew Harrer   Pool/Getty Images",News,17-Feb-17
 WATCH: Trump Assumes Black Reporter Can Set Up A Meeting With Black Lawmakers For Him,"After claiming that he s  the least racist person,  Donald trump literally assumed a black reporter could set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus for him.Seriously, that actually happened during Trump s first solo press conference on Thursday.After talking about our inner cities like they are apocalyptic crime-infested war zones, American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan asked Trump if he will work with the Congressional Black Caucus. Trump s response was to assume that because Ryan is black she ll know the CBC members. He then told her to set up a meeting with them as if she is his servant. And then he accused Rep. Elijah Cummings of refusing to meet with him.Ryan: When you say inner cities, are you gonna include the CBC, Mr. President, in the conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as Trump: Am I gonna am I gonna include who?Ryan: Are you gonna include the Congressional Black Caucus and  Trump: Well, I would.

Do you want to set up the meeting?Ryan: No, no, no I m just a reporter.Trump: Are they friends of yours?Ryan: I know some of them  Trump: No, go ahead, set up the meeting. Let s go. Set up a meeting, I would love to meet with the black caucus. I think it s great, the Congressional Black Caucus, I think it s great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I can t move. It might be bad for me politically. I can t have that meeting. I was all set to have that meeting. You know we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, a nice guy.Ryan: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.Trump: He wanted it. But we called called called called. I can t make a meeting with him. Every day, I walk in, I said, I would like to meet with him, because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight.He was probably told   he was probably told, don t meet with Trump. It s bad politics.

 Trump Thinks Rush Limbaugh Is Real News And The Internet Mercilessly Responds,"Rush Limbaugh praised Donald Trump s insanely embarrassing press conference, so now he is referring to Limbaugh as real news.It s clear that Trump is going to continue calling any media outlets who criticize him  fake news. Trump even demanded during his press conference on Thursday that the media should take him at his word at all times and that he should get to decide when the media can write  bad  stories about him.The public is   you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don t know if it s true or false. Because they are not involved. I m involved. I ve been involved with the stuff all my life. But I m involved.

" WATCH: Fox News Host DEFENDS CNN Reporter, Tells Trump To Go F*ck Himself","Even Fox News is calling Donald Trump out for attacking the media.After a press conference that will go down as the most embarrassing and confusing ever given in this nation s history, Fox News host Shep Smith blasted Trump for attacking the press, specifically CNN reporter Jim Acosta.Trump often praises Fox News while bashing the other major news outlets and once again attacked the media during his first solo press conference in which he appeared to be just telling reporters what he was told to tell them.Trump repeatedly referred to CNN as  fake news  and personally attacked Acosta while he was trying to ask questions about the Russia scandal that has engulfed the White House. Russia is fake news,  Trump claimed. Russia   this is fake news put out by the media .The leaks are real. You re the one that wrote about them and reported them. I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said. You saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. If the information coming from the leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?  Acosta asked.Trump responded by trashing CNN for not taking him at his word instead of verifying his claims and reporting the truth. He then praised Fox & Friends for kissing his ass like a good propaganda machine. When you call it fake news, you re undermining the confidence in the news media,  Acosta shot back. Trump replied by telling Acosta that he knows when he should get good or bad stories in the news and suggested that the media should get in line and write the stories he wants them to write.Seriously.Trump went on to excuse his demand by saying he won the election and claimed his administration is running smoothly despite all the recent reports that say otherwise.Well, Shep Smith was not amused and he took Trump to the woodshed for it.First, Smith addressed Trump s disastrous attempt to hold a big boy conference all by himself. It s sort of our job to let you know when things are said that aren t true,  Smith said in defense of the media.  This president keeps telling untrue things and he does it every single time he s in front of a microphone   some of them aren t really big, but they re coming from the president. He then attacked the logic of Trump s claim that Russia is  fake news. He says Russia is a ruse, it s fake news. The leaks are real, but the news is fake. So, that s impossible. It s very confusing,  especially when Trump says thing that are  demonstrably, unquestionably, opinion aside, 100 percent false. Then Smith passionately defended Acosta. He s an accomplished reporter   a guy I ve never met, but a good reporter. [Trump was] treating him like   I m not even going to use the word. I m not going to give Twitter the love it needs. It s crazy what we re watching everyday, it s absolutely crazy. He keeps repeating ridiculous throwaway lines that are not true at all and sort of avoiding this issue of Russia, as if we re some kind of fools for asking the question. Really?  Smith continued into an epic conclusion.  Your opposition was hacked, and the Russians were responsible for it, and your people were on the phone with Russia on the same day it was happening, and we re fools for asking the questions? No, sir, we are not fools for asking this question, and we demand to know the answer to this question. You owe this to the American people. We have a right to know, we absolutely do, and that you call us  fake news  and put us down like children for asking this question is inconsequential. The people deserve that answer. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself and the media should absolutely keep doing their jobs by calling out Trump s lies every day.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,16-Feb-17
 GOP Senator DESPERATELY Worried About Trump’s Mental Stability; Texts CNN During Press Conference (VIDEO),"On Thursday afternoon, the world was treated to yet another Donald Trump press conference   the topic of which was to announce his latest Labor Secretary pick. He did that, but he did so much more. Reporters are in shock. It was combative. It was bombastic. It was nuts, and not in the cute way. This is a man who s clearly not fit to be president of a PTA, let alone President of the United States.For the moment, though, he is President of the United States and even Republicans are secretly mortified at the prospect of having this insane monster at the helm for the next four years. One even texted CNN during the press conference, saying that Trump should see a therapist. I got a text from a couple of Democrats during the thing, who of course are not inclined to like him,  King said Thursday,  But I got a text from a Republican senator who said in this text,  He should do this with a therapist, not on live television. How bad was it? Well, like most days since Trump was elected, he boasted about it and lied about the win. He complained about the media. He suggested that an African-American reporter is  friends  with the Congressional Black Caucus and should set up a meeting between Trump and the caucus. Here s a partial video:This Senator, who is remaining nameless, is not the first to suggest that Trump needs medical help. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) has gone so far as to require a mental health professional be on staff for the president. His disconnection from the truth is incredibly disturbing,  he said.  When you add on top of that his stifling of dissent, his attacks on the free press and his attacks on the legitimacy of judiciary, that then takes us down the road toward authoritarianism. That s why I ve concluded he is a danger to the republic. Source: CosmoAnd this was before today s press conference. The bill, if passed (it likely won t get through the GOP Congress) would not just be for Trump. It would be for all future presidents. First, though, we need to do something about the madman with access to the nuclear codes. We need to do it now. The anonymous Republican knows it. They all do.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,16-Feb-17
 WATCH: NBC Reporter Calls Trump Out For Lying Repeatedly During Live Press Conference,"Donald Trump finally held his first solo press conference on Thursday and it did not go well at all.In fact, it was a complete and total disaster and an embarrassment.Throughout his remarks, Trump peppered the press and the American people with lie after lie.His principle target, of course, was the media, which he again accused of being  dishonest. The press has become so dishonest that if we don t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people,  Trump said.  Tremendous disservice. We have to talk about it. We have to find out what s going on because the press, honestly, is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control. I ran for president to represent the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure and what we re doing is we re talking about the power structure. We re talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media s going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort   not all the time   and some of the media s fantastic, I have to say, honest and fantastic   but much of it is not. The distortion, and we ll talk about it, you ll be able to ask me questions about it. We re not going to let it happen because I m here, again, to take my message straight to the people.Trump went on to claim that he inherited a  mess  from President Obama and portrayed the world as an apocalyptic wasteland that only he can fix.And then he bragged about his Electoral College win again as some sort of proof that the American people love him.I put it out before the American people, got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn t supposed to get 222. They said there s no way to get 222. 230 is impossible. 270, which you need   that was laughable. We got 306. Because people came out and voted like they have never seen before. So that s the it goes. I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they are not happy about it for whatever reason.Trump s press conference was a dumpster fire of lies. And NBC reporter Peter Alexander stepped up to the plate and called Trump out. You said today that you had the biggest electoral margin since Ronald Reagan,  Alexander began. He then proceeded to list President Obama s two electoral victories which were far bigger than Trump s in 2016.Trump then claimed that he was talking about Republican presidential wins.Overall, Trump s win is one of the smallest on record and he lost the popular vote by nearly three million votes.Faced with the facts and caught in a lie, Trump was asked  Why should Americans trust you? Trump claimed that he was given the information, suggesting that he was just reading remarks that someone told him to read.Alexander repeated his question and added to it. Why should Americans trust you when you accuse the information they receive as being fake when you re providing information that s fake?  he asked.All Trump could say in response was  I don t know. Here s the video via YouTube:Clearly, Donald Trump doesn t know how to do anything except lie. And this is why we have a free press to call him out for it.Featured image via screenshot",News,16-Feb-17
 Tapper SLAMS Trump For BIZARRE Behavior At ‘Wild’ And ‘Unhinged’ Presidential Presser (VIDEO),"There is certainly no love lost between CNN and the Trump Administration. Indeed, Donald Trump himself has called the mainstream news outlet   one of the most credible and trusted in the nation and world    fake news  for daring to report on the chaos coming out of the Trump White House. This hairy relationship is definitely  on full display on a regular basis when it comes to the host of The Lead and and State of the Union on CNN, Jake Tapper.Joining fellow CNN host Wolf Blitzer, Tapper took to the airwaves on Thursday to blast the bizarre and chaotic mess that passed for Trump s first presidential press conference since his inauguration. Tapper said of the spectacle, in which Trump was supposed to discuss his new nominee for Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta: It was a wild press conference. He talked about [CNN reporter] Jim Acosta more than he talked about Alexander Acosta. He talked about Hillary Clinton more than he talked about Alexander Acosta. Tapper then went on to say that the presser was really just a way for Trump to rant, lamenting that Trump stepped on his own messages and activities in his first month as president and  instead of focusing on these accomplishments   it was an airing of grievances. It was Festivus. It was complaints about the media. At one point he said the leaks were real but the news is fake, which doesn t make any sense what so ever. He said things that were not true. If you are a soldier in harm s way right now, if you are a hungry child in Appalachia or the inner city, if you are an unemployed worker in the hallowed shell of a steel town, that s not a president who seemed rather focused on your particular needs and wants. That s a president that s focused on his bad press. Tapper then went one to sum it up thusly: It was unhinged, it was wild. A lot of Americans are going to watch that press conference and think, that guy wasn t focused on me and I don t know what he was focused on. Tapper is exactly right. Trump is clearly losing it in a fit of rage, and there s absolutely nothing to do but to conclude that he held that press conference to attack the media and other people he perceives to be enemies. He wanted to unload in front of a national and international audience, because he cannot accept the fact that most of what is going so wrong in his fledgling administration is the fault of his own ill-tempered, impulsive actions, and of the incompetence of his White House staff.In short, this man is in way over his head. He is most definitely unhinged   and he has the nuclear codes.Watch Tapper annihilate Trump below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,16-Feb-17
 LOL: Putin Is Angry Now Because Trump Gets More Media Coverage In Russia Than He Does,"Vladimir Putin is super pissed because Russian media is covering Donald Trump more than him, and he only has himself to blame.Over the course of the election, Putin ordered Russian state media to endorse and positively cover Trump s campaign in an effort to help Trump win against Hillary Clinton.Putin wanted a puppet in the White House, and he basically got one. After all, Russia is preparing for war in Europe in anticipation of Trump weakening NATO by pulling American support. Russia has also been getting really aggressive by simulating air attacks on a United States Navy destroyer and they have a spy ship parked really close to our shoreline. Russia has also deployed cruise missiles in violatio of a treaty. And if that s not enough, Trump is still expected to lift sanctions placed on Russia.The Kremlin is currently enjoying the fact that Trump has a bunch of pro-Russia staffers in his administration and Russian media loves that fact as well. So they have continued lavishing Trump with the kind of praise and ego-stroking that American media outlets refuse to provide.But Russian media won t be doing nearly as much now because Putin is reportedly tired of waiting for Trump to do his bidding and he is jealous of the media coverage Trump has been receiving.That s right. The honeymoon appears to be coming to an end between Trump and Putin, at least when it comes to how much Russian media covers him.According to Bloomberg, In January, Trump received more mentions in the media than Putin, relegating the Russian leader to the No. 2 spot for the first time since he returned to the Kremlin in 2012 after four years as premier, according to Interfax data. And so Putin has apparently ordered the Russian media to tone down their coverage of Trump so that Putin can get more coverage for himself. They won t pour buckets of criticism on Trump, they just won t talk about him much,  Russian journalist Konstantin von Eggert told Bloomberg.  The fate of Russia-American relations is much less predictable than it was just a few weeks ago. Indeed, a few weeks ago it looked certain that Trump would be able to get away with helping his buddy Putin take advantage of the United States. Now that Michael Flynn has busted Trump s connections with Russia wide open and Congress continues to discuss investigating the ties, Putin is not as confident Trump is the puppet he was looking for.But Americans should remain vigilant. Donald Trump is still in office, and until he is ousted permanently he will continue to be a threat to our national security. Putin could merely be making it appear like he and Trump are having a spat. He could be simply working behind the scenes or waiting until Trump s Russia scandal dies down.However, it s still damn hilarious that Putin is jealous of the media coverage his BFF is getting in his own backyard. Apparently, Putin is an attention-seeking snowflake just like Trump.Featured image credit   photo of Donald Trump by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.

 WATCH: CNN Host Fareed Zakaria ROASTS Trump For Embarrassing Press Conference With Netanyahu,"Donald Trump embarrassed himself and the nation yet again when he hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday.And CNN host Fareed Zakaria blasted Trump for being woefully unprepared.Throughout the press conference, it appeared that Trump was making it up as he went along, often needing Netanyahu to jump in to answer questions. You can t get a sense whether this was a seriously thought-out issue or, as happens so much with Donald Trump, he was just kind of winging it,  Zakaria told Don Lemon.On whether he supports the two-state solution, Trump bragged that he and Netanyahu will strike a bigger deal.Zakaria pointed out that the kind of deal Trump is talking about has been on the table for 15 years since the Arab League offered to recognize Israel s existence in exchange of the creation of an independent Palestinian state.So let s just get this straight. A group of Arab nations offered Israel peace and all Israel had to do is go through with the two-state solution? Seriously!?Clearly, Israel is standing in the way of peace.Anyway, Zakaria also had a problem with Trump s answer to a question about the rise of anti-Semitism since he was elected. Trump responded by bragging about his Electoral College win and then mentioned that he has Jews in his family as if that s supposed to make everyone feel better about the rising anti-Semitism.Zakaria said that all Trump had to do is condemn anti-Semitism and call out any of his supporters who are contributing to its rise. But to that would mean angering all of the white nationalists, including Steve Bannon, who support him. The whole thing was kind of surreal, and why it was embarrassing to watch a President be so under-briefed and by given this assist by the Israeli Prime Minister,  Zakaria concluded.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump needs to be better prepared for these press conferences. He is not going to be able to wing it for four years. The presidency is not something anyone can just  wing  and be successful at. That s clear considering Trump has been a disaster since he first took office.He needs to buckle down and start doing his homework. Maybe then he ll be able to actually discuss the issues instead of humiliating himself and our country.Featured image via screenshot",News,16-Feb-17
 Prominent Psychiatrist Gives One DAMNING Reason Why We Shouldn’t Call Trump ‘Mentally Ill’ (IMAGE),"Given Donald Trump s disastrous presidential campaign and his even worse first month in the White House, several experts have raised suspicions that Trump is mentally ill and must be evaluated immediately. However, for prominent psychiatrist Allen Francis, M.D., there s one major reason we shouldn t be calling Trump mentally ill   because he s something far, far worse.Dr. Frances, professor emeritus of psychiatry and behavior sciences at Duke University Medical Center, has just written a damning letter to the editor of The New York Times stating that regarding Trump as mentally ill is a direct insult to those with mental illnesses. According to Dr. Frances, who was involved in writing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (D.S.M.-IV), Trump  is bad, not mad  and  crazy only like a fox.  Frances said that claiming Trump has a mental illness is: a stigmatizing insult to the mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped with Mr. Trump (who is neither).Unlike those with actual mental illnesses, Dr. Frances argues that Trump causes distress rather than experiencing it  and has been rewarded for his  grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy.  Instead of busying ourselves trying to decide if Trump is mentally ill or not, Dr. Frances believes that: He can, and should, be appropriately denounced for his ignorance, incompetence, impulsivity and pursuit of dictatorial powers. Many mental health experts have spoken out about Trump before, but this is by far the most critical of them. No one can argue with Dr. Frances  assessment; everything Dr. Frances has pointed out about Trump s behavior have been things that Trump has done very publicly. You can read his full letter in The New York Times below: And is just the icing on the cake. Dr. Frances also wrote a blog post in Psychology Today in which he urged people to focus on Trump s actions instead of his mental state. Dr. Frances wrote: The urge among amateur diagnosticians to mislabel Trump as mentally ill is perfectly understandable. They are terrified (as am I) by his dictatorial and impulsive behavior and feel compelled to resort to psychiatric name calling as a way of delegitimizing him. But this is inaccurate, unnecessary, unfair to the mentally ill, ineffective, and badly off target.We must challenge Trump on his outrageous behaviors and constant lies, not on his mental status. Speculations on Trump s psychological motivations, or whether he believes his own lies, are both distracting and irrelevant.At this crucial moment, with our fragile democracy at serious risk, I really couldn t care less why Trump does what he does. It is his dangerous actions that count, not the psychological reasons he does them. Dr. Frances also tweeted this on Tuesday: I m so tired of amateur analyses of Trump s psychology or diagnosis. Focus on real danger- his grab of dictator power. Dr. Frances is dead right. While we may never understand what goes on in Trump s mind, the real threat to America is his love of unchecked power   and we shouldn t lose sight of that.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images",News,16-Feb-17
 Steve Bannon Insulted Reporters To Their Faces As They Waited Outside Press Secretary’s Office,"Just about every journalist who was waiting took to Twitter to report the incident of verbal harassment by Donald Trump s top adviser.As Trump continues to expect and demand that the media say nothing but good thing about him and his administration, Steve Bannon undermined him by directly insulting the many reporters who were lined up waiting outside of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer s office on Wednesday afternoon.As the reporters were waiting, Steve Bannon walked out of the office with Reince Priebus and said,  the opposition party, all lined up! CNN s Jim Acosta wrote:Bannon with Priebus to reporters gathered outside Spicer s office:  the opposition party.  Jim Acosta (@Acosta) February 15, 2017The Dallas News was also there:Bannon emerges w/Priebus from @presssec office, spots 20 or so reporters camped out, says,  The opposition party, all lined up.  Todd J. Gillman (@toddgillman) February 15, 2017So was Roll Call:Steve Bannon and @Reince walk by reporters awaiting gaggle:  The opposition party all lined up,  Bannon said.  John T. Bennett (@BennettJohnT) February 15, 2017And the New York Times:Reince & Bannon emerged from Spicer s office just now, looked at scrum of reporters. Bannon:  The opposition party, all lined up.  Julie Davis (@juliehdavis) February 15, 2017The Daily Mail, too:Steve Bannon walks by a large group of reporters camping out, says to us,  The opposition party, all lined up.  Francesca Chambers (@fran_chambers) February 15, 2017Bannon has been calling the media the  opposition party  for a few weeks now and the term has disturbed media outlets and defenders of the free press because it s usually dictators who see the press as the enemy.During a phone call with the New York Times last month, Bannon whined about the media and said they should keep their  mouths shut and listen  and used the term  opposition party  to describe the media for the first time. The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for awhile,  Bannon said.  I want you to quote this. The media here is the opposition party. They don t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States. Clearly, Donald Trump and his team only consider conservative media outlets  real news  because they don t ask tough questions and they wholeheartedly support Trump and his destructive agenda. Over the last three press conferences, Trump has only taken questions from conservative outlets.But real journalists are supposed to be tough. They are supposed to ask hard-hitting questions. They are not supposed to be propaganda outlets for the president. But apparently that s what Trump and Bannon expect the media to be. If they had their way, America would not have a free press at all.Every time Bannon and Trump insult the media they are only provoking journalists. And provoked journalists work hard to expose the lies and scandals Trump doesn t want the American people to know about.Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are fascists. And fascists should not have any power whatsoever in our country. If that were not the case, our World War II generation would have just let the fascists win without a fight.And fighting is what the press and the American people must do now.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,16-Feb-17
 Twitter Beautifully Fact Checks Trump In Real Time After He Calls Russia Scandal ‘Fake News’,"According to what White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, Trump requested the resignation of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn due to the erosion of trust. Flynn lied to the administration regarding discussions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Trump literally fired Flynn but he s now calling the scandal  fake news.  The amateur president has been lashing out at networks reporting on the scandal, calling them  fake news,  too. Thursday morning, Trump went on quite a tweet-storm.

 Reporter’s Question About Russia P*ssed Trump Off So Much He Kicked Everyone Out Of His Office,"If you want to know how Trump treats the press, you need only read the White House press pool report from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s visit:The pool was then ushed into the Oval. POTUS and Benjamin Netanyahu sat in two chairs set up in front of the fireplace. FLOTUS sat on the couch to POTUS s right. Sara Netanyahu sat on the opposite couch. POTUS referred to the press as:  The nicest people over there. This remark was a clear attempt to soften up the people Trump usually demonizes as  fake news  and the  lying media.  In fact, the report says Trump even went out of his way to compliment  FAKE NEWS  CNN s Sarah Murray on a recent story. It was then that Murray, undeterred by The Donald s effort to win her over with a couple compliments, asked her question and all hell broke loose:He called out to CNN s Sara Murray and complimented a recent story. She asked POTUS to comment on whether his advisors contacted Russian intelligence officer during the campaign. *_Trump did not respond to her question._* Pool was asked to leave.This should have been an easy question for Trump. The answer is  yes.  Calls between key Trump staffers have not only been intercepted and made public by our own intelligence agencies and those of our allies who now have to spy on us because Trump is likely compromised. Michael Flynn just resigned because of his discussions of sanctions with the Russian ambassador while Obama was still President.Instead, Trump said nothing. No admission of wrongdoing, no promise to vet his people better or to actually do his f*cking duty to the American people, nothing.The terrifying thing is that Trump doesn t have to say anything.House Oversight Committee Jason Chaffetz   that s the guy who led the charge against Hillary Clinton  has already vowed that he will never satisfy their desire to bring down Donald Trump.  Rand Paul accidentally admitted that Republicans won t back a Trump investigation because they re too busy taking healthcare away from our country s most vulnerable. Besides, it s not like Trump is a Democrat, right? I just don t think it s useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party,  Paul says.  We ll never even get started with doing the things we need to do, like repealing Obamacare, if we re spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans. I think it makes no sense. Think about that. Trump wasn t joking when he said he could shoot someone in public and not lose support   and he wasn t just talking about voters. At this point, we can pretty safely assume that our government is compromised to the point that he can literally get away with anything.

 New Poll Paints A HUMILIATING Picture For Trump Just One Month Into His Presidency,"As Trump prepares to kick off his 2020 campaign so he can avoid doing real work in the White House, a new poll has devastating news for him: If the 2020 election were held tomorrow, a generic, unnamed Democrat would beat him. That means that more people would vote for pretty much any Democrat in order to keep Trump from being re-elected.The Politico/Morning Consult poll has 43 percent of respondents saying they would probably pick the Democrat even without a name right now. Only 35 percent said they would vote for Trump.Worse, the number of Trump voters who would vote for him again is slipping. 71 percent of Trump voters said they d vote for him again, compared to 87 percent of Hillary s voters who would vote for the generic Democrat.And perhaps even worse than that is the fact that 26 percent of people who answered this poll believe Trump is the worst president we ve had since WWII. 25 percent hold that same opinion of Obama, but Trump s presidency is all of one month old. Obama served his eight years and has a legacy for people to look at.It s really not often that people believe history will view a president that badly just thirty days into his first term.For Trump, where his image and ego are everything, the idea that people would rather support a generic someone over him has got to be horrifying. This is a poll he would probably call  fake news,  because of the people who line the streets outside Mar a Lago (who are protesters), and all the electoral votes he won, and so on.Add all of this to the fact that he really is planning a campaign event in Florida for this weekend, and has declared himself eligible for candidacy for 2020 already, and what it shows right now is that people believe he can t do the job. Presidents often enjoy a certain  honeymoon  period with both the press and the populace following their election. Trump has been screwing up so badly so quickly that his honeymoon didn t even happen.The only people who still think he s doing a good job are his most ardent supporters. But those people would support him even if he nuked the U.S. back into the Stone Age.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,15-Feb-17
 WATCH: Trump Responds To Rising Anti-Semitism By Bragging About His Electoral College Win,"How can the Israelis, or any Jewish person for that matter, trust Donald Trump if he can t even answer this question seriously?During his press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump took a question from a reporter who wanted to to know what he plans to do about the rising incidents of hate and anti-Semitism in this country and asked Trump to also address the fact that members of his own team have taken racist tones. Mr. President, since your election campaign and even after your victory, we ve seen a sharp rise in anti-Semitic   anti- Semitic incidents across the United States,  the reporter began.  And I wonder, what do you say to those among the Jewish community in the states and in Israel and maybe around the world who believe and feel that your administration is playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tones? Indeed, hate crimes have skyrocketed across the nation since Trump was elected and he has done very little to combat them. Meanwhile, Trump s administration included white nationalist Steve Bannon and racist Jeff Sessions and all but two members of Trump s Cabinet are white men.In response to the question, Trump outrageously proceeded to brag extensively about his Electoral College victory as if that somehow will stop anti-Semitism. Well, I just want to say that we are, you know, very honored by the victory that we had   306 electoral college votes,  Trump said.  We were not supposed to crack 220. You know that, right? There was no way to 221, but then they said there s no way to 270. And there s tremendous enthusiasm out there. Trump couldn t even get his own election count right. First, he received 304 votes when the Electoral College met in December. Furthermore, his win is one of the smallest on record and he also lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.Trump then claimed that he will bring peace to America and went on to use a line that sounds eerily similar to a racist saying they aren t racist by claiming to have black friends. In Trump s case, he suggested that anti-Semitism will be magically solved by his administration because he has Jewish family members. He concluded by telling the reporter that he will  see a lot of love  over the next few years.I will say that we are going to have peace in this country. We are going to stop crime in this country. We are going to do everything within our power to stop long simmering racism and every other thing that s going on. There s a lot of bad things that have been taking place over a long period of time.I think one of the reasons I won the election is we have a very, very divided nation, very divided. And hopefully, I ll be able to do something about that. And I, you know, it was something that was very important to me.As far as people, Jewish people, so many friends; a daughter who happens to be here right now; a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren. I think that you re going to see a lot different United States of America over the next three, four or eight years. I think a lot of good things are happening.And you re going to see a lot of love. You re going to see a lot of love.Here s the video via YouTube:Let s not forget that neo-Nazis supported Trump s campaign and they continue to support him today. Let s also not forget that Trump didn t mention Jews at all when he issued a statement in remembrance of the Holocaust, a tragedy that resulted in 6 million Jews being murdered by Hitler.Once again, Trump demonstrates that he is an embarrassment. He had a chance to address this issue seriously, but he made it all about him and his ego before making very few references to anti-Semitism and how he plans to actually stop it. He didn t even mention Jews beyond pointing out that he has Jewish family members as if that somehow makes him qualified to deal with anti-Semitism.Trump is clearly not fit to be president.Featured image via screenshot",News,15-Feb-17
 Trump Is LITERALLY Kicking Off His 2020 Re-Election Campaign In Florida This Weekend,"For the third time in a row, Trump will head down to Florida for the weekend because he can t stand the White House. However, it seems that this particular weekend vacay is different: It s a rally at Orlando International Airport, similar to the ones he held during his campaign. He s even got a neat little graphic on his Twitter announcement, which also reads the way the ads for his campaign stops read:Join me in Florida this Saturday at 5pm for a rally at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport! Tickets: https://t.co/9jDy1tYkgE pic.twitter.com/GDhO6GGxwt  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017Now, we already knew that Trump s advisers were trying to figure out a way to allow him to keep holding rallies so he could stroke his ego while in office. That s what his so-called  Thank-You  tour was all about. However, it seems that this one is a little different. White House press who ve spoken to Spicer about it are saying the following:Spicer says Trump rally in FL Saturday is a  campaign  event. So the 2020 campaign has begun.  Jim Acosta (@Acosta) February 15, 2017Spicer on POTUS event on Saturday in FL:  It s being run by the campaign  Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) February 15, 2017It s a campaign event, and it s being paid for by the campaign, although speculation says otherwise:This means that Trump s campaign must pay some of the costs for Air Force One, travel and lodging for aides. Wanna bet they don t do that? https://t.co/jQx0Gz0gXt  Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) February 15, 2017Here s more:White House referring Qs about @realDonaldTrump FL rally to the president s campaign.Trump is having a campaign rally 1 month into term  Mike Memoli (@mikememoli) February 15, 2017What?President Trump will make it all the way to his 30th day in office before having a campaign event pic.twitter.com/KrnRuOUwvr  Mark Berman (@markberman) February 15, 2017Yeah. He filed a letter with the Federal Election Commission saying he meets the candidacy threshold for 2020 on the day he was inaugurated, and now he s holding campaign events. And Spicer is saying the campaign will pay for them. The campaign will pay for use of Air Force One and lodging for the Secret Service and all his aides? Sure.But more than that, this is another way for him to avoid real work, and possibly to distract from the scandals mounting in the White House. He hates the business of being the president because he can t do what he wants, when he wants and how he wants. He can t be a dictator, and he can t tolerate people actually telling him he s wrong. But he can hold these rallies full of cheering people who admire him and hold him up as a god who s right about everything.This isn t normal. This is terrifying.Featured image by Mark Wallheiser via Getty Images",News,15-Feb-17
 WATCH: Jake Tapper Teaches Trump The Difference Between Conspiracy Theories And Real News,"Donald Trump just got humiliated with facts again by CNN.On Wednesday morning, Trump once again attacked CNN by calling them  fake news  and accused them of pushing  conspiracy theories  in response to their reporting on the Michael Flynn scandal.The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017Flynn got caught lying about his discussion with Russian officials about the sanctions President Obama placed on Russia.Because Flynn was not a government official at the time, he violated the Logan Act. He also lied to Mike Pence about the discussion, and Pence proceeded to unknowingly lie in defense of Flynn and his activities.Thanks to White House staffers who leaked the truth, Trump was forced to accept Flynn s resignation.And Trump didn t like that so he lashed out at the media for reporting the leaks.Well, CNN host Jake Tapper BURIED Trump Wednesday afternoon by teaching him the difference between conspiracy theories and real news. The media, of course did not fire General Flynn, President Trump did,  Tapper pointed out. Now what the media did do was reveal to the nation that General Flynn had lied to the Trump team including Vice President Pence when he claimed he never discussed Obama s sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador. President Trump knew this at least as early as January 26th. But he did not act on this until media revealed the truth to you, and, as it turns out, Vice President Pence. Of course these stories are not conspiracy theories, these are news stories sourced by government officials,  Tapper continued.  Conspiracy theories are different, they re false, they re crackpot, they re nonsense. Tapper then proceeded to give Trump examples of conspiracy theories, such as when Trump claimed that Ted Cruz s dad helped kill John F. Kennedy or when Trump pushed the lie that President Obama was born in Kenya. THOSE are conspiracy theories,  Tapper declared.  These are facts. Ad if Trump weren t already humiliated enough, Tapper also slammed Trump s hypocrisy on leaks. Throughout Trump s campaign he cheered on Wikileaks and the FBI for leaking information he could use against Hillary Clinton. But now that the leaks are about him and his administration, he s pissed off about it. No president likes leaks, but it s worth noting candidate Trump s path to power was tread on a road of leaks. He didn t have a problem with leaks then. It s not a moral position if you only hold it when it applies to you. Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump really needs to stop attacking the media. It s embarrassing.Featured image via screenshot",News,15-Feb-17
 REPORT: Fox News Might Be Under Investigation By Federal Authorities,"If federal authorities discover what they are reportedly looking for, the Republican propaganda network could be in deep sh*t.Last year, Roger Ailes was ousted as Fox News boss because Gretchen Carlson and other female anchors filed sexual harassment lawsuits.According to Carlson s lawsuit, Ailes punished her after she refused to have sex with him. He constantly ogled her and told her to wear short skirts to emphasize her legs. He also allowed misogyny to run rampant. Carlson even named current Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy in the lawsuit.First, Ailes demoted Carlson by removing her from Fox & Friends. And then he fired her after she continued to refuse to sleep with him to further her career.The case against Ailes was so damning that even Megyn Kelly defended Carlson.Eventually, Ailes settled the lawsuit and Fox News paid Carlson $20 million. Ailes was then fired by the company and given a $40 million severance package.And that money is the source of a possible investigation that federal authorities are considering or already moving forward with.Andrea Tantaros  lawyer Judd Burstein, who is representing her in her sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News and Roger Ailes, recently received a subpoena from federal prosecutors. And he told the Hollywood Reporter what it means. Once I saw it, I knew what was happening,  Burstein said.  They were investigating whether Fox News violated securities laws by not reporting settlements to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In other words, Fox News may have settled the lawsuit against Ailes without informing the shareholders of the decision to pay Carlson $20 million while also agreeing to pay Ailes $40 million. Their haste to quickly sweep the lawsuit out of national headlines would be a violation of rules set up by the Securities and Exchange Commission.In a statement following the report, Fox News claimed the corporation has not received a subpoena, but did say they have been in contact with U.S. Attorneys. The court granted FOX News  motion to send Andrea Tantaros  case to arbitration, where it always belonged, and rejected her counsel Judd Burstein s histrionics. Apparently one of Mr. Burstein s other clients has received a subpoena. Neither FOX News nor 21CF has received a subpoena, but we have been in communication with the U.S. Attorney s office for months. We have and will continue to cooperate on all inquiries with any interested authorities. If Fox News gets busted for not informing their shareholders they could end up paying a hefty fine to settle with the SEC. That just takes more money out of Rupert Murdoch s pockets and could make it more difficult for the company to make huge offers to Fox hosts and anchors to stick around when it s time to renew contracts. It would be a major financial setback for the conservative propaganda machine.Hopefully, federal authorities are able to launch or continue their investigation without interference from Donald Trump.Featured image via Dangerous Minds",News,15-Feb-17
 Some Of The White House Leaks May Be Coming From The MOST Unexpected Place,"The Donald Trump administration is beginning to represent an 80s horror film   the leak is coming from inside the (White) House and at least one is coming from one of Trump s most trusted people, Kellyanne Conway.According to CNN as told to them by trusted sources, Conway is trying to throw White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer under the bus.Spicer, who, more than even Conway, is the public face of the Trump administration, has become a national laughing stock, especially after being played (far too accurately) by Melissa McCarthy on Saturday Night Live.The narrative is that Trump is unhappy with Spicer and that the fact that he was so easily played by a woman shows him as  weak. Of course, there s also the fact that the media absolutely hates the guy who often berates them and pretty much always lies. Could it be, though, that the rumors of Spicer s demise are premature and that it s all a plot by Conway to rid her of at least one of the people she s always having to defend.So where is the narrative coming from? Spicer declined to comment on the record for this article, but Bannon and Priebus dismissed the leaks about his fate as scuttlebutt from lower level staff. Or maybe  the media, the opposition party  was just making it up, Bannon said.Many people sympathetic to Spicer in and out of the White House believe otherwise. Five of these sources think the person behind the leaks is Kellyanne Conway, Trump s ever-visible White House counselor. Though they offer no hard evidence, they say Conway is trying to offload blame for administration setbacks on Spicer to prove she is the more effective public advocate and earn a lasting place in the President s inner circle. She s clearly guiding a press narrative that he s not up for the job, and that they re reviewing other candidates,  one GOP strategist said.  It s becoming abundantly clear that Kellyanne is making Sean s job impossible. Source: CNNConway denies all of this, saying that  Sean has my full support.  The White House says the same of Spicer.Of course, the Trump administration would be far from the first to put a public happy face on a tumultuous situation, but there are several reasons to believe that Spicer might be on the way out, but the only one that really matters is that Spicer is embarrassing an already teetering on the edge presidency. In other words, it s likely that the leaks are right   Spicer s days are numbered. Whether or not that comes from Conway is another question. However, if she s leaking this, it means the loyalty is eroding and bigger leaks could be in her future.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,15-Feb-17
 Whiner-In-Chief: ‘Fake Media’ Is Being Mean To ‘Wonderful’ Michael Flynn (VIDEO),"When alleged president Donald Trump doesn t like unfavorable coverage, then he calls it  fake news.  The media is striking back, though, after his repeated attacks. Trump is plagued with scandals after being on the job for just a few weeks. To address his ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn s scandal, Trump said that the former aide was subjected to  criminal  leaks in the  fake media. I think he s been treated very, very unfairly by the media   as I call it, the fake media, in many cases,  Trump said at a joint press conference Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  I think it s really a sad thing he was treated so badly. Trump needs to get his story right with his team. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said just yesterday that Trump demanded Flynn s resignation because of  trust  issues.Trump thinks the disgraced retired General is a swell guy:Trump called Flynn a  wonderful man  and doubled down on his condemnation of the leaks from the intelligence community that exposed Flynn misled senior officials in the White House about his conversations with Russia s ambassador. Those conversations took place the day that then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for its interference in the election. From intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked, it s criminal action. It s a criminal act, and it s been going on for a long time before me, but now it s really going on,  Trump said.Watch:  People are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton,  he added.He said the same thing on Twitter this morning. He s blaming Hillary Clinton for his scandal-plagued administration.This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton s losing campaign.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017This morning he lashed out about the leaks. Funny thing about that: In 2016, Trump said,  I love WikiLeaks!  And now in 2017, he hates leaks.The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by  intelligence  like candy. Very un-American!  Donald J.

 New York’s Attorney General Could Literally Put Trump Out Of Business,"After perhaps the worst day in presidential history, something is brewing in New York that could do far more damage than any political scandal ever could. It could put Trump completely out of business.A group in New York State is petitioning New York s Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, long a critic of Trump, is being urged to pull Trump s business charter altogether.The group is called Free Speech for People. They, like many liberal advocacy groups, are best known for ill-fated petitions, like this one attempting to impeach Trump. However, things could be different this time because of timing.The group did not unearth any new information about Trump s company. Instead, it dug up the company s past legal infractions, such settlements over housing discrimination charges in the 1970s and fraud allegations at Trump University last year, and argued that Schneiderman ought to take action against the company now that Trump has become president and declined to sell his interests. By continuing to operate under Trump family ownership and control with President Trump in the White House, the Trump Organization flagrantly abuses its state-granted powers, contrary to the public policies of New York against corruption and conflicts of interest, and contrary to the U.S. Constitution,  the letter reads.Source: Washington PostWith one breaking scandal after another since the day Trump took office (less than four weeks ago), the public mood, especially in blue state New York, it turning against the wannabe dictator. Between Trump s Russia scandals (potential treason) and the fact that Trump refuses to divest himself from his business interests.While most in politics might dismiss the letter as being from liberal cranks (conservative cranks are typically the only ones politicians pay attention to), Free Speech for People have chosen the right target. Schneiderman has been fighting Trump since before Trump became a birther. He s currently in the process of suing Trump over immigration and he was one of the plaintiffs in the Trump University case.Schneiderman has acknowledged the letter, which is more than most would likely give us. Let s hope he takes up the cause. If you are in New York, contact Schneiderman s office at 800-771-7755.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",News,15-Feb-17
 WATCH: Kieth Olbermann DESTROYS Trump For Mishandling Intelligence Way Worse Than Hillary Ever Did,"Donald Trump continues to be a national embarrassment who is making our country less safe.At Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, Trump threw a party for his friends and random guests. And as that party went on, Trump was receiving sensitive information from aides as pictures were being taken all around him. Someone even managed to take a picture of and with the guy carrying the nuclear briefcase that the president needs to order a nuclear strike.Trump s lax attitude when it comes to national security intel is particularly alarming and hypocritical since he repeatedly accused Hillary Clinton of being irresponsible because of her emails.And Kieth Olbermann trashed Trump for it and pointed out that if Hillary Clinton has done what Trump is doing she would have been impeached immediately by the Republican-controlled Congress. It boggles the mind,  Olbermann began.  The president of the United States was reportedly receiving information vital to the security of the nation about a provocative North Korea missile test in a golf club restaurant. Not merely in a setting of insecurity, but surrounded by and photographed by people who could be anything from gawking tourists to Russian agents. And if this cannot get worse, the president couldn t be bothered to even leave the dinner to go to a slightly more private place where random passers-by cannot take souvenir pictures of a security briefing so they can post them later to Facebook. Oblermann went on to note that Trump staffers were trying to read the information handed to Trump via the flashlights on their cell phones, which can be hacked and used to transmit what they are reading to our enemies without them even knowing about it.Olbermann then destroyed Trump s hypocrisy. Trump slandered Hillary Clinton. You could argue Trump beat Hillary Clinton on charges on insecure handling of emails. Nothing she was ever accused of, nothing, comes close to this debacle near Trump s version of the Bushwood country club during the Korean missile crisis If Clinton had done just this, the Republicans would have impeached her before sunrise. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is reckless with our national security. His guests literally had a front row seat to the information he was being given. Any one of his guests could have easily been a spy from an enemy nation and they would now have information to use against us. This is a serious breach that Republicans in Congress must take seriously and that means they need to impeach Trump.Our national security is not a game. It s life and death for every American citizen.Featured image via screenshot",News,15-Feb-17
 Corey Lewandowski Is Apparently Using Trump’s Twitter Account To Get Jobs (DETAILS),"Corey Lewandowski was Donald Trump s right hand man up until the undeserving POTUS decided to fire him from his position as campaign manager. Even after being rejected by Trump, Lewandowski continued to humiliate himself on CNN by posing as Trump s spokesperson while he happily accepted money from Trump. Things came to a head when Lewandowski realized he couldn t get into the inauguration   but still hadn t embarrassed himself enough. Apparently with all things Trump-related, it could always get worse!According to a new report by Buzzfeed News, Lewandowski is using access to Trump s Twitter account as an incentive for potential clients. Apparently, Lewandowski has already told potential clients like Facebook and financial group Blackstone Group that he can access the account, and four sources say that it s become normal for Lewandowski to use Trump s account as a selling point.As usual, Lewandowski is choosing to deny the reports. When confronted by a Buzzfeed reporter who had spoken to these four sources, Lewandowski fired back: I know facts don t matter to Buzzfeed but it s not true. Lewandowski elaborated that he d  never  even met with Facebook or Blackstone Group. Taking a page right out of Trump s book, he said: I never met Blackstone. Please make sure you accurately report that! I doubt you will. Trump and the rest of his incompetent team have also stated that Lewandowski cannot access Trump s beloved Twitter account.There s good reason to believe that Lewandowski would stoop low enough to use Trump s social media accounts as selling points for clients. He was a major part of Trump s team on the campaign trail, and we all know that anyone working this closely to Trump can t possibly be an honest person. Lewandowski, much like his former boss, was a lying snake who would use anything to leverage his own success. It doesn t seem out of character at all for Lewandowski to do this   and he likely learned that mentality from Trump himself.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,15-Feb-17
" WATCH: Morning Joe Host Tells Kellyanne Conway To Go F*ck Herself, BANS Her From Show","Kellyanne Conway is definitely going to whine about this.CNN may have reversed their ban on Kellyanne Conway, but if Mika Brzezinski has her way, she won t ever be able to spread her lies on Morning Joe again.In the latest backlash against Donald Trump, the Morning Joe host declared that Kellyanne Conway will not be booked on the MSNBC program ever again because or her constant lies in defense of her tyrannical boss. I know for a fact she tries to book herself on this show,  Brzezinski said on the air.  I won t do it. I don t believe in fake news or information that is not true. That is   every time I ve ever seen her on television something is askew, off, or incorrect. Indeed, Kellyanne Conway lies so much on every media outlet she appears on it s a wonder her nose hasn t grown like Pinocchio s.Ever since she joined Trump s campaign she has been whining about how the media covers Trump and has insisted that her lies are the truth. Fact-checkers have had to work overtime to make sure the American people know that she is lying.Joe Scarborough opined that Conway lies because she isn t as close with Trump as shes says she is. She s just saying things just to get in front of the TV to prove her relevance because behind the scenes she s not in these meetings and any reporter can ask anybody in that White House and they will say the same thing. She s not in these meetings. So why does the president allow her to keep going out and spreading false information? Apparently, Trump is hoping that if Kellyanne Conway keeping repeating the lies that Americans will accept them as the truth.But Mika Brzezinski refuses to take part in that effort, so she made it very clear that Conway will not be invited on to Morning Joe as long as she is hosting. Kellyanne Conway does not need to text our show, as long as I m on it,  Brzezinski said.  It s not happening here. Here s the video via YouTube.Conway has been an embarrassment since day one. Her most recent embarrassments include peddling Ivanka Trump s product line in violation of federal ethics rules and making up a terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Kentucky in defense of Trump s travel ban. Beyond that, she fumbles so much that we ve lost count.The media should ban Conway from appearing on all shows across the board. All she does is spread propaganda and false information, and if Scarborough is right that she really doesn t know what s going on inside the White House then she shouldn t be considered a source worthy of interviewing.Featured image via screenshot",News,15-Feb-17

" Trump Whines About Fake News, CNN’s Chris Cuomo Just Shut Him Down PERFECTLY (VIDEO)","By now, we re all sick and tired of hearing Donald Trump whine about fake news, especially when he s team is a major creator of it.Earlier today, Trump went on one of his routine Twitter rants about fake news and unfavorable coverage, targeting  unwatchable  MSNBC and CNN for their  conspiracy theories  and  blind hatred.  To top it off, Trump happily endorsed Fox News, which has been proven to be the most dishonest media outlet there is.While Trump was whining about networks that tell the truth about how awful he is, CNN s Chris Cuomo hit back and completely shut him down. Cuomo pointed out that for someone who hates CNN, Trump is one of their most loyal viewers. Cuomo said: The president, as we know, watches  New Day.  We appreciate that viewership. He does not want to talk to us, but he does want to talk about us, and yet, this situation is different. He has said nothing to rebut the facts of this situation. On top of that, Cuomo and his colleagues spent the entire morning reporting on the details that Trump s senior advisors had been in  constant communication  with Russian intelligence during Trump s presidential campaign   making Trump look like a complete idiot.Cuomo also pointed out that fact that Trump hasn t been able to give an answer regarding Russia s involvement in the election or General Michael Flynn s communications with Russia that have now caused him to resign just 24 days after beginning his role as national security advisor. Cuomo said: Who knew? The idea that Flynn had to resign because he was soloing with this unique agenda with Russia that nobody else knew about, nobody had told him to do and nobody participated in is hard to believe and goes without good answer from the White House. Cuomo s attack on Trump is perfect, and hopefully it ll shut him up for a while so he can actually do his job:Featured image via screenshot and Alex Wong / Getty Images",News,15-Feb-17
 BREAKING: Republican Judge Calls For Impeaching ‘Dangerous’ Trump: ‘America Is At Stake’,"Donald Trump has been nothing but a disaster since taking office nearly four weeks ago and now even Republicans want him impeached.Of particular concern is Trump s ties with Russia and his assaults on the free press and the judicial branch.Trump seems to fancy himself a king and Republicans in Congress are gleefully treating him that way instead of doing their public duty to protect this country from threats like him.Well, a former Republican judge is disgusted with his party and he just publicly called for Trump s impeachment.Mark Painter served on the Ohio Court of Appeals for many years and the Republican Party is unrecognizable to him today. It used to be a center-right party but Trump has solidified it as the party of extremists who deny reality and facts with impunity.And that s why Painter is offering to help Republicans draft articles of impeachment to take Trump down before it s too late. In any time except our post-factual era, no office holder, much less the president, could get away with any one of the dozens of dazzlingly illegal things Trump has already done,  Painter wrote in a piece for Cinncinati.com.  They would forfeit office immediately. Each new day is a new nightmare. We are still trying to digest one breathtaking assault on America when another is signed, issued, or Tweeted. All this amid constant lies. Constant. Lies. It s tough, but we must end this dangerous presidency. Trump must be impeached and removed with all haste. But only Congress can initiate the process. Painter calls out Ohio Rep. Steve Chabot specifically and tells him to  man-up  and stop defending Trump, pointing out that Chabot helped draft articles of impeachment for Bill Clinton for far less than what Trump has done.Indeed, Bill Clinton had an extramarital affair in office and lied about it under oath. Donald Trump has lied about anything and everything, including his ties to Russia, his taxes, his conflicts of interest, etc He has violated the Constitution in so many ways it is hard to count them all. But Painter mentions a few. Basic American values   free speech, the rule of law, separation of powers, even common decency   are unknown in this White House. We now have a president who has no concept of separation of powers, or why we have three branches of government. If he knew anything about the Constitution, he would know the framers envisioned just the situation we have now   a would-be dictator. They provided checks and balances   such as an independent judiciary to protect us from presidential tyranny.We must admit we have elected a president who has immediately proved himself to be a grifter, a pathological liar, a mean-spirited bully and dangerous to American values. This not-ready-for-prime-time show is too dangerous to continue. America is at stake. It s time to end Trump s regime before he destroys our country. The only problem is that Republicans are eager to help him destroy it. In the end, elections, protests, and impeachment could be useless methods to get rid of Trump. As long as Republicans control Congress they will refuse to save the country and they will remain in control by trying to destroy voting rights. They are also already proposing bills designed to quell protests. And when peaceful methods of changing our government are taken away from the people, that only leaves the kind of method that Thomas Jefferson spoke of in a letter to William Stephens Smith in 1787.Hopefully, it won t come down to that. But we can t keep pretending that peaceful protests will make Republicans listen to reason, nor can we expect Republicans to stop chipping away at voting rights. And the fact that Republicans are okay with Russia helping their candidate win suggests they will expect foreign help in 2018 and 2020. We also can t expect the judicial branch to stop Trump because Republicans are already busy working on a bill to split up the Ninth Circuit Court as punishment for not agreeing with Trump s executive order.The American people need to rise up and demand the impeachment of Trump and his entire administration, and then a new election must be held. The future of our nation depends on it.Featured image via Andrew Harrer   Pool/Getty Images",News,15-Feb-17
 All HELL Breaks Loose After Trump Accuses Obama Of Being ‘Soft On Russia’ (TWEETS),"Donald Trump kicked off his Wednesday morning by launching into another insane rant about  fake news,  with a bonus guest appearance by a stupid comment about Hillary Clinton. The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable,  Trump said, continuing his attack on media that tells the truth about him. Of course, he was sure to endorse a network that generally distorts stories in his favor on behalf of the U.S. Government:  @foxandfriends is great!

After taking his traditional half-hour to figure out how he can sound even more like an uninformed madman than with his previous tweet, Trump informed us that any allegations that he or his staff are connected to Russia are simply attempts to cover up Hillary Clinton s massive popular vote victory he keeps denying happened:This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.

 Trump Staffers Are SO TERRIFIED Of Trump That They’re Using Secret Chat App To Avoid His Wrath,"While Trump is busy claiming that the real news stories are all the leaks coming from the White House, various staffers are so afraid of being accused of leaking information to the press that they ve resorted to finding ways to hide their electronic communications. Some of them are using a chat app called Confide, which erases messages as soon as they re read.Some of these staffers may be behind some of the rogue Twitter accounts, like RoguePOTUSStaff and possibly AltUSPressSec tweet things that they overhear in the White House. But there has been a proliferation of news stories citing anonymous sources within the White House as well, as staffers refuse to be named for obvious reasons.The funny thing is that use of Confide may violate the Presidential Records Act   certain staffers are required by law to use their official email addresses for communications. Using a secret app like Confide not only means they re not using their official accounts, but it also means there s no record at all.The fact that staffers are willing to break the law to avoid Trump s wrath is telling.And they have reason to be afraid. Sean Spicer pointed at government employees as the source of the leaks, saying: When we have government employees that are entrusted with this and then leak it out, that undermines our national security. That s a real concern for this president. And Rep. Devin Nunes, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, is more interested in rooting out the sources of the leaks than he is about whether or not Michael Flynn broke any laws with his communications with Russia.It s true that the White House leaks are unprecedented, at least insofar as one of George W. Bush s top officials is concerned. Nobody knows where the leaks are coming from yet, but when you have to resort to secrecy just to avoid your boss  wrath and accusations even if you re not doing anything wrong there s a serious problem.Featured image by Mario Tama via Getty Images",News,15-Feb-17
 37 Mental Health Workers Are BEGGING Congress To Impeach Trump,"It s been a very, very bad day for the newly elected Donald Trump administration. First, amid revelations of Russian connections, his National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign. Now, others may soon follow, but it s the big guy himself that has mental health professionals concerned and in an open letter in the New York Times, they begged that Congress and the media do something about it.The 37 mental health professionals, ranging from social workers to psychologists and psychiatrists have all violated the ethical code called the Goldwater Rule, which is a self-imposed ban on diagnosing public officials. Frankly, though, there hasn t been such a high-level politician who s been putting us in as much danger as Trump is (at least not since the resignation of Richard M. Nixon), so they felt it was time to speak out.While the letter doesn t diagnose Trump with a specific mental illness (like malignant narcissism), they are more generally concerned with Trump s delusions of grandeur.Mr. Trump s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists).In a powerful leader, these attacks are likely to increase, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump s speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president.Others have gone even further.In a bid to warn the public, psychologists are publishing their diagnoses of Trump. Most recently, John D. Gartner said Trump  is dangerously mentally ill and temperamentally incapable of being president. He believes Trump shows signs of  malignant narcissism,  which is defined as a mix of narcissism, antisocial personality disorder, aggression and sadism in Campbells  Psychiatric Dictionary.In December, three psychiatry professors wrote to President Obama, calling Trump  mentally unstable. His widely reported symptoms of mental instability   including grandiosity, impulsivity, hypersensitivity to slights or criticism, and an apparent inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality   lead us to question his fitness for the immense responsibilities of the office,  the professors from Harvard Medical School and the University of California wrote to the then President, urging him to order a  full medical and neuropsychiatric evaluation  of the then President-elect.Unfortunately, Obama, who was probably aware that Trump was mentally unfit, had no legal recourse to do anything. Trump, however, is a clear and present danger to our country. His refusal to accept even the tiniest amount of dissent, his business conflicts and his Russian associations make it too dangerous for him to remain in office for another day. Unfortunately, we have a Republican Congress that puts party before country. They d rather see it burn down than to damage their mission of complete corporate reign.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,15-Feb-17
 CONFIRMED: High-Level Trump Campaign Staff Was In ‘Constant Touch’ With The Russian Government (VIDEO),"Donald Trump may want to rethink his  wall  idea because his entire presidency is crumbling down around him. With Kellyanne Conway on her way out the door because she advertised his daughter s goods during a Fox News interview and Michael Flynn getting caught secretly talking sanctions with the Russian ambassador and Sean Spicer just being Sean Spicer, The Donald is already dealing with a lot   but now CNN reports that his campaign staff was in  constant touch  with high-level government officials in Russia.According to multiple current and former intelligence, law enforcement and administration officials, high-level advisers to candidate Trump raised red flags with U.S. intelligence because they were apparently calling each other more often than a middle school couple who has been dating for three days (that s a lot):Intelligence officials say they are still determining the intent of the frequent communications, but they are concerned that Trump associates were coordinating with Russian intelligence to release information that would damage Hillary Clinton. If that were the case, then that would escalate things,  one official briefed on the investigation told CNN.More than  a baker s dozen intelligence agencies have previously confirmed that Vladimir Putin personally spearheaded a massive hacking and propaganda/ fake news  campaign targeting Clinton in an effort to get Donald Trump elected.Since assuming office,  Easy D  has been nothing but friendly to Russia, even easing sanctions that targeted the very intelligence agencies that hacked our election and constantly praising Putin (including on the same day that Flynn spoke to his ambassador friend). Trump also may have disabled the recording during his first phone call as President with Putin.Things are not looking good for President Asterisk, and they seem to get worse by the day. It s time for Republicans to put country before party and get this lunatic out of office before he gets us all killed.Watch CNN s report on this new development below:Featured image via Getty Images",News,14-Feb-17
 Rand Paul SERIOUSLY Just Told Us Those Investigations Into Hillary Were Partisan Witch Hunts,"A scant few Republicans on Capitol Hill want investigations into Michael Flynn s ties to Russia, and by extension, Trump s. Others are sweeping it away by saying the issue took care of itself with Flynn s resignation. And then there s Rand Paul, who just told us the truth about why they were so insistent on investigating every last little thing about Hillary, but won t investigate Flynn or Trump despite far more demonstrable evidence of treason.While Paul may have a small point when he says it s not always a good idea to do investigation after investigation, that would really only apply if the GOP was impartially doing its job.They aren t. They never were. Paul s actual words were: I just don t think it s useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party. Really. It s a good idea to waste time, effort and money repeatedly investigating Hillary s emails and her handling of Bengazi, but it s not worth it to investigate real treason when it means investigating your own party?Please.At least he s finally admitted it. We already saw this with Jason Chaffetz and other Republicans saying they didn t think they were going to investigate the Trump administration s ties to Russia, but Paul just put it out there in the open.Furthermore, it seems he s suddenly quite interested in doing anything else: We ll never even get started with doing the things we need to do like repealing ObamaCare if we re spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans. I think it makes no sense. But if Flynn and the president were Democrats, it would make all the sense in the world. Paul and others would be screaming  TREASON!  over and over and setting up special independent panels everywhere to get to the bottom of this.It s possible even likely that they re afraid of how all this reflects on them. Make no mistake, it reflects badly. Not only do they look like complete idiots for not stopping Trump during the primaries when they had the chance, but now they look like treasonous hypocrites. The funny thing is, they d be less complicit in the treason if they d investigate it.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,14-Feb-17
 What Dan Rather Has To Say About Trump’s ‘Deadly Serious’ Flynn Scandal Is ‘Chilling’,"On Tuesday afternoon, legendary journalist Dan Rather weighed in on the Trump administration s latest scandal involving former national security advisor Michael Flynn s collusion with Russia. Watergate is the biggest political scandal of my lifetime, until maybe now. It was the closest we came to a debilitating Constitutional crisis, until maybe now,  Rather began. He explained that while he rates Watergate as a 9, and the Flynn scandal is only at a 5 or 6 right now, the situation  is cascading in intensity seemingly by the hour.  In hindsight, he said, we may one day see that  this is at least as big as Watergate.  This  is chilling,  Rather said. When we look back at Watergate, we remember the end of the Nixon Presidency. It came with an avalanche,  Rather continued. But up until then, things had  rumbled along with a low-grade intensity.  Things are different this time around.  This Russia story started out with an avalanche and where we go from here no one really knows,  he explained.We are still less than a month into the Trump Presidency, and many are asking that question made famous by Tennessee Senator Howard Baker those many years ago:  What did the President know, and when did he know it? Rather noted that recent reports indicate that Trump has been aware of Flynn s treasonous conversations for weeks. This leads him to ask,  how far does this go? The White House has no credibility on this issue. Their spigot of lies   can t we finally all agree to call them lies   long ago lost them any semblance of credibility. I would also extend that to the Republican Congress, who has excused away the Trump Administration s assertions for far too long. We need an independent investigation. Damn the lies, full throttle forward on the truth,  declared the famed journalist. He added that truth is definitely proving to be stranger than fiction when it comes to Trump s scandal-ridden presidency. If a scriptwriter had approached Hollywood with what we are witnessing, he or she would probably have been told it was way too far-fetched for even a summer blockbuster. But this is not fiction,  Rather said.  It is real and it is serious. Deadly serious. We deserve answers and those who are complicit in this scandal need to feel the full force of justice.

 REPORT: Russia Taunts And Tests United States As Puppet Trump Continues Fawning Over Putin,"Russia is testing how far Donald Trump will let them go and they are going frighteningly far.The Russian government has been cheering ever since they helped get their puppet in the White House.Trump has signaled that he may pull the United States out of NATO, which would weaken Europe and leave the continent vulnerable to a Russian invasion. Lithuania recently warned that the Russian military is preparing for such an invasion and that the military drill is the largest ever recorded near the borders of the Baltic states.Russia has also been launching cyber attacks and spreading propaganda designed to sway elections so that they can get weak leaders in office around the world. And so far, their strategy is working.Putin has Trump by the balls and he may also have ears in the White House Situation Room, according to American spies who are refusing to provide intelligence to Trump out of fear that Putin would learn about the same information.And now Russia appears to be testing our military resolve as well.On Saturday, Russian fighter jets flew by a United States Navy Destroyer on the Black Sea at a threatening altitude and speed and refused to communicate when queried about the flyovers. The same pattern occurred over  several hours. USS Porter queried all aircraft and received no response,  Captain Danny Hernandez said according to Reuters.  Such incidents are concerning because they can result in accident or miscalculation. The incidents involving the Su-24 were considered to be unsafe and unprofessional by the commanding officer of the Porter because of their high speed and low altitude, while the IL-38 flew at an unusually low altitude, Hernandez said.Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the closest incident that day involved the lone SU-24, which came within 200 yards of the Porter at an altitude of 300 feet (91 meters).Furthermore, Russia is also testing how close they can sail spy vessels to our shorelines.Fox News reported on Tuesday that a Russian spy ship was spotted 70 miles off the Delaware coast and it is unknown where the ship is heading.And if that isn t enough to make you worry about Trump s connections to Russia, the New York Times reports that Russia has deployed ground-based cruise missiles in violation of the treaty that ended the Cold War. The Obama administration protested the move when the missiles were being tested, but Putin waited till Trump took over the White House to actually deploy them.These are all serious warning signs that Russia is poised to launch a war, yet Trump is doing nothing but defending and kissing up to Putin. Russia is literally testing our defenses and getting more aggressive. Prior to Trump, every other modern president has been strong against Russian aggression. But now Russia knows that we have an inept weak leader in the White House who is incapable of standing up to Putin.We can no longer afford to continue letting Congress ignore Trump s relationship with Putin and Russia. Investigations must occur and they need to occur right now. Russia is only getting more aggressive and we need to put them in check and reassure Europe before it is too late.Featured image via screenshot ",News,14-Feb-17
 Kellyanne Conway Gets Caught Tweeting Her Love To A White Supremacist On Twitter,"Kellyanne Conway just embarrassed herself again while also demonstrating just how cozy the Trump administration is with white nationalists.It may be Valentine s Day, but as a public employee who represents Trump on a daily basis, Conway should know better.On Tuesday, a white nationalist Twitter account sent a Valentine s Day message to Conway. Your strength & resiliency in face of vile hatred, bigotry, & sexism of the unhinged Left is a daily inspiration! Love you! Well, if Conway had done a little homework, she would have discovered that the Twitter user is a white nationalist whose account proudly boasts that they  Hate Anti-American Liberals, Marxists, & Commies  with hashtags that say  #WhiteIdentity, #Nationalist, and #SteveBannon. As we all know, Steve Bannon is sympathetic to white nationalists and he is a favorite of white nationalist groups. Bannon is also Donald Trump s top adviser who is likely pulling the strings in the White House.Anyway, Conway told the white racist,  Love you back. After being called out on Twitter, Conway removed the tweet and claimed that someone else tweeted from her account.Seriously. I don t know who had access to my account,  Conway claimed.  Let me see who tweeted that. That s terrible. I denounce whoever it is. It will be immediately deleted. Everybody makes mistakes. Let s just get this straight. Kellyanne Conway works for the so-called  president.  She is one of his top advisers and probably has security clearances. Yet she claims someone she doesn t know managed to gain access to her Twitter account. That s a really pathetic excuse the day after Michael Flynn resigned as National Security Adviser for being a security risk.It s more likely that Conway retweeted the white nationalist and decided to lie about doing so. But either way, Kellyanne Conway looks incompetent.Clearly, Michael Flynn is not the only Trump adviser who should have resigned.Featured Image via screen capture ",News,14-Feb-17
 Neo-Nazis Think They Know Exactly Who Is Responsible For Forcing Flynn Out; Predicts Others Will Fall Too,"After evidence surfaced that suggested Russia had blackmail-worthy dirt on Trump s national security adviser, General Michael Flynn, Flynn was forced to resign on Monday. Some Americans aren t convinced that that was the real reason, though. Some are blaming it on  the Jews. Neo-Nazi writers are upset that retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has resigned from his position as national security adviser. The anti-Semites are lionizing Flynn as  one of our best guys  and a  true patriot  who has  been quite critical of the Jews in the past.  They are also lamenting that his resignation is  definitely a loss   to the Jews  and are speculating that he was pushed out by  more subversive elements in the White House. Source: Media MattersIt s not surprising that Flynn supporters would feel this way. After all, he s one of theirs.The disgraced former national security adviser has repeatedly pushed toxic views. Last July, Flynn shared a tweet that read in part,  Not anymore, Jews. Not Anymore.  (He later apologized.) He claimed on Twitter that  Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.  Flynn also endorsed the work of racist author Mike Cernovich, who has frequently pushed white nationalist themes on his Twitter account (many of which he later deleted). Cernovich has claimed that  diversity is code for white genocide,   Blacks use guns for murder. Whites use guns to kill themselves,  and  Diversity is bad for national security. The Daily Stormer, which is just one of the Neo-Nazi sites that s gaining popularity since Trump s election, had this to say about Flynn s resignation:This is giving a victory to the kike media.I actually didn t think the block on the travel ban was a loss. I think that was all part of the plan to get the public stirred up against activist judges, to get ready for the Supreme Court to rule on an even more hardcore version of the Moslem ban.But this.This is definitely a loss.To the Jews.Infostormer, another such site, predicts that more are about to fall:We re going to be keeping a much closer eye on the White House factional struggles in the coming days and weeks, because if my senses are correct, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will likely be the next man attacked for his ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin.The lead-up to the demise of General Flynn was somewhat ignored by us due to the sheer level of nonsense that has been pushed forth by the Lugenpresse lately, but we won t make that mistake again.The Jews are not going to get away with another bullying attack on our regime   they will be called out, and they will be defeated if and when they try again.I can t believe I m about to say this, but I hope the Nazis are right about Tillerson. As for the rest, well, it s not their  regime.  The presidency belongs to the American people all of us, even those of us who are Jewish. If a member of the government is antisemitic or in bed with the Russian government, you d better damned well believe that we will do everything in our power to stop them.Featured image by Mario Tama via Getty Images",News,14-Feb-17
 Office Of Government Ethics Orders White House To Punish Kellyanne Conway For Breaking Law,"Unwilling to do the right thing himself, the United States Office of Government Ethics just sent Trump a letter asking him to punish Kellyanne Conway for her clear violation of the law in promoting Ivanka s clothing line.Conway told a giddy Fox News morning crew that she loves Ivanka s clothing and urged viewers to rush out to buy more of the merchandise   all while standing in the White House briefing room.The OGE, like many independent lawyers, pointed out that this was a blatant violation of conflict of interest laws. Even more infuriating, the White House appears to have made no effort to discipline Conway for a violation that many assumed would end in her termination.Although Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated during a press conference on February 9, 2017, that,  Kellyanne has been counseled, and that s all we re going to go with,  OGE has not yet received notification of any disciplinary or other corrective ation against Ms. Conway. When OFGE has reason to believe that an employee may have violated the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, OGE is authorized to recommend that the employing agency investigate the matter and consider taking disciplinary action against the employee.The OGE again reiterated that, given Conway s shameless plug on national television, the evidence is plain to see and that  disciplinary action is warranted. Meanwhile, Trump is busy throwing his national security advisor under the bus after the Washington Post proved that Michael Flynn did, in fact, illegally discuss Russian sanctions with Russia s ambassador to the U.S. before Trump was inaugurated. Conway would represent the second high-profile advisor that Trump would have to jettison for separate ethics violations in a single week   surely some kind of record.So far, Trump has refused to do anything to punish Conway. In fact, he, too, used his station as president to promote his daughter s clothing line, tweeting a hit job on the Nordstrom retail chain for dropping her brand from its stores.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,14-Feb-17
 The Internet Can’t Stop Laughing After Sean Spicer Says Trump Is ‘Tough On Russia’,"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that Donald Trump is tough on Russia, even though he has heaped praise on Vladimir Putin and never condemned him as a murderous thug.  The irony of this entire situation is that the president has been incredibly tough on Russia,  Spicer said.  He continues to raise the issue of Crimea, which the previous administration allowed to be seized by Russia. His ambassador to the United Nations, stood before the U.N. Security Council on her first day and strongly denounced the Russian occupation of Crimea. Spicer s comments come after Michael Flynn, Trump s national security adviser, resigned Monday night after reports surfaced showing that he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States in regards to sanctions.Following Spicer s comments, the Internet, as it is wont to do, pounced.He didn t even send Putin roses this Valentine s Day. https://t.co/eSBGIB3xRL  Mark Salter (@MarkSalter55) February 14, 2017@ZekeJMiller @PressSec HAHAHAHAHA  John| #TheResistance (@jzirbaskev) February 14, 2017 The irony of this situation is that the President has been incredibly tough on Russia    #Spicy pic.twitter.com/iKmzVYr0Q0  Rachel Jogo (@idreamofgoodgov) February 14, 2017Spicer just said: Irony of this entire situation is that Pres Trump has been incredibly tough on Russia.

 Trump Was Whining About White House Leaks. Chrissy Teigen Just Hit Back And It Is BRILLIANT (TWEET),"It s mind baffling that Donald Trump still hasn t learned not to make stupid comments on Twitter, especially since people like model Chrissy Teigen are always sure to fire back with some seriously epic burns.During the campaign, Teigen was an outspoken supporter of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and made sure to shoot Trump down on Twitter whenever she could. Now that Trump is in the White House, Teigen has decided to turn it up even more   and The Donald isn t going to like it. Following General Michael Flynn s resignation last night, Trump took to Twitter this morning to whine about the  illegal leaks coming out of Washington    and he s going to wish he hadn t.It was a tweet that seriously lacked self-awareness, considering that just last weekend Trump held an impromptu national security meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinz  Abe right in front of dinner party guests. While Teigen didn t bother pointing that out, she made sure to remind Trump that everyone hates him. She fired back: This is what happens when your staff hates you. Beyonce s staff are more leakproof than yours. Ouch! Twitter loved Teigen for pointing this out, because Beyonc s team has been known to be tight-lipped, having somehow kept a wedding, pregnancy and major albums completely secret in the past.Teigen is right   Trump appointed several untrustworthy, unqualified people and now he s suffering for it. It is insane that just three weeks into his presidency, one of his administration members is resigning. The chaos and confusion (as well as overwhelming disapproval from the American people) has been unprecedented, and Trump seems to only make things worse for himself every time he complains about it on Twitter. There will always be people like Teigen who aren t afraid to hit back and expose Trump for the moron he is   and we should be thankful for them.Featured image via Michael Buckner and Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,14-Feb-17
" Joy Behar HUMILIATES Trump For Flynn Resignation, Says What We’re ALL Thinking (VIDEO)","Donald Trump and his incompetent, corrupt team got their a**es handed to them today on The View, following the massive controversy surrounding the resignation of General Mike Flynn from his role as National Security Advisor last night.This was a topic that co-host Joy Behar could not wait to get into, as she ripped into Trump and sarcastically said what most of us have been thinking about the Flynn situation: I thought he knew more than the generals! He knows everything else, right? Exactly. Trump spend his entire presidential campaign acting like he knew more than everyone else, and even remarked that he knew  more than the generals  do about ISIS. Now more than ever, Trump has proven that his statements were complete lies   and this fiasco with General Flynn exposes it perfectly. If Trump had known everything, he would have known that Flynn was speaking with Russian officials and that Flynn had lied to VP Mike Pence about his communications with Russia.Behar was hardly the only host on The View who wanted to say something about it   co-hosts Jedediah Bila and Whoopi Goldberg jumped at the chance to weigh in. Bila slammed Trump and his team for being so reckless with their appointments and for dropping the ball. She said: There s no way that he didn t know about it. Everyone went and said,  Look, this could potentially compromise our national security because this guy may potentially get bribed.  Then what happens? Kellyanne Conway has the responsibility to be informed. This is falling on the heels of her having that huge controversy promoting Ivanka [Trump] s line and now she s out there talking about,  I didn t know.  No, it s your job to know and it s Donald Trump s job to know. If there is someone in your administration that could potentially jeopardize our national security, that becomes our problem and it s your job to protect us. That s your one job! Goldberg also shredded Trump, stating that this is what happens when highly problematic, unqualified people are put in positions  just to piss people off. The entire show was filled with sarcasm and shots directed at Trump and his administration. This was one of The View s best anti-Trump segments, and you can watch the hosts go off on our should-be-impeached president below:Featured image via screenshot and Steve Pope / Getty Images",News,14-Feb-17
 Hypocrite Republicans Refuse To Investigate Flynn Scandal,"After years of investigating Hillary Clinton over Benghazi despite her resignation, Republicans are hypocritically refusing to investigate Michael Flynn.Donald Trump s national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned late on Monday night after getting busted for negotiating with the Russians while President Obama was still in office.Flynn s actions violated the Logan Act, which bars citizens from negotiating with foreign powers. Flynn s connections with Vladimir Putin run deep, and the Justice Department warned Trump last month that Flynn was at risk of being blackmailed by the Russians. Still, Trump kept Flynn on his team and even let him continue participating in meetings.Flynn, the national security adviser, was literally a national security threat and Trump refused to act.This comes months after an election that was tainted by interference from the Russians, and Republicans have yet to investigate that.And they are not going to investigate the Flynn scandal either.GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz told reporters on Tuesday,  I think that situation has taken care of itself. I think he did the right thing stepping down. By that logic, the Benghazi investigation should have ended after Clinton stepped down as Secretary of State in February 2013. But Republicans continued the investigation into December 2016.Chaffetz then passed the buck by claiming that the House Intelligence Committee is responsible for investigating Flynn, not the Oversight Committee.When asked by reporters if he would launch an investigation, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said he doesn t plan to do so and even went on to praise Flynn in the hope that the scandal will be swept under the rug.Here s the lawmaker who should be investigating Flynn and Trump s Russia ties, House Intel Chair Devin Nunes.Really taking this seriously. pic.twitter.com/ygfiajpYq3  Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) February 14, 2017And so, Republicans once again demonstrate that they are complete hypocrites.Republicans like Chaffetz spent years and wasted millions of taxpayer dollars to investigate Hillary Clinton over Benghazi. It was a witch hunt that went beyond the amount of time Congress spent investigating 9/11 and in the end it found nothing.Republicans literally accused Clinton of  national security malpractice  even though it was their cuts of diplomatic security funding that played a role in the lack of security at the consulate.Nothing Hillary Clinton could have done in response would have saved the four Americans who died in the attack. Furthermore, there have been even deadlier terrorist attacks against American embassies overseas that did not result in investigations, especially when such attacks occurred under Republican administrations.But Michael Flynn broke the law, lied about his phone calls with the Russian ambassador, and was a national security threat because of his closeness to the Russians, particularly Putin, and was at risk of being blackmailed.This is a major scandal of the Trump administration and the American people are demanding a lengthy and thorough investigation by Congress. The fact that Republicans don t want to do it shows how little credibility these lawmakers have. They don t really care about our national security. They only care about launching investigations for political gain.They are hypocrites and they should be ousted from office in favor of people who will conduct a proper investigation into this matter. And when that investigation exposes Trump s collusion with Russia we ll all know why Republicans didn t want to investigate Flynn. Because protecting the party is more important to them than protecting America.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,14-Feb-17
 This Newspaper Is Filing A Lawsuit Against A Republican Lawmaker For Calling Them ‘Fake News’,"Donald Trump better watch out because news organizations aren t going to take being called  fake news  anymore.If the Daily Sentinel files a defamation lawsuit against a Republican Colorado state senator it could trigger an avalanche of lawsuits by news organizations across the country.On Wednesday, the Sentinel published an opinion piece demanding that GOP state Senator Ray Scott allow an open records bill to pass the committee he chairs.Public records laws are important tools for combating misinformation and getting to the truth. But the state has no obligation to provide electronic records in useful formats that easily lend themselves to analysis.Senate Bill 40 would change that. The bill requires records custodians to provide records in digital forms if kept that way and requested as such. If a government agency keeps records in an Excel spreadsheet, for example, it should deliver them via open records request in the same format   not paper copies or PDFs, which aren t searchable, sortable or easy to aggregate.But first SB40 has to get past the same Senate committee that killed a similar version last year. The State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee was supposed to consider the bill on Monday but Republican Sen. Ray Scott of Grand Junction, who chairs the committee, said it wouldn t be heard as scheduled. SB 40 deserves a fair hearing before the full Senate,  the Sentinel continued.  We call on our own Sen. Scott to announce a new committee hearing date and move this bill forward. Open records shouldn t be a partisan issue. We have a difficult time understanding why anyone would oppose easier access to government data, which belongs to the public. Well, Scott didn t like being called out so he responded by accusing the Sentinel of being  fake news. The very liberal GJ Sentinel is attempting to apply pressure for me to move a bill,  Scott wrote.  They have no facts, as usual, and tried to call me out on SB 40 know as the CORA bill. They haven t contacted me to get any information on why the bill has been delayed but choose to run a fake news story demanding I run the bill. You may have a barrel of ink but it just splashed in your face. We have our own fake news in Grand Junction.. The very liberal GJ Sentinel is attempting to apply (more: https://t.co/VYmpfgM6X9 )  Ray Scott (@SCOTTFORCOLO) February 9, 2017Once again, a Republican attacked the media by calling them  fake news  in response to a story they don t like.As we have seen on the national level, news outlets have begun directly calling out Donald Trump whenever he refers to a media outlet as  fake news. But the Daily Sentinel is going a step further, and if they succeed, Donald Trump, Kellyanne Conway, and other Republicans should be more careful about what they say. Setting aside for the moment the mischaracterizations and mistakes in Sen. Scott s tweet, (though it is true we were not able to reach him about why he canceled the hearing) the concern for me is the allegation that the Sentinel peddles  fake news,  wrote Sentinel publisher Jay Seaton.  His tweet is patently, provably false. Worse, he made his false statement knowingly for the purpose of diminishing the only real asset this newspaper has: its credibility. Seaton is letting things cool down for the moment, but is planning on filing a defamation lawsuit against Scott.This would be a huge deal since the Sentinel would be the first news outlet to sue a lawmaker for calling them  fake news. Keep in mind that Donald Trump has repeatedly called CNN, the New York Times and other mainstream media outlets  fake news  on Twitter and during press conferences. So have other members of his administration in response to stories they don t like.Imagine if all of these news outlets got together and filed a massive defamation lawsuit against Trump.It would be monumental and Trump would be in serious trouble, too, because he would have to prove his  fake news  claims in court. Meanwhile, the media has demonstrated on multiple occasions that Trump is wrong whenever he accuses them of running  fake news  stories.In short, Donald Trump should really stop calling the media  fake news.  They have a case against him and if this lawsuit by the Daily Sentinel moves forward and succeeds, more lawsuits of this nature could be forthcoming and Trump would be the top target.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,14-Feb-17
 Trump Whines About ‘Illegal Leaks’ About His Administration’s Wrongdoings And Gets CREAMED (TWEETS),"Following Michael Flynn s resignation after he was busted lying about the nature of his conversations with the Russians, Donald Trump came clean with America: he admitted that Flynn had discussed sanctions during those conversations and pledged to launch an investigation into the full extent of his dealings with a hostile foreign power in some alternate reality. In this one, he threw a tantrum on Twitter because he s a child. The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?  Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2017That s right   the fact that we, the American people, found out that Flynn had been colluding with the same government that hacked our election on Trump s behalf and ran an aggressive propaganda campaign to discredit Hillary Clinton, is the issue. Not that it was happening in the first place. Not that Trump fired the acting Attorney General shortly after she warned him that Flynn had lied. To Trump, the real issue is that we are finding out what is going on.Ironically, he seems to be unaware that one of his guests at the Mar-a-Lago snapped photos of the guy carrying the  nuclear football  and named him on social media   or, of course, that all of his guests had a full view of secure documents as Trump perused them over dinner by the lights of his minions  cell phone flashlights.Bannon & Flynn used phone flashlights for Trump read most secure N Korea docs w/waiters serving. Maybe Rs can scream more about HRC emails https://t.co/e7Dj8CaH8M  Gene Sperling (@genebsperling) February 13, 2017The Verge recently published a video demonstrating how easy it is to hack a cell phone camera: The concern is a hot mic attack, in which a hacker uses the compromised phone to record private conversations. But as our demo showed, it s just as easy to compromise the camera, allowing the attacker to see whatever is in front of the phone,  the publication s Russell Brandom writes in an article on the North Korea dinner debacle.  That s usually not as useful, provided the target doesn t physically hold up the phone and point it at sensitive intelligence documents, but here we are. In other words, the only problems are Trump and his team, and the only concern of compromised intelligence lies with him and the people he selected to run our country into the ground.Naturally, Americans reminded him who is the boss:@realDonaldTrumpYour administration got caught breaking the law then lying about it.Flynn didn t lie to Pence.You lied to us.

Skeller85 (@skeller85) February 14, 2017The Intercept notes that Trump makes the lives of foreign spies so easy that they  must be bored :Tommy Vietor, a former National Security Council spokesperson for President Obama, pointed to another vulnerability exposed by the scene at Mar-a-Lago: the possibility that waiters at the club, who continued dinner service during the discussion of North Korea s missile test, could be recruited by foreign intelligence services.For a clue as to just how easy that might be, consider that the Palm Beach Post reported in December that Mar-a-Lago hires dozens of temporary foreign workers each year, using the federal government s H-2B visa program.It was not immediately clear where the foreign workers at Mar-a-Lago come from, but another club in the area told members that workers hired under the same visa program come from Romania, Ireland, and South Africa.Donald Trump represents perhaps the greatest danger our nation has ever faced   and it is up to each and every one of us to oppose him in every way possible.#Resist.Featured image via screengrab",News,14-Feb-17
 WATCH: Matt Lauer Just CRUSHED Kellyanne Conway’s Bullsh*t Defense Of Flynn And Trump,"Donald Trump s national security adviser Michael Flynn has resigned in disgrace, and Kellyanne Conway should do the same after this disastrous interview.While President Obama was still in office, Flynn contacted the Russian ambassador to talk about lifting the sanctions placed upon them in retaliation for interfering with our election process.This is a violation of the Logan Act, which bars citizens from negotiating with foreign powers.Trump was not in office yet, so Flynn was not yet in his official position either, which means he broke the law.Flynn also lied to Mike Pence about the contact and Acting Attorney General Sally Yates had warned Trump of Flynn s actions last month and warned him that Flynn could be blackmailed by the Russians.Trump would later fire Yates, but kept Flynn on staff despite the illegal actions and threat of blackmail.Then on Monday night, Flynn resigned. But Kellyanne Conway insists that Flynn had Trump s  full confidence  up until the very end when he all of a sudden changed his mind. I think misleading the vice president really was the key here,  Conway told Matt Lauer on the TODAY Show on Tuesday morning.  I spoke with the president this morning, and he asked me to speak on his behalf, and to reiterate that Mike Flynn had resigned. He decided that this situation had become unsustainable for him. But that was not good enough for Lauer, who proceeded to call Conway out. You re saying that was the straw that broke the camel s back, but the White House knew about that last month when the Justice Department warned the White House that General Flynn had not been completely honest in characterizing that conversation with the Russian ambassador. Lauer went on to remind Conway that the Justice Department further warned Trump that Flynn was a blackmail risk.Conway responded by repeating her previous statement and even admitted that Flynn was still present at meetings. Lauer was not amused. Kellyanne, that makes no sense! Last month, the Justice Department warned the White House that General Flynn had mislead them! And that as a result he was vulnerable to blackmail. And at that moment he still had the complete trust of the president? Conway then insisted that the media move on and stop reporting on the scandal.Here s the video via Twitter. That makes no sense.  @MLauer to @KellyannePolls while discussing Trump s former national security adviser Michael Flynn pic.twitter.com/94SaFlQJxo  TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 14, 2017This is a major scandal because it exposes the fact that Trump is incapable of controlling his own staff and that he will continue to trust his friends even if they are dirty. Trump s national security adviser was a threat to national security and Trump didn t do anything about it. Trump should have to answer for that and if he doesn t like it he should resign.Featured image via screenshot",News,14-Feb-17
 Hillary BRILLIANTLY Trolls Trump As His Fledgling Administration Plunges Further Into Chaos (TWEET),"No matter what you think of former First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State, and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton or her politics, there is one thing that cannot be denied: She would have been a competent president. However, thanks to a range of factors, Donald Trump beat her in the electoral college, and now we are stuck with the dangerous incompetence of Team Trump.The latest development after the three weeks of crazy that has been the beginning of the Trump regime is the fact that General Michael Flynn, Trump s now-former National Security Adviser, has resigned amid a flurry of chaos and scandal regarding conversations he had with a Russian official regarding sanctions before the Trump administration took over the White House.In an  I told you so  moment, Hillary weighed in on what was happening with Team Trump. This comes after one of Hillary s supporters, former Deputy Secretary of State Phillipe Reines, tweeted a snide remark regarding the fact that General Flynn and his son, Michael Flynn Jr, had participated in spreading fake news regarding #Pizzagate, a false story alleging that Hillary and her campaign chair, John Podesta, ran a child sex ring out of a Washington, DC pizza parlor. Of course this was not true, and absurd and ridiculous to anyone with half a brain, but some Trump supporters believed it wholeheartedly. This resulted in a man opening fire in the pizza joint, a popular family place called Comet Pizza.Hillary retweeted Reines, and added her own comment, thusly:Philippe's got his own way of saying things, but he has a point about the real consequences of fake news  https://t.co/a02sXiaHfp  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 14, 2017Of course, Hillary and Phillipe are right. Not only have these lies from Team Trump come back to bite them, but said lies had very real consequences. Keep calling them out, Hillary.

 Trump Official ADMITS He Is Collecting ‘Dossiers’ To Blackmail Journalists Into Submission,"Reality TV star Omarosa Manigault has found herself a pretty sweet position in the Trump administration as the director of communications for the Office of Public Liason   but like all of Trump s team, she is learning that the old adage involving loose lips and sinking vessels (like the Trump administration) applies to her current role.With General Flynn s resignation over his suspicious conversation about sanctions with one of Vladimir Putin s lackeys and all the other disasters Trump has caused, whined about, and made worse through his attempts to clean up his mess, the last thing he needs is one of his people revealing that his administration is collecting information they intend to use to blackmail the press but enter Omarosa.American Urban Radio Networks  White House correspondent April Ryan says that last Wendesday Omarosa threatened her outside the West Wing both physically and otherwise:Manigault, who is now a communications official in the Trump administration, got into a heated argument with a White House reporter just steps from the Oval Office last week, according to witnesses. The reporter, April Ryan, said Manigault  physically intimidated  her in a manner that could have warranted intervention by the Secret Service.Ryan also said Manigault made verbal threats, including the assertion that Ryan was among several journalists on whom Trump officials had collected  dossiers  of negative information.Manigault, a onetime friend of Ryan s, declined to address Ryan s accusations on the record, offering only this emailed statement:  My comment: Fake news!  She did not specify what she considered false.As we have learned by now, when the Trump administration cries  fake news,  the allegations are generally true. Despite Manigault s denials, multiple witnesses confirm that the altercation did take place, with one remarking that the Trump official s actions were  Secret Serviceable,  meaning that it was a situation in which law enforcement needs to intervene.This isn t the first time Omarosa has informed the public of the Trump administration s plan to deal with those they view as enemies. In November, Manigault told the Independent Journal Review that  we re keeping a list  of people who have defied Trump. It s so great our enemies are making themselves clear so that when we get in to the White House, we know where we stand,  she said at the time.If a Trump official admitting that the administration is keeping lists of enemies and compiling  dossiers  for blackmail doesn t concern you, then there is something wrong.Featured image via Getty Images",News,14-Feb-17
 Michael Flynn’s Resignation Letter Omits One CRUCIAL Fact While Also Kissing Trump’s Orange Ass,"Michael Flynn s sudden resignation in the wake of a growing scandal that he was in contact with Russia over the sanctions we slapped on them probably surprised absolutely no one   except perhaps those who think Donald Trump is perfect. Flynn recently admitted that he  may have  discussed those sanctions with Russia, and then, with the news that the Justice Department had already warned the Trump administration about him, everything just blew up.Fox News (of all outlets) published his resignation letter in its entirety, and it s not the letter of someone who knows he screwed up. It s the letter of someone who s still hoping that the White House will give him some favorable treatment. It s the letter of someone who s sucking up majorly in the wake of his fuck-up.It s the letter of someone who won t admit he was wrong in any way, shape or form. After claiming that his talks with Russia and other countries were simply to make the transition of power as smoothly as possible, he said: Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology. Leave out the  fast pace of events,  and  I inadvertently,  and you ve got an admission of wrongdoing. Otherwise, he s basically saying,  Yeah, I lied, but it wasn t my fault I lied. Then he says it s been his honor to serve the American people  in such a distinguished way,  after talking about his  integrity  in performing his duties throughout a 33 year-long military career. His career is distinguished, yes, but it s been forever tarnished by his behavior, even if he isn t willing to acknowledge that in his resignation.The end of the letter, though, is nothing but one big, long, sloppy kiss on Trump s ass: I am also extremely honored to have served President Trump, who in just three weeks, has reoriented American foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore America s leadership position in the world.As I step away once again from serving my nation in this current capacity, I wish to thank President Trump for his personal loyalty, the friendship of those who I worked with throughout the hard fought campaign, the challenging period of transition, and during the early days of his presidency.I know with the strong leadership of President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and the superb team they are assembling, this team will go down in history as one of the greatest presidencies in U.S. history, and I firmly believe the American people will be well served as they all work together to help Make America Great Again. Yeah, that really sounds like he s hoping they ll give him some kind of favorable treatment down the road instead of cutting him loose and disavowing him, or something. It is, in its way, a good resignation letter, but it just reeks of ass-kissing and  this wasn t my fault. Flynn is, we hope, just the first domino to fall in a corrupt administration that s intent on selling us out to one of our greatest enemies. Goodbye, and good riddance, sir.

 BREAKING: Russia Scandal EXPLODES In Trump Admin.; Top Russian Stooge Is OUT,"Donald Trump and his entire administration seem to be nothing more than Russian stooges. And no, this is not merely rumor; after all, even the intelligence community is so sure that the Kremlin has infiltrated Team Trump that they are withholding key intelligence from the White House. Now, it seems that things have gotten so hot that Trump s loyal and treasured national security adviser, Retired General Michael Flynn, has resigned.This move comes after a flurry of reports concerning Flynn s pre-inauguration contacts with Russian officials. At first, the Trump team   including Mike Pence   went on national television and gave the whole  nothing to see here  speech regarding the phone calls. Flynn even flat-out denied speaking about important matters, such as sanctions, with the Russians.Then, within the last few days, it was revealed that there were transcripts of the calls, and indeed, they reveal that Flynn discussed the sanctions that the United States had leveled against Russia in retaliation for interfering in the presidential race in order to help elect Trump. Apparently, Flynn lied to Pence about this, thus forcing Pence to lie to the American people. All of this seems to be too hot to handle for the Trump White House, so late Monday night, the news that Flynn was gone broke via CNN:CNN: Two sources tell CNN Michael Flynn has resigned.@SaraMurray @GloriaBorger  Shimon Prokupecz (@ShimonPro) February 14, 2017 Here is a tweeted copy of the resignation letter from Flynn:Breaking: text of Flynn's resignation letter pic.twitter.com/KGue1cJFzL  Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) February 14, 2017This administration is clearly compromised by Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin.

 Protesters BEAUTIFULLY Troll Jason Chaffetz After He Accuses Them Of Being Paid,"What is with the GOP accusing protesters of being paid to protest their events? Do they think it s impossible that so many people are actually upset? Maybe they re taking lessons from Donald Trump on that issue.Last week, Jason Chaffetz found himself on the wrong side of people who are angry that he attacked Hillary so aggressively, but won t even raise the question of investigating Trump for much worse transgressions. He told Salt Lake City-based Deseret News that he knew people were paid to try and bully and intimidate him at his town hall.All that kind of an accusation does is galvanize those who are protesting, and these people found a unique way to respond: They re sending him invoices for their appearances at his town hall. The invoice is circulating online and charges Chaffetz $100 per hour for  paid protest,  and two additional $50 charges for  being callously dismissed by representative,  and  being labeled out-of-state radical.

Democrats are in disbelief that they have nothing but flailing and screaming to defend this. I ll never satisfy their desire to bring down [President] Donald Trump.

While Canada s leader acted in a manner befitting his office (unlike a certain orange buffoon we know), he has been quite critical of The Donald in the past.Asked about Trump before he was sworn into office, Trudeau told reporters, there are things that we hold dear that the Americans haven t prioritized.  Then he explained what some of those things are: And I m never going to shy away from standing up for what I believe in,  he said,  whether it s proclaiming loudly to the world that I am a feminist, whether it s understanding that immigration is a source of strength for us and Muslim Canadians are an essential part of the success of our country today and into the future. Trudeau added that he hoped to nevertheless  have a constructive working relationship with the incoming American administration,  saying,  These are issues that are things we can have discussions on and respectful disagreements on with our neighbors to the south, if indeed we have to have disagreements on them. The last thing Canadians expect,  Trudeau said during his visit, is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves. Trudeau was polite, but he may be our greatest ally in opposing Donald Trump s hateful agenda   That s the fear expressed by right-wing vomit-bin and unofficial Trump propaganda outlet, Breitbart, anyway.Trudeau is everything an American President should be. Can we just, you know, surrender to Canada?Featured image via screengrab",News,13-Feb-17
" Trump Wants More White House Staffers, What He Wants Them To Do Is SHAMEFUL (TWEETS)","Donald Trump has just come up with a new way to make his failing administration even worse, and it s going to make most Americans sick to their stomachs.Trump is not only seeking to hire more horrible people to work for him, but what he wants these sought-after employees to do is even worse   he wants them to solely focus on his social media promotion. CNN s Jim Acosta reported this horrifying new addition to the Trump administration on Twitter:Seriously, the last thing this country needs is more people tweeting and posting from Trump s accounts; most of us have already had more than we can stand. While Dan Scavino has been almost singlehandedly managing Trump s tweets as the narcissistic POTUS comes up with them, having staffers to help him out will certainly allow him to cover more ground. Acosta reported even more staffing decisions up ahead: The White House is expected to make more high-profile hiring decisions soon as a search is under way for a new communications director. White House press secretary Sean Spicer is currently handling both jobs, roles that are typically carried out by two staffers. While more visibility and transparency isn t a bad thing under normal circumstances, most of us know that this is a horrible idea for Trump s administration. Trump has already been extremely reckless in his social media use   just take a look below at some of Trump s security gaffes from this weekend alone:Clearly, giving Trump more exposure is far from a good thing as he s sure to turn the highest office in the country into a circus. If anything, having more hands in his social media operations is only going to allow him to destroy America s future faster than ever, making us all look incredibly stupid at the same time.Featured image via Matthew Cavanaugh / Getty Images",News,13-Feb-17
" Trump Embarrasses U.S., Brags About Election Win In Joint Press Conference With Trudeau (VIDEO)","Amateur president Donald Trump met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday to speak in a joint press conference, and he thoroughly embarrassed the U.S. again by feeding his ego in front of the entire world. The topic of Syrian refugees was brought up by a reporter, and of course, Trump had to bring up his election victory. President Trump, you seemed to suggest that Syrian refugees are a Trojan horse for potential terrorism, while the prime minister hugs refugees and welcomes them with open arms,  a reporter asked.  Are you confident the northern border is secure? You can never be totally confident,  Trump replied. Trump heaped praise on Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly for doing a  great job  of deporting  very, very hardened criminals  so far, as reported by Talking Points Memo. That s what I said I would do. I m just doing what I said I would do, and we won by a very, very large electoral college vote,  Trump said.Trump went on to say that he  knew  he would win the election. That s an odd statement to make since he admitted to being surprised that he won after the election during his thank you tour following the election. I knew this is what people were wanting. That wasn t the only reason, that wasn t my only thing that we did so well on, but that was something that was very important,  Trump said.  I think that in the end, everyone is going to be extremely happy. And I will tell you right now, a lot of people are very, very happy right now. Watch:A lot of people are not  very happy right now  as Trump suggested. His approval rating is tanking like the Titanic. Before taking the oath of office, Trump s approval rating as president-elect was the worst in modern history, and it s gotten even worse since Inauguration Day. Trump s disapproval rating has risen 5 percentage points since just last week. Since his  election,  Trump has witnessed mass protests across the country. The Women s March on Washington, which took place the day after he was sworn in, garnered a far larger crowd than his inauguration. Nope, people are not  happy right now,  but he knows that. That s why he repeatedly brings up his election victory and most times, tries to claim he won the popular vote by saying that 3 million people voted illegally in the U.S. election. That s nearly the same number by which Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images.",News,13-Feb-17
 Trump’s Friend Snaps Pic With Guy Holding ‘Nuclear Football’ And Identifies Him On Facebook (SCREENSHOTS),"One of the guests at what Trump calls the  Winter White House    his private business in Florida  really got to feel the privilege associated with being able to drop $200,000 on a membership fee to gain access to the President on Saturday. Guests were treated to quite a bit of excitement when a call came in that North Korea had launched a missile and Trump read over confidential documents in full view of everyone as his white supremacist staffers held their cell phones  flashlights on it so he could see properly at the dinner table.Richard DeAgazio, one of the rich guests who somehow gets access to the President simply by paying him money, posted about watching Trump deal with the North Korea news   complete with photos of Trump reviewing information that is supposed to be secure.But that s not all DeAgazio posted! He also snapped a photo with the guy whose job it is to carry the  nuclear football.  Now the existence of the  football  is, of course, not a national secret. Hillary Clinton, for example, warned us that it is dangerous to place something so dangerous in Donald Trump s care. But DeAgazio made sure our enemies know who has it, what he looks like, and what his name is. This is Rick He carries the  football  The nuclear football (also known as the atomic football, the President s emergency satchel, the Presidential Emergency Satchel, the button, the black box, or just the football) is a briefcase, the contents of which are to be used by the President of the United States to authorize a nuclear attack while away from fixed command centers, such as the White House Situation Room,  he posted on Facebook along with a photo of Rick, whom he says is the Man. All it costs is $200,000 and literally anyone is able to get within inches of access to our nuclear secrets   an interesting fact given The Donald s constant stream of attacks on Hillary Clinton simply for using a private email server. This, of course, is a small matter when compared to Trump s friends exposing details related to our national secrets on social media in real time.I never want to hear about emails again. On the plus, we finally figured out what it takes for one of Trump s rich white buddies to be willing to touch a black man.Featured image via Facebook",News,13-Feb-17
 WATCH: CNN Host HUMILIATES Trump Supporter For Providing Laughable ‘Evidence’ Of Nationwide Voter Fraud,"One of Trump s biggest supporters just got their ass handed to them for having zero evidence of voter fraud.Donald Trump s lies about voter fraud imploded on Monday as CNN tore apart Kris Kobach, the man Stephen Miller cited when asked if he had evidence to prove Trump s claims.Miller repeatedly claimed that millions of Americans voted illegally in November to explain how Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. Miller specifically talked about New Hampshire, claiming that thousands of people from Massachusetts bused in to vote a second time in that state. Go to New Hampshire,  Miller said.  Talk to anybody who s worked in politics there for a long time. Everybody s aware of the problem in New Hampshire. Except that many former and current New Hampshire politicians from both parties have criticized Trump s claim.And when ABC host George Stephanopoulos asked Miller for evidence, he merely referred the media to Kansas Secretary of State and Trump supporter Kris Kobach.On Monday, CNN host Kate Bolduan confronted Kobach about Miller s claims. Miller says, look to you, sir, for the evidence,  Bolduan said.  Where is it? On election day 2016, 6,000 people registered in New Hampshire using an out-of-state driver s license,  Kobach claimed in response.  Of those over 6,000, just under 3,000   so just under half   used a Massachusetts driver s license. Now, some of those are going to be legit. They re going to be people who just moved to New Hampshire  but many of those will be out-of-state residents who voted in the state. What Kobach just said is a mere prediction. In a courtroom, it would be called conjecture because Kobach is making an opinion based on incomplete information. You truly do believe that thousands of people came in from Massachusetts to vote in New Hampshire on election day?  Bolduan continued in disbelief. We will have data at the end of the month [about] how many of those 6,000 people voted in both New Hampshire and in one of the other states,  Kobach said, admitting that he actually doesn t have evidence. He is only promising that he will have evidence at a later time, probably when whatever right-wing organization he is associated with provides their fabricated statistics.With no real evidence to support his claims, Bolduan pounced and slammed Kobach with reality. Mr. Secretary, wait a second. Stephen Miller, over the weekend, said thousands did vote illegally. Definitively saying that this actually happened. You re saying that there s going to be more data coming at the end of the month. So, do you have the evidence? Voter registration does not equal fraudulent votes. Kobach claimed that 3 million Americans are registered to vote in two states, which isn t illegal. Of course, Trump adviser Steve Bannon is also registered to vote in two states.Kobach then offered  proof  of Trump s claim by whining about CNN not covering the nine cases of voter fraud Kansas is prosecuting. Bolduan easily picked that  evidence  apart. You have nine cases,  Bolduan said.  Six guilty pleas, one dismissed, two pending. That s as of January 25th. Nine cases does not rampant widespread voter fraud make. A small minority does not make millions and millions of widespread, rampant votes in this country,  Bolduan continued.  What Stephen Miller and the president said over the weekend is this is exactly why they lost in New Hampshire. Not saying they were prospective cases, they were illegal votes. At that point, Kobach stumbled his way through the remainder of the interview as Bolduan countered his bullshit with facts at every turn.Here s the full smack down via YouTube.Donald Trump s voter fraud claims are a pathetic attempt to stroke his own ego because he can t handle the fact that he lost to a woman and is not a legitimate president. If he is really so concerned about voter fraud, he should call for a new election immediately. But he won t because he is full of shit.Featured image via screenshot",News,13-Feb-17
 Whoopi SHREDS Betsy DeVos’ Ignorance Of Public Schools And It’s GLORIOUS (VIDEO),"It can be said that having Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary isn t only a dumb idea, it s an absolute nightmare for public schools.In addition, DeVos, much like Donald Trump, should probably stay off Twitter if she s going to try to at all be taken seriously.Not only did the Education Department tweet out W.E.B. Du Bois  name incorrectly and leave it up, as seen here:Education must not simply teach work   it must teach life.   W.E.B. DeBois pic.twitter.com/Re4cWkPSFA  US Dept of Education (@usedgov) February 12, 2017But then DeVos herself asks this idiotic question:Day 1 on the job is done, but we re only getting started. Now where do I find the pencils? :) pic.twitter.com/0vRKF1opE9  Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVos) February 9, 2017Which for most people, including Whoopi Goldberg of The View, was enough to put them over the edge.Like most people aware of public school teachers, Whoopi laid into DeVos about that idiotic pencil question. Because if DeVos knew anything about public schools, she would know that public school teachers go into their own pockets and pay for school supplies for their students on their own.Whoopi also sent a message to DeVos saying that if she really cared about aiding the education of this nation and had an actual interest in making it better, she would use some of her own money (you know, the money she used to buy her the Secretary position) and get schools and teachers the funding they deserve.Watch here:Education Sec.

 REPORT: Chaos Reigns Inside The White House As Trump Considers Firing Priebus And Flynn,"Donald Trump can t handle the complexity of running the White House and heads are reportedly going to roll for it.It has now been over three weeks since Donald Trump took over the White House and he still can t deal with all the problems that have plagued his administration. Infighting, power grabs, and ineptness have created an atmosphere of paranoia and mistrust.Reince Priebus has done a poor job as chief of staff while Sean Spicer, whom Priebus supported for Trump s Press Secretary, has done an equally poor job by embarrassing himself and Trump every time he faces reporters at the daily press briefing.National security adviser Michael Flynn, meanwhile, just got busted negotiating with the Russian government over sanctions in violation of the Logan Act. Flynn lied about talking to the Russian ambassador prior to Trump taking over the presidency and the Logan Act specifically bars citizens from negotiating with foreign powers. The White House is showing not the amount of order that we need to see. I think there s a lot of weakness coming out of the chief of staff,  Trump supporter and Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy told CNN recently.Axios reports that many staffers are insecure because Trump only respects people who are personally financially successful, which is why he chose many Goldman Sachs executives and employees to work for the administration.A White House source also told Axios that Trump and his team have to put out  400 fires a day. Yeah, it s apparently THAT chaotic.The source further told Axios that Flynn is certain to be canned soon because he committed  an unpardonable sin  by making Trump and Pence look like fools.Donald Trump has no clue what he is doing and he only digs a deeper hole by pretending that he does. His ego is so fragile that he won t concede that he can t do the job. His advisers each have an agenda of their own and they are fighting with each other for Trump s ear. It also doesn t help that Trump s advisers are inept whenever the appear on television to defend their boss.Trump also has to deal with reports that Steve Bannon is basically calling the shots, leading many people to refer to Bannon as  President Bannon. That must really be bruising Trump s ego.Frankly, Trump only has himself to blame for the chaos in the White House. He actually thought he would be inheriting President Obama s White House staff and found out rather late in the game that he would have to hire his own. Furthermore, Trump didn t  drain the swamp,  he just hired actual snakes to make the swamp dirtier.Our country can t take four years of Trump and his minions in office. A lot of damage has already been done and in order to prevent irreversible damage Trump and his administration need to be ousted before our nations pays severe consequences for the mistake made on November 8, 2016.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,13-Feb-17
" Trump’s Ineptitude Causes HUGE Drop In Investment, Future Of Our Nation Is In Peril (DETAILS)","America s creditors are now thinking twice about investing in our nation because Donald Trump s policies have turned us into a bigger credit risk.On Election night, as the returns came in favoring Trump for president the stock market took a hit and the dollar dipped in value. It soon bounced back but markets around the world and in the United States are nervous about what will happen as long as Trump continues to push an economic policy that significantly lowers taxes on the rich, slashes regulations, boosts spending like never before, and antagonizes American and foreign businesses.Trump s escalation of confrontations with Iran and China, along with European fear of an invasion by Russia have also left the future of the world economy in doubt.Trump has been erratic, paranoid, and quick to whine on Twitter and has shown a willingness to attack businesses that make decisions he disagrees with.And Donald Trump s unpredictability is forcing foreign investors to stop investing in United States Treasuries.According to Bloomberg,Across the world, foreigners are pulling back from U.S. debt like never before. From Tokyo to Beijing and London, the consensus is clear: few overseas investors want to step into the $13.9 trillion U.S. Treasury market right now. Whether it s the prospect of bigger deficits and more inflation under President Donald Trump or higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve, the world s safest debt market seems less of a sure thing   particularly after the upswing in yields since November. And then there is Trump s penchant for saber rattling, which has made staying home that much easier.Bloomberg goes on to point out that  any consistent drop-off in foreign demand could have lasting consequences on America s ability to finance itself cheaply,  which means the cost of running the federal government could skyrocket and fall upon the shoulders of struggling working class Americans who will see their taxes rise as the wealthy escape their own responsibility for providing revenues to the government.And as Trump continues to initiate trade wars against China, Japan, and other nations, it could further justify foreign investors from investing in the United States.We could be looking at an impending economic catastrophe as long as Trump continues to make America a credit risk. He wants to double down on the failed trickle-down economic policies Republicans are obsessed with and if he repeals the Affordable Care Act, that will create further chaos as the wealthy pay less in taxes and the deficit increases. Our economy is primed to implode and foreign investors see it coming. Investing in America is too risky right now, and it is only going to get worse. And Trump is to blame.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,13-Feb-17
 WATCH: Morning Joe Hosts HORRIFIED By Trump Adviser’s Ignorance Of Constitution,"Donald Trump tried out a new minion on Sunday in what resulted in an embarrassing and terrifying appearance on all the networks.Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who helped write Trump s apocalyptic and negative inaugural address and the executive order that banned travelers from seven countries from entering the United States, appeared on the Sunday shows to press the same theme over and over again.Miller claimed that the judicial branch has no authority to stand in the way of Trump s national security agenda and that Trump is always  100 percent correct. We do not have judicial supremacy in this country,  Miller said on Fox News Sunday.  We have three co-equal branches of government. It s true that we have three branches of government, but the Constitution clearly made the judicial branch responsible for interpreting the laws and deciding what is and what is not constitutional.Last week, the Ninth Circuit Court ruled against reinstating Trump s executive order, a blistering defeat for his administration.The ruling caused Republicans to make a bill splitting the Ninth Circuit Court a top priority as punishment. And now Trump and his team are trying to undermine the power of the judiciary in retaliation.And that why Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski expressed horror on Monday morning.The Morning Joe hosts could not believe how anti-Constitution Miller was and that Trump actually praised him for it. It s so much worse than I ever thought,  Scarborough said after both reacted to Miller s performance by saying,  Oh my God. Scarborough then proceeded to inform Miller that courts have every right to question what Trump does and gave him a quick lesson about the Constitution. They will be questioned by the court   it s called judicial review. Alexander Hamilton and James Madison wrote about it in the Federalist Papers, it was enshrined in Madison s Constitution. Indeed, Article 3 of the Constitution has been the bedrock of our nation s judiciary since America s founding.Article 3 states:The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish  The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more states; between a state and citizens of another state; between citizens of different states; between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.In short, the courts have the final say about what is constitutional and what is not. Trying to undermine the power of the judiciary is a violation of the Constitution.That was the worst performance out of anybody,  Scarborough continued.  That was horrendous, an embarrassment. Go back and read the constitution. The White House has got to stop embarrassing themselves by putting this guy out there. Scarborough concluded that if Trump keeps trying to undermine the judiciary he ll be impeached.Here s the video via Twitter..@JoeNBC on Stephen Miller s weekend performance: That was horrendous and an embarrassment https://t.co/rE5Fxo8AF3  Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) February 13, 2017Donald Trump continues to get more dangerous to our democracy and Constitution every day.

 American Intelligence Agents Fear Giving Trump Intel Because The Russians Are Listening,"Donald Trump is clearly a threat to our national security and our intelligence agents know it.In order to keep America safe, American spies are now withholding intelligence from the White House because they don t want the Russians to know what we know.Throughout the campaign, Trump openly praised Vladimir Putin, who now has a puppet in the White House after helping Trump win the election.And Trump has been friendly with Putin ever since, refusing to believe our intelligence agencies who all agree that Russia hacked our political system and interfered with our election process.Because Trump trusts Russia so much, our intelligence agents do not trust Trump and certainly do not want to give him sensitive information that could end up in Russian hands. Our Intelligence Community is so worried by the unprecedented problems of the Trump administration   not only do senior officials possess troubling ties to the Kremlin, there are nagging questions about basic competence regarding Team Trump   that it is beginning to withhold intelligence from a White House which our spies do not trust,  NSA analyst Jack R. Schindler reported for the New York Observer.Most frighteningly, a Pentagon official told Schindler that  the Kremlin has ears inside  the White House Situation Room.That means the Russians are privy to America s most guarded secrets, and the official lamented that  There s not much the Russians don t know at this point. That is absolutely terrifying and demonstrates clearly why Donald Trump and his entire administration need to be removed from office immediately before all is lost.We are talking about critical intel that could prevent nuclear war or give the United States a heads up about what Russia is up to. If the Russians find out we know something about them because Trump gets the intel and discusses it in the Situation Room or with one of his team members who have cozy dealings with Putin, the United States would lose the advantage.And as Russia prepares for war against Europe, it has never been more important that the White House get the intelligence it needs. The problem is that Trump is inept and in league with Putin. So how does the United States military respond to Russian aggression if the so-called  Commander-in-Chief  is nothing more than Putin s puppet? By making Putin aware of the information we have, Trump would be putting our troops in danger as the intel becomes useless. None of this has happened in Washington before,  Schindler wrote.  A White House with unsettling links to Moscow wasn t something anybody in the Pentagon or the Intelligence Community even considered a possibility until a few months ago. Until Team Trump clarifies its strange relationship with the Kremlin, and starts working on its professional honesty, the IC will approach the administration with caution and concern. It s time for Donald Trump and his administration to be removed from power. The security and future of the United States is at stake, and as long as Trump is in office the country is less safe than ever before.Photo of Donald Trump by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.

 Even Donald Trump’s Inauguration Poster Has A GLARING Misspelling (IMAGE),"I can only imagine that the stack of resumes on Donald Trump s desk is full of spelling errors, which to the most anti-intellectual administration in recent American history, is certainly not a disqualifier, at least if we judge by the communications coming from the White House over the last three weeks.The horrendous spelling came early. During the campaign, Trump regularly misspelled words on his tweets. That hasn t changed. Shortly before Trump s inauguration, he tweeted about China, and managed to misspell the word  unprecedented.  He eventually fixed it, but it took nearly an hour and a half.More recently, though, Trump s education secretary, Betsy DeVos tweeted about W.E.B. Du Bois, but instead of spelling it the way the Civil Rights Leader and founder of the NAACP did, her tweet, which happened to fall during Black History Month, spelled his name DeBois.The department fairly quickly apologized, but not without misspelling  apologies.  Yes, that came from the department in charge of educating our children.In another embarrassing misspelling, this one a bit more tactile than a tweet, Trump s inaugural poster also has a misspelling:President Trump s official inauguration portrait offered by the Library of Congress had a glaring typo on it, social media users pointed out Sunday evening.The print of Trump, which was sold on the Library of Congress s website, includes a quote from the president   but misspells  too  as  to. No dream is too big, no challenge is to great. Nothing we want for the future is beyond our reach,  the quote reads on the poster.Source: The HillThe poster has been taken off the website, but not before some screenshots were taken.Is this a big deal in the overall scheme of things? Not really, but it does show a frightening trend within the Trump administration: no dedication to detail in a job where every single word matters. For example, it s been widely reported that Trump doesn t even read the executive orders he s pushing out on nearly a daily basis. He even signed away much of his power to the neo-nazi Steve Bannon.For the moment, Mr. Bannon remains the president s dominant adviser, despite Mr. Trump s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council, a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban.Source: GQIf that sort of sloppiness, from the office of arguably the most powerful man in the world, doesn t terrify you, then nothing will.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,12-Feb-17

It seems that over the last 50 or so years, black people have gotten much too uppity, so when Netflix announced the release of a series called Dear White People, which isn t supposed to be exactly flattering to white people and especially racist white people, they threw a fit and are canceling their Netflix memberships.Because they can be as cruel as they want toward People of Color, but if the People of Color call them on it, well, that s out of bounds. So, White Supremacists, taking a cue from their Supreme Orange Leader, came up with a protest Twitter hashtag, #NoNetflix.Netflix announced a new anti-white show (Dear White People) that promotes white genocide.I cancelled my account, do the same. #NoNetflix pic.twitter.com/2HIGqviLHj  Shia LeBaked  (@bakedalaska) February 8, 2017This is the type of anti-white bigotry that gets incited by @Netflix sponsored shows. #NoNetflix pic.twitter.com/gaozYZ6kyO  Shia LeBaked  (@bakedalaska) February 10, 2017Netflix is working with Code Red Production, peddling their anti-White garbage. #NoNetflix #BoycottNetflix pic.twitter.com/ZutCzDus0L  Boatsinker (@Clausfarre143) February 11, 2017To be fair, this is one of the show s writers, but after reading these tweets, I too hate white people and like Moore, I m one of them.Why I canceled my membership @netflix #NoNetflix pic.twitter.com/vQspcNM5Mi  trevr (@trevrc) February 9, 2017If you can stomach it, read this trash:retweet and like if you think this guy summed it up beautifully. #netflix #NoNetflix pic.twitter.com/Xf8OVC24Uk  Dwight Mann (@geno_philia) February 9, 2017Netflix.

 Twitter HILARIOUSLY F*cks With GOP For Tweeting Fake Lincoln Quote (TWEETS),"The trouble with quotes on the Internet is that you don t know if they re genuine. Or something. Today is Abraham Lincoln s birthday, and to honor him, the GOP tweeted out an image of the statue in the Lincoln Memorial with a quote:What a respectable way to commemorate one of the greatest presidents this country ever saw. There s just one problem: The quote isn t Lincoln s. It s most likely from a 1947 ad for a book by Edward J. Stieglitz. He, in turn, was given credit for the phrase in 1949.Former Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson also used that quote, but there s no evidence that Lincoln ever said it. And the GOP looks really stupid.The funny thing is that one could assume the general population wouldn t know whether the quote is Lincoln s or not. In the age of Google, however, one has to be far more careful about attributing quotes and anything else, because someone will inevitably look it up and make you look stupid if it s wrong.So Twitter decided to make the GOP look really stupid, and what they came up with has us rolling:                            Stop making fools of yourselves, guys. We re going to bust our ribs laughing at you for the rest of eternity give or take an eon.Featured image via screen captures",News,12-Feb-17
 Betsy DeVos Gets SKEWERED After Dept. Of Education Posts Embarrassingly Misspelled Tweets,"Donald Trump s Education Department is pathetic now that Betsy DeVos is in control, and this proves it.DeVos  first week as Secretary of Education has been terrible to say the least.First, she was blocked from entering a public school by protesters and ran away. Then she posted a tweet jokingly asking where the pencils are, which drew a sharp rebuke from teachers, who did not find her  joke  funny because they usually have to buy their own school supplies for their classrooms.And so, the Department of Education under DeVos  rule is off to a rough start, and it got downright embarrassing on Sunday as Americans watched in horror as the Education Department proceeded to post Twitter messages containing misspelled words.Seriously. This is the f*cking Department of Education we are talking about. Spelling should be in their wheelhouse. But because of Trump and DeVos, that skill has apparently been lost.In celebration of Black History Month, the Department of Education decided to recognize and quote W.E.B. Du Bois. It did NOT go well.Education must not simply teach work   it must teach life.   W.E.B. DeBois pic.twitter.com/Re4cWkPSFA  US Dept of Education (@usedgov) February 12, 2017That s right. DeVos and her team actually misspelled Du Bois  name. And mockery and outrage rained down upon them for it.Welp, this is a foreshadowing of what #BetsyDeVos is going to usher in @usedgov. FFS!

 Terrorist Group Openly Lauds Trump For Being An Idiot And Bragging About His Stupidity,"Trump keeps saying that  bad people,  a.k.a radical Islamic terrorist groups, are happy that he s been unable to keep immigrants, refugees and travelers from seven Middle Eastern countries from coming into the U.S. But that s not what makes them happy. What makes them happy is actually that Trump is in the White House. He s a bumbling idiot who s going to piss off so many Muslims that these groups feel they won t have any trouble recruiting and growing, and throwing off the shackles of the  oppressive West. Al Qaeda s leader in Yemen has already expressed his sheer joy at Trump s bungled raid there. Hezbollah has joined the fray, too, saying something that should be offensive as all hell to Trump: We are very optimistic that when an idiot settles in the White House and boasts about his idiocy, this is the beginning of relief for the oppressed around the world. One of the reasons they feel optimistic is likely the fact that Trump is busy pissing off the entire world, which will galvanize various groups into working together assuming enough of the world gets angry.There are squillions of theories out about why these groups hate us so much, such as the anti-Muslim propaganda that s been circulating here with growing frequency over the last 15 years. Many people the world over view that kind of propaganda as coming from our government, and now, with Trump, that view has been vindicated.Trump is a master of anti-brown people propaganda to the point where terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS have used him in recruiting videos. He s said  Islam hates us,  and claimed we would  wipe out Islamic terrorist groups.  Four Islamic non-profit organizations have rejected federal funding intended to help them fight radicalization because of Trump. They feel that both the funds and Trump himself merely promote hatred, fear and intolerance, and that he s declared war on Muslims.There s much more, too. Trump is pigeonholing Muslims as a naturally violent group that must be exterminated. It alienates Muslims of every stripe. So really, is it any wonder that Hezbollah or anyone else is happy that Trump was elected? He s helping their cause. Trump is making things more dangerous for us. He will never do anything that will make us safer.Featured image by Chris Kleponis via Getty Images",News,12-Feb-17
 REPORT: Ivanka Trump Took Kellyanne Conway To The Woodshed For Peddling Her Product Line,"Kellyanne Conway got herself into a world of sh*t when she decided to violate ethics rules on behalf of Ivanka Trump s business. Because now Ivanka is PISSED.On Thursday, Conway whined about Nordstrom dropping Ivanka s product line due to lack of sales and then she desperately begged Fox News viewers to open their wallets. They are using the most prominent woman in Donald Trump s life,  Conway began.  Using her, who has been a champion for empowerment of women in the workplace, to get to him. I think she s gone from 800 stores to a thousand stores, or a thousand places where you can buy. You can buy her goods online. Go buy Ivanka s stuff is what I would tell you. I hate shopping, I m going to go get some myself today. This is just a wonderful line. I own some of it. I fully   I m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online. And by promoting Ivanka s business, Conway violated Federal Code  2635.702, which specifically states:An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity, including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member .An employee shall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office to endorse any product, service or enterprise.Ethics complaints have bombarded Trump s administration ever since and Ivanka s business is now embroiled in a political scandal, which won t help sales.Despite apologizing to Donald Trump and apparently being forgiven, Kellyanne Conway still had to face Ivanka and the confrontation was reportedly not pretty.According to Politico, A source close to Trump said that his daughter scolded Conway for dragging her brand into an ethics mess and told her not to mention it again on TV. This was a continuation of a conversation that Ivanka Trump had with her father weeks earlier about leaving her business out of the politics, that Conway wasn t aware of. So Ivanka took Kellyanne Conway to the woodshed for hurting her company. And that s just another example of the chaos and infighting that has been occurring inside the White House since Trump took office. One wonders how long it will be before Kellyanne Conway gets fired. Because the way she has repeatedly embarrassed herself on television in defense of Trump, that day should be soon, especially if she keeps angering Ivanka.Featured image via Yana Paskova/Getty Images",News,12-Feb-17
 The Internet Rips Trump Adviser’s Face Off After Saying Sean Spicer Is Always ‘100 Percent Correct’,"Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller told ABC s This Week host George Stephanopoulos on Sunday that White House press secretary Sean Spicer is always  100 percent correct.  That s kind of weird since he literally fabricated a terrorist attack several times in order to defend Trump s Muslim ban. There is nothing Spicer won t lie about to defend the alleged president.Stephanopoulos said that Spicer mentioned  from the podium  that  the decision by Nordstrom to pull those products of Ivanka Trump was a direct attack on the president s policies  after the retailer pulled her clothing line due to poor sales.The ABC host noted that Sears and K-Mart decided this week to pull Trump s home furnishing lines from their websites. Is that a direct attack on the president s policies, as well?  Stephanopoulos asked. I m not going make a comment on that. I don t have any information on it,  Miller said.  I do want to say that Sean Spicer, as always, is 100 percent correct and that what he said is true and important. And I agree with it. He just said he has no knowledge of what happened but that Sean Spicer was correct. Welcome to the alternative-facts of the Trump administration. You had a case where somebody was treated unfairly. The president stuck up for a member of his family,  Miller continued.  And the White House counselor made a light-hearted, flippant comment that nobody would interpret as being what has been cast as right now by you and the media and others. The  flippant comment  Miller is referring to belongs to Kellyanne Conway in which she hawked Ivanka Trump s clothing line on the air while sitting in the briefing room.Watch: He also made a baseless claim about voter fraud which has been thoroughly debunked.Miller is trending on Twitter and he s being mocked over this crazy-time comments.I didn t realize Stephen Miller was a 12 year old boy.

 Mark Cuban Hilariously BURNS Trump For Attacking Him On Twitter (TWEETS),"Donald Trump just got his ass handed to him by Mark Cuban.On Sunday morning, Trump attacked Cuban for no reason, claiming that the real self-made billionaire is not smart to enough to be president and that Cuban backed him  big-time. I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn t interested in taking all of his calls.He s not smart enough to run for president!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017Of course, everyone knows that Cuban supported Hillary Clinton during the campaign, and unlike Trump, Cuban is an intelligent businessman who built his empire without a multi-million dollar head start from his daddy.Twitter responded by roasting Trump but everyone was really waiting to see how Cuban responded.Well, Cuban did, indeed, respond. And Trump is going to hate it.Cuban posted a message Trump wrote to him complaining about how Cuban talked about him on CNN and the message Cuban wrote in return.Trump called Cuban  nasty  and Cuban told Trump that he had hoped he would  dig into the issues  and do more than just run his mouth about what other people tell him. When you say there is a bubble, it sounds like you are winging it,  Cuban wrote.  Which also makes it sounds like your comments are based on who you talked to last. Which tells me you are getting bad advice. I get the big part of your base doesn t care about issue details, but to be President, to be this close, you have to know your shit. Cuban also suggested that he might run against Trump in 2020. I may go after that job someday and it could be against you,  Cuban warned.How soon they forget  . pic.twitter.com/VXcfnjj4qX  Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 12, 2017Cuban then followed up that tweet by letting everyone know that they can chill out since it s better for Trump to tweet than it is for him to try governing since when he does he fails miserably.I don t know. But isn t it better for all of us that he is tweeting rather than trying to govern ? https://t.co/953MuEdfeu  Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 12, 2017That is a truly sick burn.

 CNN Just TORPEDOED Donald Trump With Facts To PROVE He Lied About Them Again,"CNN is definitely sick and tired of Donald Trump calling them  fake news. During an interview with Erin Burnett on Friday, Bernie Sanders jokingly referred to CNN as  fake news  to mock Donald Trump. Sanders even made sure to let Burnett know that he was just joking and Burnett acknowledged that Sanders was just joking. Soon after, a technical difficulty arose as Sanders could no longer hear Burnett. CNN then went to commercial, and Burnett apologized to the audience and to Sanders for the issue and resumed the conversation.Here s the video via CNN.Well, Fox News claimed that CNN cut off Sanders in retaliation for his  fake news  joke. And then Donald Trump tweeted about it several minutes later and made the same claim.While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network. They said technical difficulties!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017That s when CNN proceeded to strongly fire back as Brian Stelter set the record straight by linking to the full video of the interview and call Trump out for lying.Untrue. Sanders was *criticizing Trump* for calling CNN  fake news.  You can see for yourself, all 11 minutes, here: https://t.co/qhtlb5Wo6Q https://t.co/AcwOiNHi0j  Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 12, 2017Stop me if you ve heard this one before. But @FoxAndFriends covered the Bernie  technical difficulties  thing at 6:40. Trump tweeted at 7:14 https://t.co/AcwOiNHi0j  Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 12, 2017And then CNN Communications issued a transcript of the interview as further proof that Trump is lying.@realDonaldTrump False. Transcript from @ErinBurnett intvu w @SenSanders. He was not cut off. Those are the facts. https://t.co/NzJNgdYSIX pic.twitter.com/AOFKLHUlGk  CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 12, 2017Clearly, Donald Trump once again got  alternative facts  from Fox News and repeated them as his proof that CNN is  fake news. But if he had simply taken ten minutes to watch the actual interview, he would know that Sanders was only joking, and that CNN did not cut Sanders off. It really was a technical difficulty and Sanders was able to continue the interview after the issue was fixed. But Trump didn t bother to do that, and he got his ass handed to him for it.Last week, Trump claimed that CNN host Chris Cuomo failed to ask a guest a specific question, only to get skewered by Cuomo and CNN Communications again for lying. Had Trump watched the very beginning of the interview, he wouldn t have humiliated himself.. @ChrisCuomo did address that point at the start of his interview. Those are the facts: https://t.co/JWJEAshv1y  CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 9, 2017Donald Trump won t bother to do simple research before he runs his mouth on Twitter, and that means he probably doesn t bother to do any research before making decisions as president.

 Trump Attacks Mark Cuban In Bizarre Tweet That Everyone Is Humiliating Him For Right Now,"Donald Trump made two claims about Mark Cuban that prove just how delusional and narcissistic he is.Apparently, Trump woke up this morning and saw the Dallas Mavericks owner on television and decided that deriding him on Twitter was more important than doing his current job.Trump claimed that Cuban was a  big-time  backer of his and that Cuban isn t smart enough to ever be president like him.I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn t interested in taking all of his calls.He s not smart enough to run for president!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017First of all, Mark Cuban backed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Election and repeatedly slammed Trump s business acumen and personality. Last time I checked,  big-time  backers don t support the other candidate and go on television to destroy you every week.Second, Mark Cuban is a more successful businessman than Donald Trump is and his vocabulary is higher than the fifth grade vocabulary Trump possesses.As usual, Twitter users were quick to humiliate Trump for his childish behavior.Wtf @realDonaldTrump?

 Meryl Streep Just HAMMERED Trump In Heartbreaking Human Rights Speech (VIDEO),"We can expect another angry, weeks-long tantrum from Donald Trump after Meryl Streep s speech at the Human Right s Campaign s 2017 Greater New York Gala Dinner on Saturday. Suddenly, at one point in the 20th century, for reasons I can t possibly enumerate in my two remaining minutes, the clouds parted. Something changed,  Streep said, speaking of the advances in civil rights we have made in recent history.  For the first time in 39,999 years, women began to be regarded as, if not equal, at least deserving of equal rights. Men and women of color demanded their equal rights. People of sexual orientation and gender identification outside the status quo also demanded equal regard under the law.  But then she turned her eye toward an orange, thin-skinned coward who threatens to undo decades and decades or work: Which brings us to now. We should not be surprised that fundamentalists, of every stripe, are exercised, and fuming. We should not be surprised that these profound changes come at a steeper cost than we originally though. If we live through this precarious moment- if his catastrophic instinct to retaliate doesn t lead us to nuclear winter, we will have much to thank our current leader for. He will have woken us up to how fragile freedom is. The whip of the executive, through a Twitter feed, can lash and intimidate, punish and humiliate, delegitimize the press and imagined enemies with spasmodic regularity and easily provoked predictability,  she told the crowd.Streep recently sent Trump into a rage fit after her speech at the 2017 Golden Globes when she went for Trump s throat over his decision to mock a disabled reporter s condition: This instinct to humiliate, when it s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody s life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose. Trump has been very stressed lately with his Muslim ban dying in multiple courts and all. We can probably expect The Donald to cheer himself up by attacking Streep again, which he seems to think is his job.

 Trump-Loving KKK Leader’s Bloated Corpse Pulled From Missouri Riverbank,"The body of Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard Frank Ancona, who disappeared from his home under extremely suspicious circumstances, was located the bank of a Missouri river Saturday. According to Washington County Sheriff Zach Jacobsen, Ancona s vehicle, which could be identified by the Trump bumper sticker according to his son, was located on Friday, but there was no trace of Ancona. Deputies responded on Friday and located the vehicle and secured it,  Jacobsen told the Daily Journal.  We left deputies at the scene and secured it overnight due to the loss of light. On Saturday morning we conducted a search of the area by foot by member of the Potosi Fire Protection District and the sheriff s office. We didn t locate much of anything in the woods, but we did locate evidence of a burn pile near Mr. Ancona s vehicle. The body was found by a woman who was taking her family fishing on the bank of Big River. We processed the scene and the body was transported by the Washington County Coroner s office for an autopsy to determine a cause of death,  Jacobsen says.  The body was positively identified as Frank Ancona and his family was notified. The details of the investigation that have been made public are interesting to say the least.According to Malissa Ancona, Frank s wife, he was last seen Wednesday morning when he was leaving for work. She claims that his employer had sent him across the state to deliver an auto part, but his workplace says he was not asked to do that. According to police, Malissa had initially been unreachable, so they stopped by her home where the found her with her son, Frank s stepson. Officers say they found a safe that someone had smashed with a crowbar. The contents had been removed, but Leadwood Police Chief William Dickey says police do not believe it was a burglary.Malissa had also posted on Facebook she was looking for a roommate at around the time Frank had  left for work.  She claims that he said he was filing for divorce when he returned home and would need help paying the bills.Interestingly, all firearms had been removed from the home   Malissa says Frank took them with him   except one, the gun he keeps on him at almost all times. Right now no one has been charged in his death, but that may change tomorrow,  Jacobson says.While this is certainly a tough time for the Klan leader s family, the Internet is responding as though Black Santa left them a gigantic Black History Month present. In public posts on Ancona s son s timeline, seemingly all the people who have watched Ancona s beliefs hurt people over the years came together to celebrate the slight downtick in the number of fascists in the world:                               Ancona will always be remembered by the world as the man who threatened to gun protesters down in the streets after Michael Brown was murdered by Ferguson, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson.Featured image via screengrab",News,12-Feb-17
 Trump Got Caught Doing Something REALLY CREEPY On Vacation In Florida (IMAGES),"Donald Trump s most recent secretive actions toward the press are raising a lot of eyebrows and concerns.While Trump is on taxpayer-paid golf vacation in Florida, the undeserving POTUS has made sure that no one will know what the hell he s up to. To symbolize just how transparent his administration is, Trump has blacked out all the windows of his  Winter White House  and banned the press from taking any pictures and keeping tabs on him.Here s what AP reported Jill Colvin saw in the press pool area:Here s another photo of this disturbing activity:PoliticusUSA obtained a White House pool report, which stated: The pool was escorted into the clubhouse after Trump and Abe were out of view and then led downstairs to a filing room, where we re told we ll be staying for awhile. The door and windows are covered with black plastic so we can t see out. Photographers were instructed not to take pictures on the grounds of a  private club. While reporters may not always be blessed with ideal conditions when covering the president, being stuck in a basement with blacked out windows is highly problematic. This couldn t possibly be any more shady. Basically, American taxpayers just sent Trump on a paid vacation, and he s literally hiding from them.This shouldn t really be a surprise, considering the fact that Trump has ditched his press pool a few times before and has expressed a distinct hatred for journalists and the press as a whole. However, what Trump is doing is highly unethical. When you run for the highest office in the country, you work for the American people now and your life is no longer private. What Trump is trying to do is keep American citizens in the dark, and it is beyond disturbing. This is not how presidents should act.Featured image via Drew Angerer / Getty Images",News,11-Feb-17

 U.S. Intelligence Says Details Of Russian Dossier Exposing Trump Are Checking Out (VIDEO),"When the bombshell dossier exposing Donald Trump s shady ties to Russia became public, it was easy to question the validity of the document. Although the golden shower accusation was the least important detail of the report, it certainly caught the attention of the public and was enough to make just about anyone say no way this can be legit. But according to CNN, U.S. intelligence agencies have been investigating the dossier and the document is gaining credibility because some of the details it contains are actually checking out.CNN reports:Law enforcement and U.S. intelligence agencies are continuing their investigation, but they say the corroboration of intercepted communications gives them a  greater confidence  in the dossier s validity.Naturally, Trump s team is already screaming  fake news    again. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told CNN,  We continue to be disgusted by CNN s fake news reporting.  He then called back to add this:This is more fake news. It is about time CNN focused on the success the President has had bringing back jobs, protecting the nation, and strengthening relationships with Japan and other nations. The President won the election because of his vision and message for the nation.Intelligence officials emphasized that the conversations they intercepted were between foreign nationals and came from routine information gathering. They also noted that some of the communications were from people who were known to be  heavily involved  in digging up dirt on Hillary Clinton to help Trump.U.S. intelligence agencies have still not come to any final conclusions regarding whether or not Russia really has any compromising information on Trump that they can use to blackmail him. They have also not confirmed any of the more  salacious  claims made in the dossier. In other words, they still don t know if Trump paid Russian prostitutes to  drain the swamp  for him.You see more on this here, via The Young Turks:.@CNN is reporting that an investigation into the  Pee-gate  dossier is gaining credibility. pic.twitter.com/j6CEHZJktN  The Young Turks (@TheYoungTurks) February 11, 2017Featured image via Andrew Harrer   Pool/Getty Images",News,11-Feb-17
" While Trump Tries Scaring Us Over ISIS, This Terrorist Group Is Growing Much Faster (DETAILS)","We all know Trump s paranoia over ISIS is making him do really annoying things, like ban travelers from countries that have never sent terrorism to us while ignoring countries that have. During his campaign, he also stupidly called on Bill Gates to  close up the Internet,  because the Internet is one of ISIS  primary recruiting tools. Yet, just like the rest of the right, he s completely ignoring a far more immediate terrorist threat, and it s growing much faster than ISIS.According to a new study from George Washington University, white nationalist groups (including Neo-Nazis, the KKK, skinheads and more) seem to be working harder and having far more success recruiting people online than ISIS. Over the last four years, the number of people claiming allegiance to these groups grew more than 600 percent   from about 3,500 people in 2012 to over 25,000 in 2016. ISIS worked hard, but these white nationalist types are much better at creating new terrorists.Image via George Washington UniversityThey re outperforming ISIS in most metrics now, including follower counts and number of tweets. ISIS  online activity has dropped dramatically since 2014, due in part to social media networks rooting out and suspending accounts. In that same time frame though, as shown above, white nationalist groups have grown considerably, and we hear silence from everyone.And where s Trump on this? We have to close up the Internet to stop the spread of terrorism, don t we?He s focusing on Islamic terrorism and alleged criminal activity among those he believes are undocumented immigrants. He s totally ignoring a threat that the FBI (and other law enforcement agencies) has been saying is a far more immediate danger. These groups surged following President Obama s election win, but aren t acknowledged as terrorists.In fact, whenever an attacker or potential attacker (like, oh, say, Wayde Lynn Kurt who pledged to assassinate Obama; or Dylann Roof, who killed 9 people in a black church in South Carolina) is white, even our media is likely to say they were a  lone wolf,  or something of that nature. Yet they re quick to jump on any attacker who shouts,  Allahu Akbar,  or proclaims allegiance to ISIS, as proof that terrorism is here.Worse, the report says that while increasing worry over ISIS is understandable, white nationalistic groups are able to watch and learn from ISIS  tactics both on and offline. So while we focus too heavily on Islamic terrorism, to the point of trying to keep even green card holders from seven countries out of the U.S., these groups watch Muslim radicalization on and offline, and adapt those techniques to suit their own movements.Trump s ascendancy to the presidency has only further galvanized these groups. His protectionist rhetoric and overt racism is exactly what these people want to hear. For instance, David Duke, the ex-KKK grand wizard, hailed his election, and also hailed his Muslim ban.Kevin MacDonald, another white nationalist, applauded Trump s plans to crack down on undocumented immigration, and for just generally saying what these people have been thinking forever.And we still sweep this stuff under the rug as people acting alone. They appear to act alone because these groups aren t nearly as centralized as ISIS. Also white nationalist groups don t generally claim responsibility for attacks the way ISIS does. But the movement is growing, growing quickly, and is far stronger on our home soil than ISIS, or any Islamic terrorism, is.Trump and his administration will continue to ignore this, and even feed it, putting us in grave peril.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images",News,11-Feb-17
 Dominican Newspaper Trolls Trump By Using A Photo Of Alec Baldwin (SCREENSHOTS),"Dominican newspaper El Nacional had a bit of fun with our comically inept President* when they  accidentally  used a photo of Trump s arch-nemesis Alec Baldwin instead of our orange-skinned wannabe dictator in a recent story.The story was regarding Trump s upcoming meeting with war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu following the United States  decision to block a Palestinian official from a U.N. appointment for fear it would hurt Bibi s precious little feelings. The United States was disappointed to see a letter indicating the intention to appoint the former Palestinian Authority prime minister to lead the UN Mission in Libya,  unqualified mess of a human being and U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley said. For too long the U.N. has been unfairly biased in favor of the Palestinian Authority to the detriment of our allies in Israel. This, of course, is sure to make Netanyahu happy prior to the meeting, where he and Trump are expected to discuss moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.The paper posted what appears to be a  tongue-in-cheek  photo correction, claiming that they were sent the photo by the Associated Press.It is unclear if this was an honest mistake or an  alt-mistake,  but one thing is for certain   Trump is not going to be happy when he sees this.Featured image via screengrab",News,11-Feb-17
 JK Rowling Is Absolutely Destroying Piers Morgan For Being A Sniveling Trump Groveler (TWEETS),"Washed up television personality Piers Morgan has had a rough 24 hours.Appearing on Bill Maher s Real Time, the Trump supporting former celebrity tried to defend Trump s Muslim ban and justify  giving Trump a chance.  The rest of the panel was not interested in appeasing Trump s bigotry. Most notably, Morgan got publicly humiliated by Australian comedian Jim Jefferies, who flatly told Morgan to take his defense of Trump and  f*ck off. It was beautiful.Here s the video:But Morgan s nightmare 24 hours were just beginning. Unable to let it go, Morgan immediately spent the next 12 hours screaming that he wasn t owned on Twitter. As you might suspect, yelling  I m not owned!  for half a day on social media almost assuredly means you were, in fact, owned.Enter J.K.

 WATCH: Republican Calls Town Hall Crowd ‘Children’ After They Boo His Lies About Affordable Care Act,"Republicans are still pushing the lie that the Affordable Care Act includes  death panels. Back in 2009, Sarah Palin repeatedly claimed that President Obama s signature healthcare law forces elderly people to go before panels to decide whether they get medical care or not. Other Republicans soon started making the same claim even though there is no such thing as  death panels  in the law.Politifact even rated the lie as their  Lie of the Year  in 2009.But even though Palin s  death panel  claim was declared a lie by fact-checkers in 2009, Republicans are still repeating it in 2017 to justify repealing the healthcare law that provides health insurance to 30 million Americans.During a town hall meeting held by GOP Rep. Gus Bilirakis in Florida on Saturday, Republican county secretary Bill Akins took the stage and repeated the  death panel  lie to the constituents who packed the room. Here s the problem I have with the Affordable Care Act,  Akins said.  Number one, there is a provision in there that anyone over the age of 74 has to go before what is effectively a death panel. Bilirakis  constituents immediately roared in disapproval. Yes, they do,  Akin continued.  It s in there, folks. You re wrong. The audience knew that Akins was lying and began booing him and calling him out. Akin insisted that the provision is real, but the crowd would have none of it.Akin then proceeded to insult the crowd by calling them  children. Okay, children,  he said, taunting them further.  Alright, children. Here s the video via YouTube.So, a Republican literally just insulted the constituents of a fellow Republican. Yeah, that s totally not going to bite Bilirakis on the ass when the next election comes around.Akin s response to the crowd demonstrates exactly what Republicans think of the American people, especially citizens who criticize them or dare to call them out on their lies.The fact is that there are no death panels in the Affordable Care Act. However, Donald Trump is trying to turn Medicaid into an actual death panel program and this is something Republicans in Congress apparently support.Trump s plan would turn Medicaid into a block grant program where each state gets a certain amount of money for healthcare. When the money runs out, states would have to decide who gets medical care and who doesn t. That s what a death panel really is.The Affordable Care Act, on the other hand, provides health insurance to millions of Americans to cover their healthcare needs.If anyone acted like a child during this town hall, it was Bill Akin for telling a baldfaced lie and then resorting to name-calling when he got called out for it. Americans are being treated like little kids by Republicans and Republicans should pay the price for it in 2018.Featured image via screenshot ",News,11-Feb-17
 BREAKING: Lithuania Warns That Russia Is Preparing For War Against Europe,"With their puppet firmly secured in the White House, Russia is now poised to take full advantage of it.Throughout the campaign, Donald Trump threatened to pull the United States out of NATO and suggested that America would not help defend our European allies against an attack unless they pay what amounts to a ransom. Trump has also gotten really cozy with Vladimir Putin, who launched an attack against Ukraine and seized the Crimea in 2014.And now that Putin has Trump as his puppet, Russia could probably march military forces throughout Europe without having to worry about the United States retaliating.That s certainly the fear of many Eastern European nations, including Lithuania, whose president is now warning that Russia is preparing for war on a massive scale.President Dalia Grybauskaite is concerned about an upcoming Russian military exercise with Belarus that appears to be a preparation for an invasion. We witness various threats growing and we are awaiting with concern the Zapad 2017 exercise,  she said.  At a time when many numerous and aggressive forces will amass together a demonstrative preparation for war with the West is coming. Indeed, Russia is building up its military and Belarus just so happens to border Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, all of which the Soviet Union once had control of behind the Iron Curtain.According to Newsweek,The security committee chief in Lithuania s parliament, Vytautas Bakas, said he believed Zapad 2017 would be the largest foreign military drill at his country s borders. According to Russia s Ministry of Defence, its heavy duty railway traffic to Belarus will increase by 83 percent this year, suggesting a transfer of a lot of cargo.If Russia is preparing for war against Europe the only power on Earth capable of stopping them is the United States. But with Trump fawning over Putin and perhaps owing a debt to the Russian leader for putting him in the White House, it s looking more unlikely that Trump would do anything to anger his new best friend. Trump has even considering loosening economic sanctions which will free up finances for Russia to use for their military buildup.Donald Trump is abandoning our European allies and that should worry every single American in this country. Because if Russia does launch an attack on Europe, it s going to be massive. And if Trump did decide to intervene, it will be late because he is an incompetent decision-maker. That means our military would have a disadvantage and thousands could die. It may even take a military draft, the very kind that Donald Trump himself dodged to get out of fighting for this country, to stop Russia. And that means even more American blood could be spilled in Europe because Donald Trump cares more about Putin liking him than he does about America, our allies, and our citizens.Featured image via Greg Baker-Pool/Getty Images and Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,11-Feb-17
 WATCH: Colbert HILARIOUSLY Portrays Trump As A Little Girl And The Internet Is Laughing Out Loud,"Donald Trump is totally going to lose his sh*t when he sees this.As we all know, Trump is insecure about the size of his hands and he has a major problem with women mocking him.So when Melissa McCarthy played Sean Spicer on Saturday Night Live last week it not only lite the Internet on fire, the skit enraged Trump because Spicer was played by a woman, which Trump believes makes Spicer look weak. You know, because Trump doesn t consider women strong, independent, and equal to men.Well, Late Show host Stephen Colbert took Trump s gripe and ran with it on Friday night. Evidently, he was not laughing because apparently, Trump thought a woman playing a man  makes Spicer look weak,  Colbert began.  First of all, I have met Melissa McCarthy and she could kick the ass of every man in that administration. And then Colbert unveiled the greatest trolling of Trump seen yet. If the president thinks a woman portraying Sean Spicer makes him look weak, then he s really not going to like this picture we made of a little girl pretending to be Donald Trump. And he s especially not going to like it when you retweet it at him with the hashtag #LargerHands. Here s the video via Twitter.Tonight!

 Trump Outrageously Refers To Elizabeth Warren As ‘Pocahontas’ During Meeting With Senators,"This is totally unpresidential behavior.Throughout the campaign, Donald trump repeatedly attacked Senator Elizabeth Warren by calling her  Pocahontas  just because Warren has Native American ancestry.Warren fired back on multiple occasions and often destroyed Trump to the point where he stopped attacking her.Trump s nasty attacks on Warren were outrageous during the campaign, and they are even more outrageous now that he occupies the White House as the so-called  President of the United States. During a meeting with Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday, Trump brought up Warren s effort to read a letter by Coretta Scott King to the Senate in which King condemned Jeff Sessions  racism and voiced her opposition to his nomination for a federal judgeship back in 1986.As Warren tried to read the letter, Mitch McConnell silenced her and Republicans voted to basically censure her because they claim the letter impugned Sessions   character.  You know, because calling out a racist has somehow become a bad thing in our society.Politico reports,According to participants in Thursday s meeting, Trump referred to Warren several times as  Pocahontas,  the moniker he gave her during his campaign, and told the Democrats he was glad Warren is becoming the face of  your party. Seriously. Trump actually referred to a sitting United States Senator as  Pocahontas,  which at this point should be considered a racial slur the way he is using it. Republicans apparently had no problem with Trump s disgraceful attack on Warren.Trump is no longer a bombastic political candidate trying to get attention. He is the f*cking president now and this kind of behavior is embarrassing and stains the dignity of the office.Make no mistake, Donald Trump not only owes Warren and the Democratic Party an apology, he owes America an apology.This kind of behavior is intolerable and he should be ashamed of himself.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,11-Feb-17
 White House DELETES Key Parts Of McClatchy Story On Trump’s Muslim Ban In Press Release,"The White House, still trying to make Trump look like he s perfect, blasted out a press release containing an article from McClatchy. Titled  Trump Is Not The First President To Ban Foreigners. So Why Is This Time Different?  they removed several full paragraphs detailing out the problems legal and otherwise with the Muslim ban.What remains is a benign story that makes it sound like McClatchy agrees that Trump is just doing what every other president did.Sean Spicer s office put the first six paragraphs of the story in, then an ellipsis, indicating that some material had been removed from the original story. Two more paragraphs later, another ellipsis, two paragraphs after that, another ellipsis, and an ellipsis at the end. While one could say that they did that due to available space, they literally removed everything that was critical of Trump, and left only the parts that weren t. That makes it a little harder to justify removing material because,  We ran out of space. Four of the missing paragraphs read:A flurry of lawsuits was immediately filed after Trump s order on behalf of immigrants detained or barred from entering the United States. U.S. District Judge James Robart, a Republican appointee, temporarily blocked the order from taking effect on a nationwide basis Friday following a half-dozen rulings by other federal judges that had backed more limited challenges. Such a temporary stay is granted generally only if a judge believes that side will prevail on the merits of the case, according to legal experts.They say that while Trump s executive order may rely on the same law as his predecessors , it differs from theirs in two important ways.First, it s much broader, banning all people from multiple countries, including those whose status had already been determined. Second, the order could be deemed unconstitutional because it discriminates against people based on their religion; the order calls for special consideration for followers of minority religions from the affected countries, a certain reference to Christians.The difference with Trump s order, said Erin Corcoran, an immigration law professor at the University of New Hampshire Law School, is that usually presidents cite more specific, immediate national threats than Trump s order did and target those who may come to the United States in the future, not those who already have legal status or are en route.The third ellipsis in the press release omits these paragraphs:Steve Legomsky, who served as senior counsel to the secretary of homeland security on immigration issues and as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and emeritus professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis, said Trump used the power in  a very different way than ever before  in part because he didn t isolate a subcategory of people.Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, an Obama appointee who was to serve until Trump s nominee to lead the Justice Department was installed, was fired after she refused to enforce his executive order because she felt it was intended to disadvantage Muslims. I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right,  Yates said in a letter.  At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful.Previous presidential orders didn t draw court challenges or trigger such a major national debate as Trump s order.And the ellipsis at the end omits this:Harold Koh, a former legal adviser at the State Department who s now an international law professor at Yale University, said, however, that the courts would likely narrow the order as the litigation went on. It s a mark of how this process has been going,  he said.  You could end up having one that s a shadow of the original order. All of that highlights the major differences that exist between this order and others that past presidents have issued. Any evidence that these seven countries represent a specific threat to the U.S. is being kept under tight wraps. In fact, the Department of Justice told the 9th Circuit that the president had intel that nobody else has, and made his decision based on that.They did not provide that intel to the court, though, despite the fact that courts often have to review classified info to make a proper ruling on a case. There are even rules and regulations in place to govern that kind of thing.Right now, Trump says that he s considering several options for the Muslim ban, including appealing to the Supreme Court and just issuing a new order. In fact, White House lawyers (surprise, surprise) are supposedly drafting a new order that they say will better comply with the law.The White House s press release does include links to McClatchy s story, but they re probably banking on people not clicking the links, or maybe hoping people don t understand what they re reading. Regardless, the dishonesty of this administration continues unabated.Featured image by Andrew Harrer-Pool via Getty Images",News,11-Feb-17
 Two More Stores Drop Trump’s Merchandise; They Know He’s Toxic,"There s a good chance that you haven t been inside either a Kmart or a Sears in decades. Most Americans haven t, which is why the brands (both owned by Sears) are in trouble.On Thursday, they might have had some inspiration, though. Nordstrom dropped their line of Ivanka Trump clothing and jewelry brand and despite a bitter tweet from Ivanka s father, their stock surged.My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person   always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017This decision made Trump so furious that he sent his spokesperson, Kellyanne Conway, to make a completely unethical sales pitch for Ivanka. Go buy Ivanka s stuff, is what I would tell you,  Conway said.  It s a wonderful line. I own some of it. I fully   I m going to just, I m going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online. She allegedly received a slap on the wrist, but she denied it, saying that  POTUS supports me. So, both Kmart and Sears, which both carry Trump Home items, have followed the high-end department store s lead and are dropping the Trump name altogether. As part of the company s initiative to optimize its online product assortment, we constantly refine that assortment to focus on our most profitable items,  a Sears Holdings spokesperson told Business Insider.  Amid that streamlining effort, 31 Trump Home items were among the items removed online this week. Products from the line are still offered online via third-party Marketplace vendors. While you can still find some items for Trump home and some shoes in Ivanka s line on their third-party part of their website, here s what happens when you search the store part of Kmart s website.And here s Sears:No doubt, Trump will eventually flag them as failing brands, and there s more than a grain of truth to that, but a bigger failing brand is Donald Trump. Just three weeks in, most Americans think he s doing a horrific job and nearly half think he should be impeached.As of the time this post was written, there was still no response from Trump, but he s busy mortifying the Japanese Prime Minister. Besides, Trump s most petulant tweets don t typically come till around 3:00 AM.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.",News,11-Feb-17
" Instead Of The Middle East, Trump Sent His Terrorism Taskforce To The Midwest; Why?","Donald Trump has no real platform other than be afraid, be very afraid. In Trump s imaginary world, we are all about to be wiped out by terrorists, but not the gun toting right-wing Trump follower type. No, we re all about to be killed by green card holding people from countries from the Middle East, but not actually from the countries that have ever attacked us. Earlier in the week, Trump s Press Secretary said this: I don t think it should be any surprise that the president, when it comes to rooting out radical Islamic terrorism, which is what that initially was supposed to be focused on, he is going to make sure that that is a major focus of his   keeping this country safe,  Spicer said.Source: OPBIf that s the case, then why the hell is the FBI terrorism task force worried about some peaceful protesters in the Midwest?The Guardian reports that the Trump administration has its FBI terrorism task force harassing people who are protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, instead of working to protect the lives of, you know, the American people. Instead, Trump seems to be redefining the word terrorism to fit anyone who interferes with his corporate or personal agenda. In this case, it s people who might interfere with oil company profits. The idea that the government would attempt to construe this indigenous-led non-violent movement into some kind of domestic terrorism investigation is unfathomable to me,  said Lauren Regan, a civil rights attorney who has provided legal support to demonstrators who were contacted by representatives of the FBI.  It s outrageous, it s unwarranted   and it s unconstitutional. Source: The GuardianNot only is this about enriching his buddies, but there is apparently a direct conflict of interest.Trump, a former investor in Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based firm behind the pipeline, took executive action in his first week in office to expedite the project. On Wednesday, workers began drilling to complete the pipeline across the Missouri river.There is so much that s disconcerting about this. Three days after a right-wing Trump supporting actual terrorist shot up a mosque in Canada, Trump removed any mention of right-wing terrorism from the website. Instead, he said he wanted to focus strictly on Islamic terrorism. So where exactly do protesters in the Midwest, many of whom are Native American fit in? It s simple, they don t. Trump is creating a new police state. We are either with him or against him and if we are against him, well, we too could be called terrorists. Oh, and did I mention that he wants to torture terror suspects?Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images.",News,10-Feb-17
 The Federal Election Commission Just Told Trump They’re DONE With His ‘Voter Fraud’ Lies,"Trump is still beating his  widespread voter fraud  drum, and it hasn t escaped the notice of the Federal Election Commission. Now it seems their frustration has overflowed, because one of the commissioners finally demanded that Trump produce his evidence. Ellen Weintraub, the commissioner in question, issued a formal statement on the matter after Trump told the Senate that thousands of people were bussed from Massachusetts to New Hampshire on Election Day.Apparently those people who were bussed to New Hampshire to vote against him are why he and Kelly Ayotte lost. Weintraub didn t mince words in her statement. She said: The scheme the President of the United States alleges would constitute thousands of felony criminal offenses under New Hampshire law The President has issued an extraordinarily serious and specific charge. Allegations of this magnitude cannot be ignored. She s right   if there really is this kind of voter fraud going on, we need to know. The proper authorities need to know so they can begin investigating and prosecuting those responsible, and so the states can overhaul their election laws to prevent this from happening again.Trump, however, refuses to release his evidence, most likely because he doesn t have any. Knowing President Asterisk, the evidence is people who look like they can t legally vote were voting, and also that he lost that state (and the national popular vote), which just can t possibly have happened.The White House has already made it clear they ll stand behind Trump. Sean Spicer even said: The president does believe [there is widespread fraud]. It s a belief that he s maintained for a while, a concern that he has about voter fraud. And that s based on information that s provided. What information? That s what Weintraub wanted to know when she went on to stick it to Trump on that issue at the end of her statement: I therefore call upon President Trump to immediately share his evidence with the public and with the appropriate law-enforcement authorities so that his allegations may be investigated promptly and thoroughly. That will never happen, because there is no evidence to provide.

 Even Indiana’s Republicans Are Trying To Erase Any Evidence Pence Ever Existed,"While the entire nation is struggling with the question of who is worse, Donald Trump or Mike Pence, the state of Indiana is thrilled to be rid of the right-wing conservative Pence who was their governor until just a few weeks ago, and they re doing everything to erase his legacy and all of this is being orchestrated by the replacement that Pence picked.Governor Eric Holcomb was chosen by Pence as his lieutenant governor. Pence has often said that he s  a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.  Holcomb, on the other hand is definitely a Christian, but he s a lot more pragmatic and frankly, next to Pence, anyone seems moderate, well, except perhaps the man who currently occupies the Oval Office.In just these last three weeks, Holcomb has cancelled a contract that would have leased cellphone towers to an Ohio company which would have left Indiana residents to foot the bill for construction projects.He also pardoned a wrongly convicted man who served nearly two decades in prison.Holcomb also pardoned Keith Cooper, who was wrongfully convicted of robbery nearly 20 years ago, and declared a disaster emergency for an East Chicago neighborhood where residents have been forced to relocate because of lead contamination.Pence had declined to pardon Cooper before leaving office, insisting that he exhaust his legal options despite resounding evidence of his innocence. Pence s refusal to exonerate the 49-year-old Chicago man came despite a pardon recommendation from the Indiana Parole Board and an online petition urging Pence to clear Cooper s name that had collected more than 100,000 signatures.Source: IndyStarWhile Holcomb hasn t exactly turned Indiana into a liberal haven, he does support a local needle exchange. Pence didn t. Pence preferred to take the see no evil approach and pretend that if we pray hard enough and disapprove firmly enough, people won t do drugs and they won t get sick from sharing needles. That doesn t work. To be fair, though, Pence did eventually succumb, but he still opposed giving local officials the authority to enact such an exchange.Right before he left office, Pence vetoed two bills. One gave university police departments (you know, the ones who are so often charged with investigating sexual assaults and hate crimes) total secrecy and the other prevented the state from establishing stronger environmental regulations than the feds without the General Assembly s approval. Both vetoes were overridden.House Minority Leader Scott Pelath, D-Michigan City, called the turn away from Pence s policies  fascinating. The Mike Pence legacy came to a very quick end today, probably the shortest one in Indiana gubernatorial history,  he said.  We just saw his final two vetoes overridden. Gov. Holcomb made the very common sense decision to address the East Chicago lead problem, which has been our own Flint (Mich.) in the making. He pardoned an innocent man which seems basic human decency. And he allowed that bicentennial cellphone tower deal to die a cow s death here in the Hoosier state. Residents of Indiana aren t exactly hopeful that they ll turn blue, but it s interesting that Trump s (and Pence s) coattails seem to be non-existent, just a few weeks into the the administration. Trump is no leader and even other Republicans are beginning to see that.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images ",News,10-Feb-17
 The Look On The Japanese Leader’s Face After Meeting With Trump Says Everything (VIDEO),"Alleged president Donald Trump met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinz  Abe and the former reality show star showed the world what an amateur he is. Welcome  to the very famous White House,  Trump told Abe in his opening statement during the joint press conference. Abe was very polite and humble during the exchange. Trump told Abe that since the inauguration he s  learned tremendous things. Trump said that includes information about threats to national security. Trump said that that information is something  that you could only learn, frankly, if you were in a certain position   namely, president. Polito reports that Trump also said at the end of the press conference that they re good friends but if that  changes  he ll  let you (reporters) know. Trump said he and Abe have already  developed a great friendship,  citing their past meeting inside Trump Tower and their interaction earlier Friday.  When I greeted him today at the car, I was saying   I shook hands, but I grabbed him and hugged him because that s the way we feel,  Trump said.  We have a very, very good bond. Very, very good chemistry. I ll let you know if it changes, but I don t think it will. The two shook hands, then the Prime Minister turned his head to the side with a pained look on his face. Abe did a semi-eyeroll before getting up from the chair.Abe s facial expression is ? pic.twitter.com/etYaiNH6vp  Brenna Williams (@brennawilliams) February 10, 2017We re sure Abe has seen Trump s Twitter timeline where just this morning he slammed the federal appeal court s ruling against his controversial travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries. Trump should have welcomed Abe to the  infamous  White House instead. Trump is just three weeks into the job and his administration is plagued with scandals. Michael Flynn, his national security adviser, is under fire for potentially breaking the law after reports late Thursday noted he discussed sanctions against the Kremlin with the Russian ambassador in December, despite the administration s past denials. Kellyanne Conway violated ethical guidelines by hawking Ivanka Trump s clothing line on Fox & Friends. She did that while seated in the White House briefing room. And that s just the short list.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News,10-Feb-17
 POLL: Most Trump Supporters Say Fake ‘Bowling Green Massacre’ Justifies Muslim Ban,"Did you know that people who support Donald Trump s unconstitutional Muslim ban are idiots? This isn t just a flippant remark about them; there s evidence   like the fact that most of them think the Bowling Green Massacre, which did not happen, completely justifies Trump s executive order.A new report from Public Policy Polling found that most Americans   48 to 43 percent   view the  travel ban  as targeting Muslims , and only 22 percent of Americans support that position. In fact, the phrase  one would have to be an idiot to support the Muslim ban  is now more true than ever. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:  the Bowling Green massacre shows why we need Donald Trump s executive order on immigration?  respondents were asked, with 57 percent disagreeing and only 23 percent backing that position.The low number of Americans who still somehow think the Bowling Green Massacre is real is positive   but when PPP looked at numbers among Trump supporters, they found that more than half view the Massacre That Didn t Happen as justification for Trump s ban:66% of Americans consider the United States to be a safe country, to only 23% who consider it unsafe. Perhaps as an outgrowth of that sentiment only 45% of voters support Trump s Executive Order on immigration, to 49% who are opposed to it. Among those who do support it you have to wonder how well thought out their position is- by a 51/23 margin Trump voters say that the Bowling Green Massacre shows why Trump s immigration policy is needed. By a 48/43 spread, voters do think that the intent of the Executive Order is to be a Muslim ban. And just 22% support a Muslim ban, to 65% who are opposed.Trump is likely sweating bullets, as the poll also reveals that almost half   48 percent of Americans   want to see him impeached. His henchmen and women are growing steadily more unpopular too. 47 percent of Americans (compared to 34 percent who like her) find Kellyanne Conway to be detestable, 41 percent (32% like him) are dissatisfied with Sean Spicer s performance. A whopping 49 percent (compared to 27 percent) don t like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and 72 percent hate Trump s best friend Vladimir Putin. In fact   a sign of how desperate things have gotten   more Americans (38 percent to 30 percent) say they would rather see Mike Pence as President than Trump. Hillary Clinton still wins in that regard, 49 percent to 45 percent.Even worse for Trump is the demographics of those polled. Only 39 percent of respondents identify as Democrats while 60 percent say they are Republicans or Independents, the exact groups Trump courted when he was running for President. In other words, there s no claiming that this poll was loaded with Democrats for Trump fans.Donald Trump said during the election that he loves the  poorly educated,  but he might as well have said stupid. Though Kellyanne Conway has used the Bowling Green Massacre in her scaremongering numerous time and ultimately admitted she lied about its existence, The Donald s supporters still take it as gospel. They ve gone from  alternative facts  to  alternative reality. featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla)/screengrab",News,10-Feb-17
 Betsy DeVos Asked A Dumb Question On Twitter And Got Her A** Handed To Her By Teachers,"Donald Trump s Education Secretary is off to a terribly embarrassing start.Just a day after being confirmed by the Senators she paid for after Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote, Betsy DeVos is already proving how ignorant she is about teaching and education.After her first full day in the position, DeVos posted a tweet about it and then joked about not knowing where the pencils are, which is pretty damn insulting to teachers since they usually have to buy their own pencils and other supplies.Day 1 on the job is done, but we re only getting started. Now where do I find the pencils? :) pic.twitter.com/0vRKF1opE9  Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVos) February 9, 2017Understandably, teachers and their supporters were pretty pissed off about DeVos  question and they absolutely trashed her for it in response.@BetsyDeVos not in the thousands of public schools that can barely afford supplies.

 Trump And His ‘Law And Order’ AG Sign Executive Orders Giving Cops Power To Shoot Black People,"Police violence against people of color is a huge problem in America. The worst part of it is that these people almost never even make it to trial, much less get convicted. It s a horrific pattern of abuse and state-sanctioned murder that seems to have no end in sight. Well, tragically, under Donald Trump and his new racist Attorney General Jeff Sessions, things are about to get a whole hell of a lot worse.As soon as Sessions was sworn in, he stood with Trump as they announced three new executive orders giving cops even more power to murder with impunity and without consequence. Citing the  threat of rising crime  and  public safety  as his justifications, Trump just signed the death warrants of many more people of color at the hands of police. Trump says of the orders: I am directing the Department of Justice to reduce crimes and crimes of violence against law enforcement officers. It s a shame, what has been happening to our great, our truly great, law enforcement officers. That is going to stop today. Trump went on to basically threaten people with the orders, saying he was sending a  clear sign  to anyone who might put a toe out of line. He said to the would-be criminals: Your day is over. A new era of justice begins and it begins right now. One of the documents is said to define new federal crimes, and increase penalties for existing federal crimes, in order to prevent violence  when it comes to cops getting shot. Of course, they had nothing to say regarding the scores of people who are killed by cops with no justification whatsoever. To compare, 2016 saw 135 cops killed, while 968 people were killed BY cops. So, yeah, the real problem here is violence, sure, but it s not against the police.Trump and Sessions know good and damn well who they are targeting here. It s not people who look like them or their kids. It s people of color who are often stopped by police for no good reason whatsoever.Let s face it   this will lead to more murder by cop and mass incarceration of people of color, which is, of course, exactly what racists like Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions want.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,10-Feb-17
 Trump Embarrasses Himself By Calling Accurate New York Times Story ‘Fake News’,"Donald Trump posted his most embarrassing attack on the New York Times yet on Friday.Proving once again that he really should think before he tweets, Trump reacted to a New York Times article that accurately reported that he hadn t spoken to Chinese President Xi Jingping since November 14th.Ever since Trump took a phone call from Taiwan, and basically treated Taiwan like a legitimate nation, China has not been happy. It has been American policy for decades that the president does not communicate with Taiwan because China considers Taiwan part of the real China.The  One China Policy  has been a crucial agreement between China and the United States, but Trump blew that all to hell with a single phone call and has been escalating confrontation with China ever since.The New York Times published a story on Thursday before Trump spoke with China s president to end the silence between them.Again, let s be absolutely clear. The new York Times published this story BEFORE Trump talked to Jingping. Once the Times learned of Trump s phone call, the story was updated to reflect the new information. However, it does not change the fact that up to that point, Trump had, indeed, not spoken with Jingping since November.But Donald Trump is not much of a reader, so instead of reading the updated version, he caught the older version of the story and promptly lost his shit on Twitter over it.The failing @nytimes does major FAKE NEWS China story saying  Mr.Xi has not spoken to Mr. Trump since Nov.14.  We spoke at length yesterday!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2017Yeah, this is pretty damn embarrassing and the Internet let Trump know it.@realDonaldTrump Subscriptions to the New York Times have doubled since you announced your candidacy.

Ben Rachinger (@BenSRachinger) February 10, 2017Seriously, Trump could done a simple search to find the updated version of the story but he is so petty and thin-skinned that he immediately lashed out instead of getting all the facts.And the fact is that prior to their conversation yesterday, Trump had not spoken to Jinping since November 14th, meaning the New York Times article was accurate and they continued to be accurate when they updated the story.Trump owes the New York Times a public apology.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,10-Feb-17
 WATCH: Trump Education Minion Betsy DeVos Runs Away After Being Blocked From Entering Public School,"Donald Trump s Education Secretary found out how hated she is on Friday.Betsy DeVos bought her way onto Trump s Cabinet earlier this month after a long confirmation battle. DeVos nearly lost in the Senate and it took a tie-breaking vote from Mike Pence to secure her confirmation. Of course, DeVos is only in her position today because she gave millions of dollars to sitting Republican senators.Her nomination was hotly contested because she wants to destroy the public education system in favor of religious schools. It also didn t help that she supports an organization that thinks children should be able to work in mines and thinks guns belong in schools to defend against bears.Seriously.Anyway, when DeVos attempted to visit a pubic school in Washington DC on Friday she was met by protesters who refused to let her in the door. The shamed her and ordered her to leave. She does not represent anything that they stand for!  one protester said. Keep giving money to Senate and buying your way into the position,  said another.  You should be so proud of yourself! Rather than keep trying, DeVos ran away, got in a vehicle and drove off as protesters continued yelling their disapproval.Here s the video via Twitter.WATCH: Sec. Betsy DeVos physically blocked by protesters from entering DC school turned away and left. Video: @SweeneyABC pic.twitter.com/RAycuKEVgm  ABC 7 News   WJLA (@ABC7News) February 10, 2017According to Huffington Post,Sitting Republican senators have received $115,000 from Betsy DeVos herself, and more than $950,000 from the full DeVos clan since 1980. In the past two election cycles alone, her family has donated $8.3 million to Republican Party super PACs.Furthermore, DeVos had openly admitted that she and her family have spent millions of dollars to buy influence and said she expects something in return. I have decided to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence,  she once wrote.  Now I simply concede the point. They are right. We do expect something in return. And that is why she is now Secretary of Education and why millions of parents across the country are pissed off. They should not only block her from entering schools, they should block her from entering the Education Department.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,10-Feb-17
" Trump LIVID Over Kellyanne Conway Backlash, Entire Team In CHAOS (TWEET)","Yesterday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway sparked national outcry when she used a Fox & Friends interview as a pathetic commercial for Trump s daughter Ivanka, after Nordstrom became the latest retailer to drop Ivanka s brand from its stores. It was not only an incredibly awkward interview to watch as Conway shamelessly told viewers to buy Ivanka s products, but it was also highly unethical, causing Conway to get blasted for violating ethical guidelines.Earlier today, CNN reported that Conway had to apologize to Trump for the controversy, as federal employees are not supposed to endorse products or promote the goods of friends or family (even though Trump seems to do this quite often). White House press secretary Sean Spicer was even forced to respond to the backlash, stating that Conway had been  counseled  for her behavior.Now that Conway has apologized to Trump, she s apparently back in his graces and can continue spewing her alternative facts (aka blatant lies). Conway tweeted that Trump still supports her and her shameless lack of ethics:But not all is well just yet. According to CNN, Trump is not happy with Spicer s comments about having  counseled  Conway on the matter. Apparently, Trump said he  hated  what Spicer said.This is just the latest in the breakdown of Trump s chaotic, volatile team. Every day, there is a new f**k up or controversy to react to as Trump s team proves to be the most incompetent, dishonest, disorganized and troubled team we ve ever seen operate the White House. There have already been rumors that Trump is looking to replace Spicer and Conway continues to be shunned by the media over her pathological lies, which won t work in Trump s favor. It seems like Trump s biggest supporters, Conway and Spicer, are now doing more harm than good and things are definitely imploding faster than they can handle.Featured image via Alex Wong and Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,10-Feb-17
" REPORT: Trump Hates Being President, Would Rather Play Golf At His Resort","Donald Trump reportedly no longer likes being president because he thought he would be able to act like a king.Thanks to brave staffers, we now know what life is like in the White House for Trump.Trump has had a very tough first three weeks as reality has made it clear that he can t run the government like a business. In a business, when the boss makes a policy it goes into effect and can t be held up or blocked. But Trump is finding out that his orders as president can be blocked and Trump learned that the hard way after the Ninth Circuit Court ruled against reinstating his travel ban on Thursday.A business owner can also hire their staff without any interference. But a president s staff is different. Cabinet positions must be approved by the Senate and Democrats are showing Republicans that turnabout is fair play by delaying and blocking Trump s nominees.Trump has also had to learn on the job, proving that he should have been paying more attention to briefings and studying rather than posting on Twitter. Of course, it doesn t really help that he is seeking help answering his questions from people like Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner, both of whom are just as inexperienced as Trump.According to Politico,In interviews, nearly two dozen people who ve spent time with Trump in the three weeks since his inauguration said that his mood has careened between surprise and anger as he s faced the predictable realities of governing, from congressional delays over his cabinet nominations and legal fights holding up his aggressive initiatives to staff in-fighting and leaks. Trump often asks simple questions about policies, proposals and personnel. And, when discussions get bogged down in details, the president has been known to quickly change the subject   to  seem in control at all times,  one senior government official said   or direct questions about details to his chief strategist Steve Bannon, his son-in-law Jared Kushner or House Speaker Paul Ryan. Trump has privately expressed disbelief over the ability of judges, bureaucrats or lawmakers to delay   or even stop   him from filling positions and implementing policies.Paranoia is also running rampant in the Trump White House. Trump would rather the public not know details of his phone calls to world leaders even though such information has been incredibly revealing in that it has exposed Trump s bullying of our allies and his continued sucking up to Russia.Trump has even ordered a witch hunt to find the staffers who are leaking information.Unlike President Obama, who could be leader of the free world and play golf at the same time, Trump apparently would rather leave running the country to others so he can play golf with his rich buddies at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.Seriously, Trump should resign if he can t handle being president. It has only been three weeks and he already hates his new job. And it s only going to get worse for him as he continues to do things that the American people oppose.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,10-Feb-17
 House Dem Drops SHOCKING Bombshell On National Television About Trump’s Future (VIDEO),"Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) got super candid when she made several bombshell statements about the future of Trump s time in the White House on MSNBC.In an interview, Waters flat-out said that there was a VERY good chance Trump will not last his full term (even though he for some reason thinks he s going to last 8 years like highly respected former President Barack Obama). As new polls have just been released that report half of Americans want Trump to be impeached, Waters  words are particularly timely.Waters made several legitimate, solid points when she explained why Trump wouldn t make it to the end of his term. Waters mentioned Trump s numerous conflicts of interest, his controversial relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, the disgusting anti-American statements he s made as well as the fact that the Republican Party is humiliated by him and will soon be tired of defending him. Waters explained: I don t think so because he s not going to be there for four years. He has disregarded constitutional questions. We re still digging into his conflicts of interest. His relationship to Putin and the Kremlin. I think there s a lot there. I don t intend to work with him or try to work with him, but I certainly don t intend for him to be around for four years. A lot people don t want to hear this. They re saying you re saying this, and you re talking about a president who has only been in office for a short period of time, but I do believe that he s vulnerable to impeachment. Waters also predicted that if the GOP realizes that there is a true link between Putin and Trump (and it certainly seems like there is), the Republicans will likely seek to impeach him.Waters  comments echo the predictions shared by many experts who have stated the likelihood of Trump being impeached. There is just far too much corruption surrounding him, and we re glad that Waters finally said what many members of Congress would only dare to think. You can watch her take down Trump below:Rep.

 Fox News Mocked Into Oblivion After This F*cking STUPID Attempt To Make Steve Bannon Look Sane (TWEETS),"In a desperate attempt to make Steve Bannon seem less like a crazed, apocalypse-obsessed maniac, Fox News played a little game with USA Today s deputy editorial opinion editor, David Mastio, who suggested in a recent piece that Steve Bannon and ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi shared  similar world views,  including  apocalyptic visions of a clash  between Muslims and the United States.It is true that both men share these viewpoints, but Fox took things to ridiculous levels in an effort to appear to disprove this theory. Apparently, because Bannon (unlike he and Trump s friend Putin) has not slaughtered journalists or used chemical weapons, he s a swell dude.Tucker Carlson quickly went through the chart, ticking off many of Baghdadi s more horrible actions:See? There you have it   Bannon, who until recently ran a website aimed at a white supremacist audience and who describes himself as a  Leninist  who wants to  destroy the state  is just A-OK!This cringeworthy attempt to make Bannon seem appealing by comparing him to one of the few people in the world who is worse than he is wasn t lost on the internet.

 9th Circuit BURNS Trump BAD By Sticking 5th Grade Civics Lesson In Their Decision Against Him,"Probably the biggest point of contention with Trump s Muslim ban was that it was originally written to include everyone. Refugees, people on every type of visa we issue, and even green card holders. Green card holders are people living and working in the United States legally and permanently, and yet Trump tried to tell those who were traveling that they couldn t come back to their country of legal residence.Because that caused such a massive brouhaha that compounded the rest of the chaos surrounding implementation, White House counsel Donald F. McGahn issued  authoritative guidance  saying that the relevant sections of the order didn t apply to legal permanent residents.The administration has also made claims that courts don t have access to the classified information they do, and the 9th Circuit schooled them there, too.So here s a rub. The decision states (on pages 21 and 22): At this point, however we cannot rely upon the Government s contention that the Executive Order no longer applies to lawful permanent residents. The Government has offered no authority establishing that the White House counsel is empowered to issue an amended order superseding the Executive Order signed by the President and now challenged by the States, and that proposition seems unlikely The White House counsel is not the President, and he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the Executive Departments. The court called Trump on the carpet for being unwilling to create, or formally authorize, any exemptions to his Muslim ban. They also implied that he was too idiotic to seek his own guidance, and/or understand that he signed the order, so nobody can amend it without specific authority.So McGahn can t actually amend the order and Trump can t get away with refusing to do real work.But that s not all. The court also nailed him on the uncertainty surrounding the order because everyone interprets it differently: Moreover, in light of the Government s shifting interpretations of the Executive Order, we cannot say that the current interpretation by White House counsel will persist past the immediate stage of these proceedings. On this record, therefore, we cannot conclude that the Government has shown that it is  absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur. So the court is basically saying,  We don t trust you. You ve given us zero reason to trust you. And here s another rub. Trump & Co. think they re the only people with access to the information needed to keep us safe, and they think that nobody outside their circle should get it because what if the bad people hear it? The 9th Circuit s schooling on that said (on page 28): [T]he Government asserts that,  [u]nlike the President, courts do not have access to classified information about the threat posed by terrorist organizations operating in particular nations, the efforts of those organizations to infiltrate the United States, or gaps in the vetting process.  But the Government may provide a court with classified information. Courts regularly receive classified information under seal and maintain its confidentiality. Rules and regulations have long been in place for that. Why? Because when a court is hearing a case about the legality of a certain policy decision, they need access to all information available, even if it s classified. Trump and his minions, though, likely believe that the courts are not to be trusted with classified info.

 Jason Chaffetz Runs Away Like A Coward After Americans MASSACRE Him At Town Hall (VIDEO),"Things got very uncomfortable for Jason Chaffetz as he attended a town hall in Utah Thursday night.Chaffetz, the lead Hillary Clinton Benghazi witch hunter who is currently ignoring the actions of the Trump administration   particularly with regard to The Donald s Yemen raid, which killed 30  civilians (including an American girl) and left a Navy SEAL dead   found himself met with a chorus of boos from his capacity audience at Brighton High School in a Salt Lake suburb, especially when he mentioned the name of the orange buffoon in the White House.Boy, was it a sh*tshow! The Huffington Post reports:The House Oversight Committee chairman was challenged on Donald Trump s threat to eliminate Obamacare, his vow to slash support for women s health by cutting Planned Parenthood funds, a push to sell public lands and the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. At one point, Chaffetz promised the voters that they would be  happy with the bill to abolish the Department of Education.  The crowd was not amused.Thousands of others who were not allowed in the auditorium because of police concerns about crowd control remained outside brandishing protest signs and chanting,  Chaffetz is a coward! KUTV Channel 2 reported, and  Do your job!  and  Your last term! One young girl asked Chaffetz what he was was going to do to protect the environment.  Do you believe in science? Because I do,  she said to loud cheers. I don t pretend to have all the answers,  he responded.  There are good people on both sides of the aisle,  he added to resounding boos.To add to his humiliation, a teacher stood up and humiliated Chaffetz, likening the Trump administration to her students and demanding to know where Chaffets draws his  line in the sand  with regard to the Trump family s conflicts of interest. His answer was shameful: Everyone has to comply with the law,  Chaffetz responded. You re really not going to like this part,  again to boos.  The president, under the law, is exempt from the conflict-of-interest laws.

 REPORT: NINE Officials Reveal Trump Admin LIED About Talking To Russia About Easing Sanctions,"Almost immediately following the Nov. 8 election, Trump and his fledgling administration made a point of denying that they were in contact with Russia about anything. Now his own national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is saying otherwise. Flynn has more or less said that he might have discussed the sanctions privately with Russia s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. But there are nine officials who all say he definitely did.Flynn first denied the allegations rather emphatically, according to a report from the Washington Post. However, he walked it back through his spokesman later on, who said that he  indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn t be certain that the topic never came up. That s an interesting way of not answering a question, but it might get him off the hook just a little. The Post reports that no fewer than nine officials, who have access to reports from law enforcement and intelligence agencies that monitor communications of Russian diplomats, say that Flynn s references to the sanctions Obama imposed following the election were explicit and clear. Two also said that Flynn actually told Russia not to overreact to the penalties since all of this could be discussed again after Trump was sworn in.A third official said that either Flynn had lied to Mike Pence, who flatly denied the allegations, too, or that Pence misspoke (knowing this administration, it s the former).Pence told CBS   Face the Nation  the following: I talked to General Flynn about that conversation and actually was initiated on Christmas Day he had sent a text to the Russian ambassador to express not only Christmas wishes but sympathy for the loss of life in the airplane crash that took place. It was strictly coincidental that they had a conversation. They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States  decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia. After host John Dickerson pressed him on whether Flynn had ever had a conversation about sanctions with Kislyak at any time, Pence said: Well, look. General Flynn has been in touch with diplomatic leaders, security leaders in some 30 countries. That s exactly what the incoming national security advisor should do. But what I can confirm, having spoken to him about it, is that those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the United States took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctions. He then finished that part of the interview with,  I don t believe there were more conversations. U.S. intelligence agencies became suspicious after Putin s lackluster response to our kicking out all of their diplomats, and they began to look for evidence suggesting that he was promised relief. They discovered that conversations between Flynn and Kislyak had happened around the time we announced the new sanctions and kicked their diplomats out.The administration s position was to deny, deny, deny, because of course. But Flynn isn t exactly denying it anymore. This may have something to do with Congress seeking to limit Trump s ability to ease the sanctions. It may have anything to do with anything   maybe he just feels backed into a corner now.The point is, of all the lies coming out of this administration, this is one of the biggest and the worst thus far. Oddly enough, both Flynn and his son seem to have deleted their Twitter accounts. That could be for any reason, but it s just a little too coincidental to the Post s report.Now we get to wonder what else this administration has done to aid an official enemy. Working to rebuild relationships and strengthen ties is one thing. Working to aid an enemy is another, and that s what Flynn (and by extension, Trump) has done.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",News,10-Feb-17
 BREAKING: House Democrat Moves On Impeachment For Trump (DETAILS),"While Republicans seem to be content in keeping a blind eye and sitting on their hands regarding the seemingly extremely obvious violations occurring surrounding Donald Trump, one Democrat is finally stepping up and getting to work on making sure Trump s properly investigated.According to the House website for Congressman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY): Congressman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), senior Member of the House Judiciary Committee, introduced a Resolution of Inquiry directing the Department of Justice to provide the House of Representatives with any and all information relevant to an inquiry into President Trump and his associates  conflicts of interest, ethical violations including the Emoluments Clause and Russia ties. If the House Judiciary Committee does not schedule the resolution for a Markup within 14 legislative days, it becomes a privileged resolution and can be brought to the floor in front of the full House for a vote. According to Nadler: Democrats have repeatedly asked the Majority, in letters to Chairman Goodlatte and Speaker Ryan, to investigate these ongoing conflicts of interest, and those requests have been ignored. Adding: Donald Trump has refused to step away from his business interests in any meaningful way, his foreign entanglements are likely unconstitutional, he has repeatedly refused to disclose his financial assets, and he is clouded by the specter of Russian intervention in the election and his Administration. Republicans have shown zero willingness to follow through on their duty to conduct oversight, and they must be held accountable if they are truly willing to abdicate this constitutional obligation and must be made to answer to the American people for that failure. We must know what the Department has learned about the Administration s connections to the Russian government. We must review the Department s legal analysis if there is any of the President s feeble attempt to remedy his wide-ranging ethics problems. We must conduct oversight of the least transparent Administration in modern history. This resolution represents a start. This resolution is definitely a step towards impeachment in the eyes of many. If Trump were to be found in violation of any of the things in question, it can and should be subject to further scrutiny and investigation, subsequently leading towards an impeachable offense(s).This is definitely a step in the proper direction. Kudos to Rep. Nadler for getting the ball rolling.Read more:Featured Photo by Chris Kleponis-Pool/Getty Images",News,10-Feb-17
 Obama’s Attorney General Just Spit In Trump’s Face Over 9th Circuit Court Ruling,"With the 9th Circuit Court ruling against the Trump administration and in favor of Washington State, Minnesota, and by proxy everyone else that was harmed by his Muslim ban, we have the inevitable rage-fest from Trump, along with people who are spitting in his face and stomping on his pride because they agree with the courts.One of the people who probably agrees with how the courts have been ruling is Sally Yates, the acting attorney general that Trump fired because she refused to enforce the ban. Trump didn t just quietly let her go, though. He accused her of betraying her department, and implied that she d betrayed the U.S.Now, enter Eric Holder. He was Obama s attorney general before Loretta Lynch, and spearheaded Department of Justice investigations into controversial things, such as whether the police department in Ferguson, Missouri was guilty of racial profiling, among other things. Holder, of course, also seems to believe that Trump s Muslim ban was a bad idea.So he, too, is rubbing the 9th Circuit s decision in Trump s face because, surprise surprise, Yates was vindicated in her decision to refuse to enforce the Muslim ban. Here s what Holder posted to Twitter:Skill, judgment, courgage. VINDICATED. 3-0 pic.twitter.com/5A2uPTXRps  Eric Holder (@EricHolder) February 10, 2017Yup.Trump has called the decision political, because of course he thinks that way.

The best thing that could happen would be for the Supreme Court to decline to even hear the case.In the meantime, Sally Yates is vindicated, and Trump can go suck it.Read more:Featured image by Aaron P.

 ALERT: Republicans Push Bill To Split Ninth Circuit Court In Response To Ruling Against Trump,"Republicans are now gunning for the Ninth Circuit Court in an effort to kill courts that don t have a strictly conservative viewpoint.Not long after the Ninth Circuit Court ruled against reinstating Donald Trump s executive order banning travel into the United States from seven countries, Republicans made a bill written by GOP Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain a top priority.Conservatives have long despised the Ninth Circuit, which is based in San Francisco, for issuing rulings they don t like.If the bill were to pass, the Ninth Circuit Court would be split in two and a 12th Circuit Court would be created. The Ninth would continue to have jurisdiction over California, Oregon, Hawaii, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands while the 12th would have jurisdiction over Republican-controlled states like Arizona, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska with Washington and Nevada thrown in.Basically, Republicans are trying to rig the judicial branch in their favor.Flake and McCain are whining that the Ninth is too liberal and that it has jurisdiction over too much of the country.  It represents 20 percent of the population   and 40 percent of the land mass is in that jurisdiction. It s just too big,  Flake told Fox News on Wednesday.  We have a bedrock principle of swift justice and if you live in Arizona or anywhere in the 9th Circuit, you just don t have it. Fox News also used the fact that the Ninth Circuit Court holds the record for most decisions overturned by the Supreme Court as an excuse to justify the split.However, it should also be pointed out that the Ninth also holds the record for the most decisions upheld.Of course, considering that conservatives have held a majority on the Supreme Court for decades, it s pretty obvious why many decisions of the Ninth have been reversed.Conservatives have been trying to split up the Ninth Circuit for many years. Flake claims that liberal judges on the court are at fault but a commission formed by Congress in 1998 recommended against splitting it up. Both chambers had Republican majorities at the time.It s not unprecedented for Congress to split a court, but this time it s different. Republicans are only targeting the Ninth because they hate the rulings that come out of it. So now they aim to kill rulings they don t like by preventing them altogether.This is a Republican ploy to seize power in the judicial branch to prevent rulings against their agenda like the one handed down against Trump on Thursday.It s eerily similar to the  court packing  scheme conservatives opposed when Franklin Roosevelt tried to add more judges to the Supreme Court. Now conservatives apparently have no problem with such schemes as long as they favor their side.This is something the American people must oppose. Rigging the court system is totally un-American and undemocratic, especially since it is very clear that Republicans are doing this for partisan reasons.Donald Trump is not a king. And the judicial branch serves as a crucial check on executive power to keep the government balanced. But if Republicans have their way, there will be one less check and the balance will tip overwhelmingly their way.Read more:Featured image via Wikimedia",News,9-Feb-17
 Hillary Clinton Just Dropped The MIC On Trump After His Muslim Ban Got Shut Down AGAIN (TWEETS),"On Thursday, Donald Trump was devastated after an appeals court completely rejected Donald Trump s Muslim ban. The Trump administration has lost dramatically and completely and they re going to have to decide what to do next,  CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said following the court s 3-0 complete repudiation of the Trump ban. The Government has taken the position that the President s decisions about immigration policy, particularly when motivated by national security concerns, are unreviewable, even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections,  the court said, adding that the Muslim ban  runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy. The judges, who were appointed by three different Presidents, flat-out rejected the Trump administration s claim that his decisions are absolute and unquestionable: The Supreme Court has made clear that the Government s authority and expertise in [such] matters do not automatically trump the Court s own obligation to secure the protection that the Constitution grants to individuals, even in times of war. There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy. After getting  checked,  Trump tweeted out an  unbalanced  all-caps tantrum, vowing that he will  SEE YOU IN COURT  even though he had just been there, where he lost embarrassingly.SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!

 Government Ethics Office Systems Crash After Avalanche Of Complaints About Kellyanne Conway (TWEETS),"Kellyanne Conway s decision to provide Ivanka Trump s crappy products with a  free commercial  during an appearance on Fox News has already claimed its first casualty: pretty much every major system at the Office of Government Ethics.The Hill reports that the office s website was down for several hours Thursday following Conway s interesting and unethical mix of her boss s daughter s business interests and her own official capacity as propaganda minister. It s a wonderful line. I own some of it,  Conway said of Ivanka s various overpriced products during an appearance on Fox News Thursday.  I fully   I m going to give a free commercial here.

She is a great person   always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 This is a direct attack on his policies and her name,  White House press secretary Sean Spicer said of the company s decision to drop a product line they deemed unworthy to be on the shelves.While Ivanka feigns surprise, Nordstrom says they informed her last month her products would be dropped. We made this decision based on performance,  a Nordstrom spokesperson told NBC News.  Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now. We ve had a great relationship with the Ivanka Trump team,  the spokesperson added.  We ve had open conversations with them over the past year to share what we ve seen and Ivanka was personally informed of our decision in early January. Nordstrom isn t the only retailer to drop Ivanka Trump. Neiman Marcus has stopped selling her jewelry on their website and TJ Maxx instructed employees to throw Ivanka s signage in the trash where they belong and hide whatever product they have in the normal sales racks.Read more:Featured image via Getty Images (Mark Wilson)/screengrab",News,9-Feb-17
 Trump Throws All-Caps Tantrum After Appeals Court’s Unanimous Decision To SHUT DOWN Muslim Ban (TWEETS),"If there s one takeaway from Thursday, it s that Donald Trump is probably going to lay in bed in that bathrobe he doesn t own and cry himself to sleep for days. In yet another blow to Trump s ego and victory for the Constitution, a federal appeals court became the third in the nation to tell The Donald to take his Muslim ban and shove it up his big orange ass.Trump s DOJ lawyers tried everything from claiming that the ban, which blocked people from seven predominantly Muslim countries that have not been tied to a deadly terrorist attack within our borders since 9/11 from entering the United States, is necessary to protect our nation, to actually attempting to get the court to agree that President Asterisk s decisions are absolute and unreviewable by any court. The Supreme Court has made clear that the Government s authority and expertise in [such] matters do not automatically trump the Court s own obligation to secure the protection that the Constitution grants to individuals, even in times of war,  the court said. There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.

 Unhinged Sean Spicer Lashes Out At ‘Silly’ Reporters During INSANE Press Briefing (VIDEO),"White House press secretary Sean Spicer held a press briefing today and inadvertently just handed Saturday Night Live new material. Spicer repeatedly interrupted and talked over reporters while trying to defend alleged president Donald Trump. He also had to address top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway s blunder this morning on Fox & Friends in which she literally hawked Ivanka s clothing line.A reporter asked about Trump s attacks on a federal judge this week. Part of the reason the President got elected is because he speaks his mind   he s not going to hold back when he feels passionate,  Spicer said.Other reporters asked about that, too, then the exchange became more tense. Thank you, you ve now asked the question about eight times,  Spicer said. Something she said to CNN earlier this week is that the President doesn t comment on everything,  a reporter said.  I want to contrast the President s repeated statements about Nordstrom with the lack of comments about some other things, including, for example, the attack on Quebec s mosque and other similar environments. Why is the President, when he chooses to I literally stand at this podium and opened a briefing a couple days ago about the President expressing his condolences,  Spicer interrupted.  I literally opened the briefing about it. So for you to sit there and say I was here!  the reporter said. I know, so why are you asking why he didn t do it when I literally stood here and did it?  Spicer asked. I m talking about the President s statement  the reporter said. I don t understand what you re asking,  Spicer replied. Kellyanne s comments were about how the President doesn t have time to tweet about everything,  the reporter said.  He s tweeting about this. He s not tweeting about something else. I came out here and actually spoke about it and said the President  Spicer said. We re talking about the President s time,  the reporter said. What are you you re equating me addressing the nation here and a tweet? I don t, I mean that s the silliest thing I ve ever heard. OK. This is silly,  Spicer said while speaking over the reporter.  Next. OK. Thank you. You ve asked your question. Thank you. Conway s bigly mistake this morning was brought up. Questions have been raised after Kellyanne Conway did an interview, I believe it was with Fox News this morning, where she appeared to, from the confines of the Brady briefing room, promote the products of Ivanka Trump,  a reporter said.  Do you believe that she crossed an ethical line here? Kellyanne has been counseled and that s all we re going to go with,  Spicer replied.  She s been counseled on that subject, and that s it. Not so fast, Spanky. She violated Federal Code  2635.702.Watch: Melissa McCarthy is sitting somewhere with a big smile on her face.Read more:Image via screen capture",News,9-Feb-17
 Donald Trump Has Become So Toxic That He Can’t Even Find People To Work For Him (DETAILS),"Since the coronation inauguration of Donald Trump, his administration has been so scandal ridden and so petulant that he s scaring even Washington s most power hungry from climbing the political ladder. He s desperately trying to find a Joseph Goebbels communications director and he s having no luck whatsoever finding someone to peddle his lies.Trump s Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus is temporarily filling the position of communications director, and frankly, with Steve Bannon doing the job of shadow government chief of staff, he probably has the time, but still, Trump, like the people who held that office before him, needs to find his person and so far, at least two have turned him down flat. There is a list of candidates, but I can see why people aren t interested. It s a tough job,  said a senior administration official.Those difficulties are compounded by Trump s management style: The president is known to pit his senior aides against each other, creating rivalries and divisions among his staff that have already impacted the rollout of a major policy initiative. Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, the president s chief strategist and senior adviser, managed to keep the president s executive order on immigration so closely held that it not only erroneously banned green-card holders from entering the country, but also left members of the Cabinet   responsible for defending the policy   scrambling to respond.Source: PoliticoNot to mention the fact that most of the communications to come out of the current White House are either completely unethical or completely untrue. That s not exactly something that most people feel comfortable adding to their CV.For Democrats and for sane Americans, this is a small sign but it s a significant one. Trump loves to compare the country to a business and well, if we re going with that comparison, Trump is the Ford Pinto of politics. If a person gets too close, their career goes up in flames. As people in Washington are distancing themselves from the toxic orange man, you ll begin to see Republicans in Congress do the same. It s already happening with Trump s Supreme Court nominee.Read more:Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,9-Feb-17
" Trump Just Met With Airline Execs, RUINS Meeting With INSANELY Unpresidential Rant (VIDEO)","Donald Trump has turned yet another meeting in which he should have been focusing on being America s president and getting sh*t done into an absolute circus and embarrassment.During a meeting with airline executives, Trump decided that he was bored and could no longer focus, so he went on a completely incoherent rant about things his personal pilot had told him. As you can imagine, everyone in the room was shocked as Trump continued to hijack the meeting and went on babbling, making it impossible to actually get anything accomplished until he was finished.According to the White House pool report, Trump commended airlines for succeeding  despite the bad equipment that the airport gives you, in many cases.  Then he started complaining about the equipment, stating that he had  a pilot who s a real expert  who once told him that airlines are often given  the wrong stuff.  Trump continued: Let s order the right equipment. Probably the wrong equipment cost more. Here are some more gems from his rant: We want the traveling public to have the greatest customer service and with an absolute minimum of delays. We spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East, we got nothing. And we have an obsolete plane system, we have obsolete airports. As you can imagine, most of this rant made zero sense. This has become a pattern for Trump   he continues to meet with industry CEOs, but he doesn t actually accomplish anything. He doesn t tackle policy, and he spends most of his time talking about himself or complaining. This shouldn t be too surprising, considering that we elected a former reality television star who knows NOTHING about policy, so he s obviously doing whatever he can to pass the time in these meetings.You can watch Trump go completely off track in the meeting below:Read more:Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,9-Feb-17
 Federal Judge Questions Trump’s Legitimacy After Attack On Fellow Judge For Halting Muslim Ban,"The judicial branch of our government is getting sick and tired of Donald Trump s tirades.After Trump signed an unconstitutional executive order banning travelers from seven countries from entering the United States, worldwide chaos ensued.Thousands of people were detained and denied their rights as attorneys raced to their rescue. A federal judge then blocked the order and Trump has been attacking U.S. District Court Judge James Robart ever since.The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017Trump has literally been whining about Judge Robarts  decision for over a week and acts like judges aren t allowed to act as a check and balance against the executive branch.And his behavior toward Robarts has angered one federal judge so much that he is calling Trump s legitimacy into a question, which is a yuuuge deal.Federal District Judge Dan Polster explained to the Cleveland Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday and explained that checks and balances exist because the Founding Fathers  were fearful of a president who might want to be a king or dictator,  which is exactly how Trump is acting.Polster continued by telling the audience that he doesn t think any federal judge will be intimidated by Trump because they  took an oath to support and defend the Constitution and it means a lot and I think that oath means even more today. With that said, Polster believes Trump undermined his legitimacy by attacking the judicial branch for halting the executive order. This is serious business, because you start calling into question the legitimacy of someone, that undermines the whole system, all right? I think to say it publicly, that s his right. But it calls into question, and some might even say forfeits, his or her own legitimacy. So I ll leave it at that. It s an important question, but that s how I feel. When you call into question the legitimacy of a federal district court judge, that s a line that shouldn t be crossed. And there you have it. Trump s attacks on our judicial branch are literally starting to backfire on him as judges start to speak out publicly against him. While Trump has the right to disagree with judges, personally attacking them disgraces the office he holds and diminishes the power of the executive branch. It makes Trump s position look weak and desperate. And it could affect the decisions judges make in the future on executive orders and laws Trump signs. In short, trying to bully judges is not a good idea.Read more:Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,9-Feb-17
 WATCH: Ethics Expert BUSTS Kellyanne Conway For Breaking Rules By Shilling For Ivanka Trump’s Business,"Kellyanne Conway advertised Ivanka Trump s clothing and product line during a Fox News interview on Thursday morning. And that is expressly forbidden by federal regulations.On Wednesday, Donald Trump lashed out at the retailer Nordstrom for dropping his daughter s product line after months of boycotts and lack of sales made it unfeasible to continue carrying them.My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person   always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017On Fox & Friends, Conway literally begged Fox viewers to buy Ivanka s products. Go buy Ivanka s stuff is what I would tell you,  she said after accusing Nordstrom of attacking Donald Trump by targeting his daughter.  I hate shopping, I m going to go get some myself today. This is just a wonderful line. I own some of it. I fully   I m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online. And with those words, Conway broke Federal Code  2635.702, which bans public employees from using their office for private or personal gain, including for family members. Donald Trump did this through Conway and she works for him, making her a public employee.Federal Code  2635.702 specifically states,An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity, including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member.It further states that,  An employee shall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office to endorse any product, service or enterprise. There are only two exceptions to this rule and neither excuse what Conway did.And that why former ethics czar Norm Eisen called out Conway during an appearance on MSNBC and called for an investigation and penalties. By doing this ad   I have never seen anything like it   it s a violation of the rules, pure and simple. I imagine that you are going to see complaints flowing in. The responsibility to oversee this in the first instance is with the White House counsel, Don McGahn. He s going to need to look at the rules, look at the precedents and decide what range of penalties might apply. And I think the Office of Government Ethics will also have a look at it. So, it s a serious matter. Here s the video via YouTube:Kellyanne Conway and Donald Trump violated federal regulations and ethics rules. He literally used his office to advertise his daughter s shitty products by sending Kellyanne Conway on Fox News and there needs to be consequences for what they did.Read more:Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,9-Feb-17
 WATCH: Bill Maher Brutally Explains To A Trump Fan Why He Won’t Give Trump A Chance,"Don t ask Bill Maher to give Donald Trump a chance. Because he ll tell you the truth about why he won t.During a CNN town hall event that will air on Thursday, the Real Time host bombarded a Trump supporter with reality after being asked to give Trump a chance. The president has been in office barely three weeks,  the man began.  Why can t you guys in the media and Hollywood give him some slack? Because of what he s done!  Maher quickly replied. But it s only been three weeks!  the man said.In those three weeks, however, Trump has done more to damage and embarrass our country than any president in modern times and Bill Maher proceeded to tell the delusional Trump supporter all about it. It s a giant con, what he s done. He ran for the  little man.  And then what does he do? He gets into office, the coal companies can dump sludge in the river. Because, you know, that s what the  little man  is aching for. Undoing Dodd-Frank, because so many of the town halls in Appalachia, people were standing up and saying,  Mr. Trump, please get rid of the Volcker Rule, because if I can t make certain speculative investments, it s killing us here! Indeed, Trump promised his rich friends that he would dismantle Dodd-Frank, the law that regulates Wall Street to prevent banks from doing the same things that caused the Great Recession in 2008.Trump has also been attacking the Environmental Protection Agency by making their job harder. Trump is chipping away at Clean Water and Clean Air rules that keeps Americans safe and healthy.Trump has also already botched a military raid and is escalating confrontations with China and Iran. And he is doing all this while insulting our allies.And that s just the tip of an iceberg that includes taking healthcare away from millions of Americans and attacking Social Security and Medicare.It may have only been three weeks, but Trump has done a lot in those three weeks to deserve all the criticism he has received.But Maher also pointed out that Trump is unfit to be president on a personal level because of his thin skin and tendency to lie every time he opens his mouth or posts on Twitter. It s beyond politics, it s about sanity,  Maher continued.  It s about somebody who makes stuff up, who doesn t read. His information is either anecdotal, or pulled out of his  behind. Here s the video via YouTube.Any Trump supporter who seriously thinks Trump should be given a chance is only expecting blind support for a man who is clearly unqualified for the office he holds.Nothing Trump has said or done so far is worthy of respect. He whines about the media every day and hurls personal attacks and insults at anyone who criticizes or opposes him. Giving him a chance equates to supporting him no matter what he says or does. He is petty and only cares about himself. And every Trump supporter who says otherwise is lying to themselves as much as Trump lies to the public.Read more:Featured image via screenshot",News,9-Feb-17
" Republicans Silenced Elizabeth Warren For Opposing Jeff Sessions, But Her Response Will TERRIFY Them (TWEETS)","Last night, the Republican Party did something truly disgusting   they not only silenced Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren for opposing Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, but they went ahead and confirmed him as Attorney General.When she was voicing her opposition to Sessions, Warren began to read the words of Coretta Scott King aloud, which had expressed resistance to Sessions in 1986. The GOP shut her down, prompting several hashtags such as #LetLizSpeak and #NeverthelessShePersisted to trend on Twitter, as well as national outcry.Later that night, Warren issued her own message to the Republican Party, and she officially put them on notice. Warning the GOP that they had just put a man with radical hatred  in charge of the DOJ, Warren said:Then, she gave them a fair warning that this was far from the last time she would speak out about Sessions:And that wasn t all. Last night, Warren made a surprising appearance on  The Daily Show,  where she spoke about being silenced and the new unethical Attorney General. She said: Look, the main thing is that millions of people are now reading Coretta Scott King s letter. It is an amazing letter. It is a letter full of passion. It is a letter full of heart, and it is a letter full of advice to us. It talks about a moment in history when African-Americans were beaten away from the polls, and it talks about Jeff Sessions s role in that, and I think it has an important lesson today for all of America. Thanks to Warren s passion and courage, many Americans throughout the country now know the truth about Jeff Sessions, and will be watching his actions closely. Yesterday, the GOP showed Americans that the Republican Party truly does not care about racial justice and wants do everything it can to help Trump Make America White Again. We know that Warren and the Democrats behind her won t let them get away with it, and her warning to the GOP gives us hope.Read more:Featured image via Ethan Miller / Getty Images",News,9-Feb-17
 WATCH: Trump Get His A** Handed To Him By Chris Cuomo For Crying ‘Fake News’ During Broadcast,"Donald Trump got humiliated in real time on Thursday morning as CNN host Chris Cuomo responded to a tweet on the air.During an interview with Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, Cuomo discussed Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. Blumenthal had earlier confirmed that Gorsuch criticized Trump s disgraceful attack on the federal judge who halted his executive order banning travel from seven countries into the United States. He said very specifically that they were demoralizing and disheartening and he characterized them very specifically that way,  Blumenthal said after meeting with Gorsuch.  I said they were more than disheartening and I said to him that he has an obligation to make his views clear to the American people, so they understand how abhorrent or unacceptable President Trump s attacks on the judiciary are. Gorsuch confirmed his remarks via a spokesman, but that didn t stop Trump from lashing out at Cuomo and Blumenthal on Twitter.Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave  service  in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017In reality, Cuomo did ask Blumenthal about his misrepresentation of his military service, which basically stems from Blumenthal having misspoken that he served in Vietnam when he meant that he served during Vietnam but not actually in the war. He has apologized for the mistake multiple times. Meanwhile, Donald Trump never served at all because he dodged the draft.Anyway, Cuomo learned of Trump s attack on the air and he responded in real time.Cuomo asked that the beginning of his interview with Blumenthal be aired again. What is your response to the president of the United States who says you should not be believed because you misrepresented your military record in the past?  Cuomo asked.Clearly, Cuomo did ask Blumenthal about his military service. The president, with all due respect, is off on the facts,  Cuomo said.  He just keeps doubling down when the facts don t favor his position. Indeed, even CNN issued a brief statement, which includes video, via Twitter.@realDonaldTrump . @ChrisCuomo did address that point at the start of his interview. https://t.co/JWJEAshv1y Those are the facts.  CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 9, 2017At this point, Donald Trump really should be embarrassed and he owes CNN and Chris Cuomo a public apology.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,9-Feb-17
 WATCH: Kellyanne Conway Pathetically Begs People To Buy Ivanka Trump’s Products On Fox News,"Donald Trump is clearly using the office of the presidency to enrich himself and his family, a clear violation of the Constitution.In January, the retailer Nordstrom informed Ivanka Trump of their decision to drop her product line from their stores. A boycott of Ivanka s products and any retailer who sells them contributed to the decision. That s the way the free market works.But after the decision became public earlier this week Trump lost his shit over it on Wednesday.My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person   always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017Nordstrom responded by announcing that the decision was made purely for business reasons and that Ivanka was informed last month and understood the choice they made. Since then, Nordstrom s stock has risen and other retailers have also dropped Ivanka s products.And so, Donald Trump sent Kellyanne Conway on Fox News on Thursday to give free advertising to Ivanka s business. They are using the most prominent woman in Donald Trump s life,  Conway began.  Using her, who has been a champion for empowerment of women in the workplace, to get to him. I think she s gone from 800 stores to a thousand stores, or a thousand places where you can buy. You can buy her goods online,  she continued before literally telling Fox viewers to go buy her products. Go buy Ivanka s stuff is what I would tell you. I hate shopping, I m going to go get some myself today. This is just wonderful line. I own some of it. I fully   I m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online. Here s the video via YouTube.Seriously. Kellyanne Conway actually shilled for Ivanka s products during an interview. This is not only an unconstitutional conflict of interest, it s completely unfair. Trump is literally using his platform to advertise his daughter s business, a business she was supposedly going to walk away from because she joined Trump s White House team. Clearly, she lied just like her daddy did.The fact that Conway appeared on Fox to advertise for the Trumps demonstrates that Donald Trump only sees the presidency as a way to enrich himself and his family. He doesn t give a damn about the economy or foreign policy or any other problems we face. He only cares about personal profit and this is proof of his selfishness.Featured Image: Yana Paskova/Getty Images",News,9-Feb-17
 The Full Details Of Trump’s FAILED Yemen Raid Will Make You Sick To Your Stomach,"When Donald Trump was campaigning he said something chilling, something that was widely dismissed as  all bluster : that to deal with terrorism, you have to slaughter their families. The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don t kid yourself. When they say they don t care about their lives, you have to take out their families,  Trump told Fox and Friends as he promised he would not fight a  very politically correct war. In his very first raid as President, he showed the world that he meant it. The operation was approved over dinner without adequate planning or intelligence (in any sense), and it was a disaster from the very beginning.According to reports from locals, the first person hit was 11-year-old Ahmed Abdelilah Ahmed al Dahab, who heard commotion outside and went to check what was happening. When my son Ahmed saw them, he couldn t tell that they were soldiers because it was dark,  the boy s father says.  He asked them  Who are you?  but the men shot him. He was the first killed. No one thought that marines would descend on our homes to kill us, kill our children and kill our women.  Another member of his family, 12-year-old Nasser, was killed.One woman, Fatim Saleh al Ameri, was shot while trying to flee with her two-year-old son.  We pulled him out from his mother s lap. He was covered in her blood,  said 11-year-old Basil Ahmed Abad al  Zouba, whose 17-year-old brother was killed in Trump s Folly.Abdallah al Ameri, who had years earlier survived a U.S. attack on his wedding party of which he was not the target, was killed along with his 25-year-old daughter Fatima and 38-year-old son Mohammed. Three of Mohammed s children   4-year-old Aisha, 7-year-old Khadija, and 5-year-old Hussein. Another nine members of his family were killed in the raid, including 5-year-old Halima and 6-year-old Mursil. I was woken up after midnight by the bombing of the helicopters. There were soldiers on the ground shooting at us. They started shooting at us with machine gun fire,  witness Fahad Ali al Ameri says of the attack. His three-month-old daughter Asma Fahad Ali al Ameri was killed in her crib, asleep.Also killed was the eight-year-old daughter of an al Qaeda propagandist, American citizen Nawar Anwar Al-Awlaqi, who was hiding in a building at the time.  Some of the gunfire went through the windows and Nawar was injured in her neck,  her uncle, whom she was visiting, says. .  We tried to save her but we couldn t do anything for her. It is true they were targeting al Qaeda but why did they have to kill children and women and elderly people?  said Zabnallah Saif al Ameri, If such slaughter happened in their country, there would be a lot of shouting about human rights. When our children are killed, they are quiet. Trump s raid failed to kill the primary target, Qassim al-Rimi, who is currently taunting  Easy D  in propaganda videos, but did manage to snag three super-important videos that are about a decade old and available on YouTube. The tradeoff for this disaster was about 14 dead militants and 30 noncombatants as well as a member of SEAL Team 6.Because of this disaster, Yemen has withdrawn permission for the United States to conduct anti-terror operations in the country, thus damaging our ability to combat extremism.Naturally, Trump called this massive boner a  success.

 Twitter TRASHES Draft Dodger Donald Trump After Disgusting Attack On John McCain (TWEETS),"On Wednesday, Senator John McCain responded to White House Press Secretary s claim that the massively failed raid in Yemen that left 30 civilians and a Navy SEAL dead, didn t achieve its primary objective, and managed to recover copies of three videos that have been on YouTube for about a decade, a  huge success. According to Spicer, any criticism of the raid   which Trump authorized over dinner without adequate planning, preparation, or backup after his staffers goaded him with claims that Obama would not have the cajones to do it   is a  disservice  to the dead. The life of chief Ryan Owens was done in service to his country and we owe him and his family a great debt for the information we received during that raid,  Spicer said.  Any suggestion otherwise is a disservice to his courageous life and the actions he took. Full stop.  McCain disagrees: Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy!  Trump tweeted. He s been losing so long he doesn t know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in   bogged down in conflict all over the place. Sen.

While he did manage to mow down women and children wholesale, Trump s raid missed al Qaeda leader Qassim al-Rimi, the primary target. Since the raid, al-Rimi has been taunting and mocking Trump in his propaganda videos. Our hero Ryan died on a winning mission ( according to General Mattis), not a  failure.'  Trump concluded triumphantly.  Time for the U.S. to get smart and start winning again! It is probably past time for us to  get smart  and  start winning again,  but it seems that we will need to wait four years for that. The raid killed about double the number of civilians as it did militants, the important, game-changing intelligence recovered turned out to be decade-old YouTube videos, he missed his primary target, and Yemen revoked our permission to conduct anti-terrorism operations within their borders.If this is  winning  in Trump s America, it is time for all of us to be frightened. Fortunately, The Internet is here to let Trump know what they think of his new, GREAT America where losing is winning and the Ku Klux Klan is not an extremist group.This won t be the last time Trump gets people killed with his impulsive ego-driven mistakes. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/fmu26DyHHI  Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) February 9, 2017.@realDonaldTrump ryan died because you screwed up. his blood and the blood of the american girl who died is on your hands. you did that.

 WATCH: Colbert Asks Tapper How CNN Staff Feels About Their Feud With Trump; His Response Is PERFECT,"Donald Trump is no fan of CNN. He has repeatedly tried to discredit and delegitimize the network, even going so far as to call them fake news and refuse to answer a question from one of their reporters during the only press conference he has held since Inauguration Day.Well, one of CNN s best anchors, Jake Tapper, who hosts The Lead and State of the Union, stopped by the Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Wednesday night, and of course the topic of Trump came up. More specifically, the topic of CNN s relationship with Trump came up. After the niceties were exchanged Colbert started out by reading a list of insulting adjectives that Trump had used to describe the network, then went on to ask Tapper: Why are you so mean to him, Jake? If you guys just didn t fact-check him anymore, he wouldn t be saying these things about you. Tapper responded: That s a good point. Then, Colbert went on to say: What s it like in the halls over there knowing that the president actively doesn t like your network? Tapper then delivered the best   and presumably honest   zinger that would really hit home for Trump: I don t think anybody cares. Now, this is important because Trump NEEDS people to care about him, how he feels, what he says, what he thinks. As Tapper points out, it is not a reporter s job to be liked. It is a reporter s job to hold people accountable. Now that we have a president and a White House that actively lies on a routine basis to the American public, it s vital to the survival of our democracy that Tapper and those like him continue to fact-check Trump, no matter how many insane insults he throws at them.The relevant part comes a couple of minutes into the following video, but the entire interview is beyond awesome:Featured image via video screen capture",News,9-Feb-17
 Democratic Senator Voted To Confirm Career Racist Sessions And What Happened Next Is PERFECT (SCREENSHOTS/TWEETS),"Apparently, West Virginia Democrat   not to be confused with real Democrats   Joe Manchin effectively told voter he doesn t want his job anymore when he was the only person supposedly on  our side  who voted to confirm lifetime racist and embarrassment to humanity Jeff Sessions as Attorney General.Manchin, who reportedly considered switching to Republican just after the 2016 election (though he denies it), has been on the wrong side of history many times in his career. Not only did he vote with Republicans to terminate funding for Planned Parenthood after right-wing  activists  produced heavily-edited propaganda videos that claimed the women s health organization sells  baby parts,  but he is so deep in the pockets of the coal industry that the lint is jealous. On top of that, Manchin has been endorsed by the NRA and has supported legislation that sought to prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas. While Manchin has been criticized for all of that in the past, his decision to support a career racist for Attorney General is bringing a sh*tstorm his way that he seems to have failed to anticipate.Shortly after the vote, Manchin s Wikipedia page underwent some renovations   most notably the word  traitor  above his head and a note that he voted with republicans  on the horrible Jeff Sessions :Manchin s decision to betray his party, his country and everything decent in the world is not going over well on social media, where pretty much everyone seems to want to set him adrift:@LoganPhares @JalyIV Stop calling yourself a Democrat, your not.

 PA Senator Issues An EPIC Challenge To Trump After He Offers To ‘Destroy’ Someone For A Friend (TWEETS),"Recently, Donald Trump shocked even his critics by openly offering to  destroy  a Texas state senator for a Sheriff who didn t like his opposition to the corrupt practice of civil asset forfeiture   that s when police can take your stuff regardless of whether or not you have been convicted of a crime and you often have to prove your possessions  innocent  to get them back.After Rockwall County, Texas, Sheriff Harold Eavenson, told Trump about a lawmaker who had proposed asset forfeiture legislation he thinks would aid drug cartels, Trump straight-up offered to destroy the guy: Who is the state senator? Do you want to give his name? We ll destroy his career. The room erupted in nervous laughter, but Eavenson refused to name names. I m not into assassinating his character,  he said.Sheriff tells Trump that state senator is doing something he doesn't likeTrump: ""Do you want to give his name? We'll destroy his career."" pic.twitter.com/75y3t9zc54  Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 7, 2017Currently, the only lawmaker in Texas to propose eliminating the corrupt practice is Senator Konni Burton   a woman and a conservative   though others, Republicans Don Huffines and Bob Hall, are on record as opposing asset forfeiture. Ultimately, it appears that Trump s sheriff was lying to him.Whether or not Trump s buddy was lying, one state senator from Pennsylvania who also opposes the practice has something to say to Trump: Bring it. Hey @realDonaldTrump I oppose civil asset forfeiture too!  Democratic Senator Daylin Leach wrote on Tuesday.  Why don t you try to destroy my career you fascist, loofa-faced, shit-gibbon!

Laurel McNair (@yamdothprotest) February 9, 2017Konni Burton also spoke out against Trump and his sheriff friend., pointing out that she didn t even know who the hell the latter was until he opened his mouth and appeared to issue a veiled attack against her. I have never met with Sheriff Eavenson, nor even heard of him before yesterday. However, I take exception to his comments on asset forfeiture reform,  she said in a statement, adding that she will not be  discouraged nor deterred  by the attack.No matter who Trump offered to destroy, even if  he  was a figment of Eavenson s imagination, it is clear that we have an unstable, vindictive, tangerine menace in the White House   one that needs to be removed by any legal means available as soon as possible.Featured image via screengrab",News,9-Feb-17
 Sarah Palin Could Be Trump’s Ambassador To Canada And Canadians Are NOT Liking It (TWEETS),"Canadians are not pleased after White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer refused to rule out Sarah Palin as Donald Trump s choice as Ambassador to Canada.During yet another disastrous press briefing, Spicer suggested to reporters that Trump is considering America s village idiot as the United States Ambassador to Canada. We have no additional ambassador nominations or announcements to make on that front,  Spicer said when asked about Palin s name being floated for the position.  I m sure at some point we will have soon. He didn t say that Palin would be chosen, but he didn t deny that she was being considered either. The thought that Sarah Palin could end up being sent to Canada horrified many Canadians, who proceeded to mock Trump and Palin.Sarah Palin as ambassador?

And she already is by merely being mentioned for the job.If Trump is going to send Palin to another country he should send her to one far, far away so we don t have to hear from her for a long time.

 Trump’s Own SCOTUS Nominee Just Threw Him Under The Bus Over His Stupid Tweets,"Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump s nominee for the Supreme Court seat that s sat empty since Antonin Scalia died a year ago, has joined the ranks of the outraged when it comes to Trump and his damned Twitter account. Gorsuch is specifically upset with Trump s statements about the judiciary branch of the government, and told Sen. Richard Blumenthal that in a meeting earlier today: He said very specifically that they were demoralizing and disheartening and he characterized them very specifically that way,  Blumenthal said of Gorsuch.  I said they were more than disheartening and I said to him that he has an obligation to make his views clear to the American people, so they understand how abhorrent or unacceptable President Trump s attacks on the judiciary are. For someone who sits on the bench, it s easy to see how that would be disheartening and demoralizing. An attack doesn t have to be directed squarely at you to still feel like an attack. Trump attacked our entire judicial system and insulted all the judges within it when he went off on Judge Robart for blocking his Muslim ban. Gorsuch told Sen. Chuck Schumer as much, too.The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has been hearing arguments on the legality of the Muslim ban, and apparently the three judges hearing that case gave the lawyers arguing a really tough time. They grilled the lawyer representing the Department of Justice on whether the government even had evidence that the seven countries named in the ban are connected to terrorism.It s a pointed question because Saudi Arabia, which does have strong ties to terrorism and has exported terrorism to the U.S., is not included in the ban. When August Flentje refused to answer it and instead tried again to argue that Trump has broad authority in this area, Judge Michelle Friedland asked: Are you arguing then that the President s decision in that regard is unreviewable (by a court)? Flentje s answer was yes. In other words, Flentje argues that Trump can do what s necessary in his judgement to keep the U.S. safe, and a court can t say otherwise. That s part of what Robart weighed when he blocked the Muslim ban. The 9th Circuit will end up on Trump s radar here pretty quickly if they uphold Robart s decision.Then Gorsuch will have to determine whether he wants to serve on a court that s going to be the subject of juvenile attacks when they rule in a way that Trump doesn t like. His confirmation hearing is coming up. He probably won t withdraw, but he has a lot to think about right now.Read more:Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,8-Feb-17
 Sean Spicer Dreams Up Brand-New Fake Terrorist Attack To Defend Trump’s Muslim Ban,"As if we didn t already have enough proof that Trump s administration is full of pathological, compulsive liars, along comes Sean Spicer with yet more. It s not his defense of Kellyanne Conway s mysteriously non-existent terror attack at Bowling Green that lands him on the growing mountain of lies. Rather, it s that he himself has referenced an imaginary terror attack multiple times.CNN put together a short list of Spicer s references to a terror attack in Atlanta that never happened:The first timeHere s what Spicer told ABC s  This Week  on January 29 while defending the President s travel ban: What do we say to the family who loses somebody over a terroristic (sic)   to whether it s Atlanta or San Bernardino or the Boston bomber? Those people, each of whom had gone out to a country and then come back,  Spicer said.The second timeThe next day, Spicer appeared on MSNBC s  Morning Joe  and also mentioned Atlanta while defending the travel ban: There was a very short period of time in which we had something to execute that ensured that the people of the United States were safe. Everybody s been protected,  Spicer said.  What happened if we didn t act and somebody was killed?   Too many of these cases that have happened   whether you re talking about San Bernardino, Atlanta   Boston   would you wait until you do? The answer is we act now to protect the future. The third timeAnd in his January 30 press briefing, Spicer once again alluded to an Atlanta terror attack. When asked by a reporter why some countries linked to terrorism aren t on the travel ban list, Spicer responded: Right, and we re reviewing the entire process over this period of time to make sure that we do this right. But I don t think you have to look any further than the families of the Boston Marathon, in Atlanta, in San Bernardino to ask if we can go further. CNN has been unable to reach Spicer for comment, but some speculate that he might actually be referring to Orlando. The only problem is, he keeps saying Atlanta and it s not like the Orlando massacre was a small, minor incident where such a misstep might be understandable. The last known terror attacks in Atlanta were at the 1996 Olympics, and at a lesbian club in 1997. Both happened at the hands of a right-wing American terrorist.In other words, they weren t attacks by radical Muslims. And there have been no other acts of terrorism in Atlanta. Yet here s Spicer, saying  Atlanta  over and over again to defend Trump s Muslim ban.The Orlando attack, by contrast, was a massacre, and it s not like nobody can remember it. Odd mistake to make, if that s what s even happening.Maybe he s talking about tighter security in Atlanta following last year s terror attack in Brussels? That s not especially likely, either. When he finally gets a story together, he ll talk to the press. Or he ll ignore anything that has to do with his references to Atlanta. But, like Kellyanne Conway, he said it, and then repeated it. It s hard to believe that s just a misspoken word.Read more:Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,8-Feb-17
" Coretta Scott King’s Daughter Speaks Up And AGAINST Republicans, And It’s Brilliantly BRUTAL","When it comes to strategizing an offense against Donald Trump and the Republicans, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King s daughter Bernice King might just be on to something.While the words and actions of Trump are horrific all by themselves, it s important to remember that he is not working alone. He has the support of those working closely around him and the support of the Republican party. So far, they ve been backing his ideas and confirming all his nominations for his Cabinet.Here s what King has to say about all of this:Some Wise Advice Circulating:1. Use [Trump s] name sparingly so as not to detract from the issues. I believe that everyone, regardless of their beliefs, deserves the dignity of being called by their name. However, this is a strategic tactic. While we are so focused on him we are prone to neglect the questionable policies that threaten freedom, justice and fairness advanced by the administration.2. Remember this is a regime and he s not acting alone;3. Do not argue with those who support him and his policies it doesn t work;4. Focus on his policies, not his appearance and mental state;5. Keep your message positive; those who oppose peace and justice want the country to be angry and fearful because this is the soil from which their darkest policies will grow;6. No more helpless/hopeless talk;7. Support artists and the arts;8. Be careful not to spread fake news. Check it;9. Take care of yourselves; and10. Resist!Keep demonstrations peaceful. In the words of John Lennon,  When it gets down to having to use violence, then you are playing the system s game. The establishment will irritate you   pull your beard, flick your face   to make you fight! Because once they ve got you violent, then they know how to handle you. The only thing they don t know how to handle is non-violence and humor. When you post or talk about him, don t assign his actions to him, assign them to  The Republican Administration,  or  The Republicans.  This will have several effects: the Republican legislators will either have to take responsibility for their association with him or stand up for what some of them don t like; he will not get the focus of attention he craves; Republican representatives will become very concerned about their re-elections.  King posts this only one day after Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) got shut down by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on the Senate floor for reading Coretta Scott King s letter from 30 years ago condemning Jeff Sessions.It s time to remember that it s not only Trump we have the responsibility to hold accountable, but all Republicans, and this post from Bernice King is definitely a good start.Read more:Featured Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images",News,8-Feb-17
 WATCH: Sean Spicer Spits On Coretta Scott King’s Grave In Defense Of Jeff Sessions,"Donald Trump s White House mouthpiece just desecrated an American civil rights icon to defend a racist.Back in 1986, Coretta Scott King wrote a letter in opposition to Ronald Reagan s nomination of Jeff Sessions to a federal judgeship. The widow of Martin Luther King Jr. condemned Sessions for his track record on voting rights and implored Republicans to reject him. They did.Mrs. King died in 2006 but her words against Sessions continue to haunt him to this day as he has been nominated by Trump to be Attorney General, which would give him the power to cripple civil rights and voting rights across this country.King wrote that Sessions  lacks the temperament, fairness, and judgement to be a federal judge  and has  used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens. His attempt to prosecute three civil right activists who were helping black people vote in Alabama  raises serious questions about his commitment to the protections of the voting rights of all American citizens and consequently his fair and unbiased judgement regarding this fundamental right. Based on his record, I believe his confirmation would have a devastating effect on not only the judicial system in Alabama, but also on the progress we have made everywhere toward fulfilling my husband s dream that he envisioned over twenty years ago. Sean Spicer, however, seems to think that if King were alive today, she would just  come around  to supporting Sessions and would change her mind about him.During the daily press briefing, Spicer said  I would respectfully disagree with her assessment of Senator Sessions then and now. His record on civil voting rights, I think, is outstanding. I can only hope that if she were still with us today that after getting to know him that she would share the same view. Spicer went on to lie his ass off about Sessions, painting him as a civil rights hero when the fact is that Sessions is the man who didn t mind the KKK until he found out that they smoked pot. He didn t seem to give a damn about the history of lynching and racism the KKK is responsible for.Here s the video via Twitter.Ugh. Spicer desecrates Coretta Scott King, tells string of lies about Sessions pic.twitter.com/65nqBjIcFY  Tommy Christopher (@tommyxtopher) February 8, 2017There has been fierce opposition to Sessions ever since Trump nominated him. The KKK endorsed Trump and cheered his decision when he announced Sessions as his pick to head the Justice Department. Clearly, racists see Sessions as their chance to roll back critical civil and voting rights protections for minorities.If Coretta Scott King were alive today, it is unlikely she would join the KKK by endorsing Sessions. She would still oppose Jeff Sessions and so should every American who believes in liberty and justice for ALL. Because if Jeff Sessions is confirmed, he will take the justice out of the Justice Department and all the progress made by real civil rights heroes will be erased.Read more:Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,8-Feb-17
 This Bill Would Get Trump The Psychiatric Care He So Desperately Needs,"Donald Trump is crazy. I don t say this flippantly. I don t say this as an insult to people who have struggled with their mental health. I also don t say this as a licensed mental health professional. But as someone who has been around a lot of people with serious mental illnesses over the years, I do say that this man is f*cking nuts. And apparently, I m not the only one who thinks this. One Democratic lawmaker is taking action to get Trump some psychiatric care.Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) is planning to introduce a bill as early as next week that would require an in-house White House psychiatrist. His reasoning is clear, the man running our country is in desperate need of psychiatric help. I m looking at it from the perspective of, if there are questions about the mental health of the president of the United States, what may be the best way to get the president treatment?  Lieu explained.This isn t the first time Lieu has let it be known that he is worried about Trump s mental health. Over the weekend he sent out a tweet suggesting that Trump needs to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.Last 24 hrs on Twitter, @realDonaldTrump went on rant about  death & destruction,   FAKE NEWS,  &  evil.  Should he get mental health exam?  Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) February 4, 2017Lieu insists that Trump s behavior  is not normal.  He also argues that Trump is clearly disconnected from reality. It is not normal for the president of the United States, within 24 hours, to write about death and destruction and fake news and evil,  he said.  The most troubling aspect of this is it is very clear he has a disconnection from the truth.   The very first press conference he had in this administration, they could have talked about jobs or health care. They talked about crowd size. And then lied about it. It s one of the most bizarre events I ve witnessed in politics. His disconnection from the truth is incredibly disturbing.   When you add on top of that his stifling of dissent, his attacks on the free press and his attacks on the legitimacy of judiciary, that then takes us down the road toward authoritarianism. That s why I ve concluded he is a danger to the republic,  Lieu argued.Not surprisingly, Lieu isn t the only lawmaker who is a little worried about the fact that our commander-in-chief is bat-shit crazy. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have both publicly questioned Trump s mental health.Read more: Featured image via Andrew Harrer   Pool/Getty Images",News,8-Feb-17
 Trump Blasted Nordstrom For Dropping Ivanka’s Brand. The Company’s Response Is PERFECT (TWEET),"It is absolutely insane how much one man can screw up, but Donald Trump has exceeded all expectations. Not only is he well on his way to ruining an entire country (and already has made a pretty big dent in that goal), but he has singlehandedly brought down the value of his own brand thanks to his idiocy and unpopular rhetoric.The Trump name is now so hated that even his most beloved family member, his daughter Ivanka, is suffering for her father s madness and erratic behavior. Recently, retail giant Nordstrom decided to pull Ivanka s brand from its inventory due to declining sales, and a pesky anti-Trump boycotting campaign called  Grab Your Wallet.  Here s what Nordtrom s president, Pete Nordstrom, had originally said about dropping Ivanka s line: This is a sharply divisive subject. No matter what we do, we are going to end up disappointing some of our customers. Every single brand we offer is evaluated on their results   if people don t buy it, we won t sell it. In response, Trump threw an insane temper tantrum and tweeted this: My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person   always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! The company has now responded, and the way they handled it was perfect. Indirectly addressing Trump s immature response to their decision to drop Ivanka s brand, Nordstrom issued a brilliantly diplomatic statement that remained professional without feeding Trump s insane narcissistic need for attention..@PressSec says @Nordstrom removing Ivanka s clothing line was an attack on Trump family. This is what company says. pic.twitter.com/5i7zhuGBgv  Jeff Zeleny (@jeffzeleny) February 8, 2017It s a subtle hit at Trump, despite not ever acknowledging Trump himself. We all know that the reason Ivanka s sales were declining over the past year is because of The Donald and his disgraceful behavior   much like the decline of popularity in his own hotels. Sadly for the man-baby POTUS, Trump only has himself to blame for this one!Read more:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,8-Feb-17
 Trump Tweets Fake List Of ‘Fake News’ The Media Has Run And Gets STOMPED By Twitter (TWEETS),"On Wednesday, Donald Trump once again lashed out at the media with a scathing article about 16  fake news  stories that have been published since Trump became President*.'16 Fake News Stories Reporters Have Run Since Trump Won' https://t.co/0dHld5kiVc  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017The site featuring the list, The Federalist, is a known purveyor of right-wing hoaxes and is about as reliable as Betsy DeVos in any of the many bear attacks that occur in our schools year-round, but Trump saw a headline he liked and tweeted it out because, to him, fact-checking is a waste of time. Besides, Trump is in the middle of the largest anti-media campaign since Adolf Hitler went out of his way to discredit the media to allow him to more effectively consolidate power   and this article aids that goal nicely:We are in the midst of an epidemic of fake news. There is no better word to describe it than  epidemic,  insofar as it fits the epidemiological model from the Centers for Disease Control: this phenomenon occurs when  an agent and susceptible hosts are present in adequate numbers, and the agent can be effectively conveyed from a source to the susceptible hosts. The  agent  in this case is hysteria over Trump s presidency, and the  susceptible hosts  are a slipshod, reckless, and breathtakingly gullible media class that spread the hysteria around like well, like a virus.It is difficult to adequately sum up the breadth of this epidemic, chiefly because it keeps growing: day after day, even hour after hour, the media continue to broadcast, spread, promulgate, publicize, and promote fake news on an industrial scale. It has become a regular part of our news cycle, not distinct from or extraneous to it but a part of it, embedded within the news apparatus as a spoke is embedded in a bicycle wheel.Whenever you turn on a news station, visit a news website, or check in on a journalist or media personality on Twitter or Facebook, there is an excellent chance you will be exposed to fake news. It is rapidly becoming an accepted part of the way the American media are run.The list that follows, unsurprisingly, contains stories with mostly minor errors that were all corrected quickly because that s how it works when initial reporting is incorrect. Others are simply stuff Donald Trump has done that The Federalist elected to simply say are  fake news    like his threat to send troops into Mexico, Trump s decision to ease sanctions on Russia, and the GOP rolling back Obama-era regulations that prevent the mentally ill from owning guns.Fortunately, not everyone is as stupid as Trump s followers and The Donald was quickly called out for sharing this list from such a disreputable source:Oh for Pete s sake.

Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) February 8, 2017Though he says the phrase a lot, even Trump likely doesn t actually believe the things he falsely calls  fake news  are fake news. Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, explained Monday that the administration will keep using the term until the media realizes they are wrong for attacking Trump with facts. There is a monumental desire on behalf of the majority of the media, not just the pollsters, the majority of the media to attack a duly elected President in the second week of his term,  he says. That s how unhealthy the situation is and until the media understands how wrong that attitude is, and how it hurts their credibility, we are going to continue to say,  fake news . Gorka is a former editor for white supremacist propaganda website Breitbart, which President Steve Bannon used to run.Yes, fake news exists. You usually see it on sites like nbc.com.co.qwdsff4wf.org. But none of these stories, even the ones with errors, earn that classification. What does qualify as  fake news  is President Asterisk s claim that President Obama was born in Kenya, that millions voted illegally for his opponent, and that anyone who disagrees with Donald Trump or says anything unflattering about him is pushing  fake news.

 WATCH: Ted Cruz Claims Democrats Are “The Party Of The KKK” And Gets Instantly OWNED With Facts,"Ted Cruz decided to smear present-day Democrats as supporters of the Ku Klux Klan in defense of Jeff Sessions, and it spectacularly backfired.When Donald Trump nominated Sessions for Attorney General, an uproar ensued because of Sessions  racism over the course of his career.As a United States attorney, Sessions attempted to suppress the black vote in Alabama by prosecuting three civil rights activists for helping black people vote.Sessions  racism is so bad that Republicans rejected his nomination for a judgeship in 1986. Even Coretta Scott King strenuously opposed his nomination in a letter that has since resurfaced.King wrote that Sessions  lacks the temperament, fairness, and judgement to be a federal judge  and has  used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens. She continued by warning that Sessions  would irreparably damage the work of my husband. When Senator Elizabeth Warren attempted to read the letter on the Senate floor on Tuesday, Republicans silenced her in defense of their racist colleague, who if confirmed, would gut the Justice Department and prevent it from protecting civil rights and voting rights.Cruz joined his colleagues in silencing Warren and he defended Sessions during an interview on Fox News by trying to link Democrats with the KKK. It s one of the crutches  when the left doesn t have any other arguments, they go and just accuse everyone of being a racist. The Democrats are the party of the Ku Klux Klan. You look at the most racist  you look at the Dixiecrats, they were Democrats who imposed segregation, imposed Jim Crow laws, who founded the Klan. The Klan was founded by a great many Democrats. Now, the Democrats accuse anyone they disagree with of being a racist. That was a false smear of Jeff Sessions and I think he will make an extraordinary attorney general. Here s the video via YouTube:While it s true that Democrats of the past did, indeed, support the KKK, it should be noted that the Dixiecrats Cruz speaks of became Republicans after Democrats pushed for passage of the Civil Rights Act. Later on, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan would employ the  Southern Strategy  to complete the Republican abandonment of Abraham Lincoln.Democrats have worked hard over the last 70 years to recover from their racist history, and have successfully done so by passing landmark legislation protecting voting rights and civil rights.Cruz is also wrong about Democrats being  the party of the KKK.  That claim may have worked in 1870 or in 1930, but it definitely won t work today, especially since the KKK formally endorsed Donald Trump and celebrated after Trump nominated Sessions.In fact, Sessions once said that he liked the KKK until he found out that they smoked marijuana. Apparently he had no problem with their racism and hate and terrorism against black people.In response, Twitter users roasted Cruz.#morningjoe Ted Cruz said democrats are the KKK. The Republicans have nominated KKK leaders. Who represents the KKK now?

 WH Official: We Will Keep Saying ‘Fake News’ Until The Media Is Nicer To Trump,"Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to Donald Trump, doesn t like the media  attacking  the alleged president just two weeks into office. Trump has screwed up big time but Gorka seems to believe there s a rest period from the media for a newly minted president.On Monday, Gorka said that the Trump administration will continue using the term  fake news  until the media understands that their  monumental desire  to attack Trump is wrong, according to Fox6Now. Gorka is a former Breitbart editor, a site dedicated to promoting  fake news. There is a monumental desire on behalf of the majority of the media, not just the pollsters, the majority of the media to attack a duly elected President in the second week of his term,  Gorka told conservative radio host Michael Medved. The host, for the record, blasted Trump before the election as  insecure, unprepared and angrily unhinged. That s how unhealthy the situation is and until the media understands how wrong that attitude is, and how it hurts their credibility, we are going to continue to say,  fake news.  I m sorry, Michael. That s the reality,  he added.Team Trump repeatedly uses the term  fake news  to discredit the press and media outlets. The crybaby-in-chief even called negative poll numbers  fake news  on Monday. Each time Trump and his administration call CNN or the New York Times  fake news,  they offer no proof of any deceptive reporting.Medved asked Gorka if he would admit that the administration s controversial statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day was  at least questionable in being the first such statement in many years that didn t recognize that Jewish extermination was the chief goal of the Holocaust. It s a Holocaust remembrance statement,  Gorka said.  No, I m not going to admit it. Because it s asinine. It s absurd. You re making a statement about the Holocaust. Of course it s about the Holocaust because that s what the statement s about. It s only reasonable to twist it if your objective is to attack the President. A caller told Gorka, every time you call everything fake news, it just turns everyone except your hardcore fans off. Not everything s fake news,  the caller added. You know, I would beg to differ,  Gorka said.  Every single organ that generates these kinds of stories comes from the same clique of media organs that predicted that Hillary (Clinton) would win and that Brexit wouldn t occur. I know what fake news is. And it s coming from those organizations. It s time that you yourself understood that as well. Gorka is the second Breitbart employee brought into the White House. Steve Bannon was the head honcho of the right wing propaganda outlet. The Trump administration is fake news.Image via Twitter.",News,8-Feb-17

 Trump Loses His Sh*t After Nordstrom Stops Peddling Ivanka’s Sh*tty Product Line,"Donald Trump should not be lashing out like this. It s embarrassing.After months of boycotts and protests, Nordstrom and several other retailers have dropped Ivanka Trump s product line from their inventory.The  Grab Your Wallet  campaign has only been growing since Trump won the election the Russians rigged in November. The campaign began as a protest against Trump over his  grab them by the p*ssy  remark. This is a sharply divisive subject,  Nordstrom co-president Pete Nordstrom said.  No matter what we do, we are going to end up disappointing some of our customers. Every single brand we offer is evaluated on their results   if people don t buy it, we won t sell it. And so, Americans across the country listened and stopped buying from Nordstrom, forcing them to make a choice. They can die as a company defending the Trump brand, or they can survive by dumping it.Nordstrom made the smart choice, and now Donald Trump is pissed.My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person   always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017If Trump didn t want his daughter s business to be negatively affected by his campaign and presidency, he should have stayed out of it to begin with.

That s a clear conflict of interest.But Nordstrom is far from being the only retailer to ditch Ivanka. As Raw Story points outs, Home Shopping Network, Retailers Belk, Neiman Marcus, Jet and ShopStyle have all dropped her this week.Donald Trump is truly pathetic. It s one thing to criticize companies for outsourcing jobs, it something entirely different, however, to criticize a business for deciding what products to sell. And Trump is definitely trying to punish Nordstrom for not continuing to sell Ivanka s product line. Of course, Ivanka s products are made overseas, which makes Trump a hypocrite, too.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,8-Feb-17
 Trump Gets TORCHED After Hypocritically Whining About Democratic Obstruction,"Donald Trump is throwing a hissy fit because Democrats are blocking many of his Cabinet nominees. But he should be blaming Republicans instead.Trump has chosen nominees who want to destroy the departments they have been picked to lead and they are mostly unqualified to hold the positions.But those are not the only reasons why Democrats are putting up a fight.For eight years, Republicans frequently obstructed President Obama s nominees and any legislation Democrats proposed. And for nearly a whole year, Republicans blocked Obama s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland from taking his rightful place on the high court.The obstruction was unprecedented in American history, yet Republicans and Trump are whining because Democrats are doing the exact same thing to them. .On Tuesday, Trump took to Twitter to complain like a hypocrite.It is a disgrace that my full Cabinet is still not in place, the longest such delay in the history of our country. Obstruction by Democrats!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017Again, Republicans blocked Garland s nomination for nearly a year even though he was totally qualified and had received praise from GOP lawmakers. Garland was also considered a moderate choice for the court. Furthermore, Republicans blocked an Obama nominee for years from taking her place as Ambassador to the Bahamas and she died waiting to serve her country.So while Republicans are throwing a temper tantrum over Democratic obstruction, they really only have themselves to blame. For eight years, they viciously blocked legislation and nominees because they hated President Obama. And they hated him because he has black skin. If Donald Trump wants to bitch about obstructionism he should blame Republicans for setting the precedent.Also, Trump is lying because President Obama didn t have his full Cabinet in place until April.And Twitter was quick to remind him of it.@realDonaldTrump This is what happens when your party sets a new standard for obstructionism   the other side has to escalate to compensate.

 Trump’s Disastrously-Misspelled Terrorist Attack List Earns Him A Smackdown From The DICTIONARY (TWEETS),"When Trump s White House released a list of terrorist attacks they say the media did not cover, one thing was clear: the dictionary is the Trump administration s worst enemy.

 McConnell’s Senate Floor Sexism Just Gave Us The Best Protest Cry Yet (TWEETS),"The GOP likes to pretend that they have no issue with women, but it couldn t be clearer that this is a bold-faced lie. The issue was brought front and center when Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) invoked an obscure, rarely used Senate rule in order to silence Senator Elizabeth Warren when she was reading a letter from the late civil rights icon and wife of Martin Luther King Jr Coretta Scott King. The letter was entered into the Senate record in 1986, when Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) was rejected by the Senate for a federal judgeship because he is clearly a racist. Now, Sessions is on the cusp of becoming the Attorney General   the chief law enforcement officer and the person charged with protecting the civil rights of all.When rebuking Senator Warren in the most sexist terms imaginable, McConnell said: She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted. Of course, in the age of social media, McConnell s appalling actions and remarks spread like wildfire. #ShePersisted immediately went viral on Twitter and Facebook, as did #LetLizSpeak. #CorettaScottKing trended as well. Of course, it is not lost that McConnell s sexist Senate Floor behavior comes just a couple of weeks after the women of this nation marched in solidarity in what is perhaps the biggest protest in United States history. Surely he didn t mean to, but McConnell just gave us all an awesome feminist rallying cry, and his own words are already being used against him, and will likely be seen on protest signs around the nation this weekend.Hell, they are already on t-shirts and iPhone covers.

 WATCH: Jake Tapper BURIES Kellanne Conway For Lies And Hypocrisy About Terrorism Coverage,"Jake Tapper laid into Kellyanne Conway on Tuesday over Donald Trump s claim that the media is covering up terrorist attacks.On Monday, Trump literally accused the media of ignoring terrorist attacks to keep the American people in the dark and to keep them in opposition to his Muslim ban. It s gotten to a point where it s not even being reported,  Trump told U.S. Central Command.  And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that. Except that the media has covered lots of terrorist attacks over the years, most of them extensively and journalists have risked their lives to report on some of them.Trump released a list of supposed undercovered terrorist attacks and the list somehow included Paris, Nice, and San Bernardino among other significant attacks even though the media exhaustively covered them.So CNN let Conway appear again on the network to answer for Trump s lies, and they apparently did that so she could get her ass handed to her by Jake Tapper.During the interview, Tapper demanded to know why Trump won t stop lying and refused to take Conway s bullshit when she attempted to spin. After he said that, the White House released a list of the attacks that he was supposedly referring to as, in his words, not even being reported, I want to put some footage of CNN reporters covering attacks that were on that list,  Tapper said.  Saying that we don t cover terrorism, that s just false. And, indeed, he did put the footage up and forced Conway to concede that not only did CNN cover many of the attacks on the list, they did a good job doing it.But Conway still tried to claim that Trump was somehow making a point by including those attacks and she soon began whining about how the media has covered Trump from the campaign trail to the White House.Apparently, the Wicked Witch of the West expected all the media coverage to be one big cheerleading squad for the Trump administration.That didn t fly with Tapper. That s a lovely spin, but that s not what he was saying Kellyanne,  Tapper said, reminding her that Trump literally accused the media of not reporting on these attacks.And then Tapper went for the jugular and demanded to know why Trump has remained silent about a terrorist attack in Quebec, Canada that was committed against a mosque by a white right-wing Trump fan. President Trump has not said or tweeted one public word about this,  Tapper said.  You want to talk about ignoring terrorism, why hasn t the president offered his sympathy to our neighbors in the north? Mic. Dropped.Conway tried to claim that Trump is opposed to any loss of life, but the fact is that while he constantly whines about petty things on Twitter on a daily basis, he couldn t even be bothered to say anything about the attack in Quebec. In fact, all of the terrorist attacks Trump listed were committed by Muslim extremists, conveniently ignoring the higher number of terrorist attacks committed by white right-wingers in this country.Tapper even noted that Trump found time to tweet about the attack at the Louvre in Paris in which no lives were lost but completely ignored the Quebec attack that killed six innocent people.Here s the video via YouTube.Seriously, CNN and every other media outlets should permanently ban Kellyanne Conway from appearing on their programming. Even when confronted with the truth she continues to lie for Donald Trump and then spins by whining about media coverage. It s the only play she has in her playbook and it is embarrassing and pathetic.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,8-Feb-17
 Yemen Just Told Trump to Stay The F*ck Out Of Their Country After Disastrous FAILURE Of A Raid,"Donald Trump may call his disaster of a raid in Yemen last week a  success,  but the rest of the world views it as just one of the more deadly ways in which he has demonstrated his ineptitude   and now we are paying the price.Not only did Trump completely miss his main target, Qassim al-Rimi,  who is currently mocking him, but the poorly-planned raid slaughtered 30 civilians including 10 women and children (one of them a U.S. citizen). Three U.S. service members were injured and a Navy SEAL was killed.So what went wrong? Everything.Trump reportedly decided to go ahead with the raid over dinner after his cabinet convinced him it was the right thing to do by telling him that Obama would not have the balls to go through with him (seriously, that s all it took). According to a senior U.S. intelligence official,  almost everything went wrong  once the team arrived. Officials say Trump approved the attack without sufficient intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations.  On top of failing to kill his target, slaughtering civilians wholesale, murdering a U.S. citizen, and getting a SEAL killed with his bumbling mess of an operation, the intel that was gathered is garbage. The military is touting three videos they recovered from the raid as evidence of success   but the videos are a decade old and available on YouTube.Because of all this, Yemen has decided that they don t want Trump coming in and wrecking their living room again. The New York Times reports:Angry at the civilian casualties incurred last month in the first commando raid authorized by President Trump, Yemen has withdrawn permission for the United States to run Special Operations ground missions against suspected terrorist groups in the country, according to American officials.Grisly photographs of children apparently killed in the crossfire of a 50-minute firefight during the raid caused outrage in Yemen. A member of the Navy s SEAL Team 6, Chief Petty Officer William Owens, was also killed in the operation.While the White House continues to insist that the attack was a  success    a characterization it repeated on Tuesday   the suspension of commando operations is a setback for Mr. Trump, who has made it clear he plans to take a far more aggressive approach against Islamic militants. The fool of the White House got slapped at the beginning of his road in your lands, al-Rimi said in a video following Trump s failed raid. Yemen s decision not to let Trump play with his toys in their house is a bit uncomfortable for The Donald, who promised to step up our approach to fighting terrorism. Now that he is President, he has done nothing but hurt that effort.Watch a report on the raid below:Featured image via Getty Images/Pool",News,8-Feb-17
 DOJ Lawyers LITERALLY Argued That Trump Is Above The Law And Untouchable By Any Court (AUDIO),"You know how white supremacists have been calling Trump their  God-Emperor? Apparently, that has gone to The Donald s head, as his DOJ lawyers actually argued that he is completely untouchable by any court and his decisions are absolute.On Tuesday, August Flentje, Special Counsel to the Assistant U.S. Attorney General, was asked a question that should have been an automatic  no    Does the President have unchecked power? Are you arguing then that the president s decision in that regard is unreviewable?  Judge Michelle T. Friedland asked Flentje at one point in the Trump administration s attempt to get the Muslim ban back up and running. To most, the idea of any leader having unlimited and absolute power in any area of the government is frightening, but to the Trump administration it s just the way things should be.Flentje hesitated briefly, then provided a single-word answer that reveals everything you need to know about the mindset of Trump and his team of white supremacists, Christofascists, and other Deplorables:  Yes.

 Mitch McConnell VICIOUSLY Cuts Off Elizabeth Warren To Defend Racism (VIDEO),"Another girl hurt a Republican s feelings. This time, it was Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) who dropped a truth bomb on the GOP, which was too much for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to handle. Trump s pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala) is being scrutinized for some very obvious reasons. His history speaks for itself.Then this happened:McConnell took particular issue with Warren quoting a letter written by Coretta Scott King, Martin Luther King Jr. s widow, when Sessions was under consideration for a federal judgeship in 1986.McConnell invoked the little-used Rule XIX, which says that  No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.  King s letter argues that, during his time as a prosecutor in Alabama,  Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens.  It was that portion of the letter that McConnell read back to the presiding officer, arguing that it was over the line.Sen. Steve Daines (R-Montana) agreed with McConnell, ruling her in violation of the order and forcing her to sit down. Because of course he did. I am surprised that the words of Coretta Scott King are not suitable for debate in the United States Senate,  Warren declared.Still yet, Republicans prevailed after a vote was held on Warren s appeal of the ruling of the chair.According to the rules, Warren would be barred from speaking during the remaining 30 hours of the Sessions debate.Even so, Democrats asked that Warren s speaking privileges be restored.Watch:Democrats held the floor for 24 hours to protest Sessions  nomination just as they did in advance of Betsy Devos  confirmation. Warren was part of that effort.Read more:Image via screen capture.",News,7-Feb-17
 CNN Just Laid An EPIC SMACKDOWN Down On Sean Spicer Over Kellyanne Conway’s Credibility (VIDEO),"Not too long after CNN said they would no longer host Kellyanne Conway on their shows due to legitimate questions about her credibility (remember the Bowling Green massacre we all died at?), she loudly proclaimed that to be a lie, and said she turned down the Sunday shows due to family obligations.False. I could do no live Sunday shows this week BC of family. Plus, I was invited onto CNN today & tomorrow. CNN Brass on those emails https://t.co/LVOUWIytLK  Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) February 6, 2017During the daily White House press briefing, Sean Spicer fielded a question about that and he said it was his  understanding that they retracted that   that they walked that back. CNN wasn t having it. They know what they said and they know why they said it. Almost immediately after Spicer said that, CNN tweeted:In response to @PressSec s comment today: pic.twitter.com/2IdzeyDEU5  CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 7, 2017Following her skewering over the  Bowling Green massacre  that literally never happened (and wasn t even a foiled attack), Conway tried her damnedest to claim the press was being mean to her because she  misspoke one word.  The problem with that is she didn t misspeak at all   she s referenced the massacre where she died, too, in the past (and really, who didn t die that day?). In fact, she made it a bigger lie with bigger alternative facts before: [Obama banned Iraqi refugees], it s a fact. Why did he do that? He did that for exactly the same reasons. He did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills, and come back here, and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers  lives away. But Spicer, who doesn t have much in the way of credibility himself, stood staunchly by her, calling her a  very trusted aide,  and complaining that CNN s characterization of her was insulting.Please.It s insulting that she goes on all these news shows and spins lie after lie after lie like all of America is incapable of using Google.Watch him defend her below: Read more:Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,7-Feb-17
 Republican Lawmaker Introduces Bill To Eliminate The Department Of Education Entirely,"Republicans are apparently hell-bent on destroying public education any way they can. The Senate confirmed Betsy DeVos as secretary of education in a 51-50 vote on Tuesday. And as if that weren t enough, a GOP representative introduced a bill to do away with the Department of Education entirely.Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie introduced the one-page bill, which states that the Department of Education would terminate on Dec. 31, 2018. Now, to be honest, I could understand if this were a panicked, knee-jerk reaction to DeVos  confirmation. Kind of a  smoosh it before it lays eggs  response. It wouldn t make it a good idea, but it would be understandable. Sadly, that doesn t appear to be the case at all.Massie wants to eliminate the agency, which has been in place since 1980, because he just doesn t think the federal government should be in charge of education. Instead, he thinks the issue would best be left to states and local municipalities. (Insert eye roll here.) Unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. should not be in charge of our children s intellectual and moral development. States and local communities are best positioned to shape curricula that meet the needs of their students,  Massie said in a statement.Massie isn t alone on this one, as seven other Republicans have also signed onto his bill: House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (Utah) and Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Jody Hice (Ga.), Walter Jones (N.C.) and Ra l Labrador (Idaho).The bill was introduced shortly after Vice President Mike Pence cast his tie-breaking to confirm DeVos. All Democrats voted against her and two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), broke ranks with their party and opposed her confirmation as well. Unfortunately, it was not enough to keep this blithering idiot from being confirmed as education secretary.Unfortunately, it was not enough to keep this blithering idiot from being confirmed as education secretary. And now, Republicans are trying to sabotage public education by abolishing the Department of Education entirely. Lovely.Read more:Featured image via T.J. Kirkpatrick/Getty Images",News,7-Feb-17
 WATCH: Donald Trump Literally Offers To ‘Destroy’ A State Senator’s Career,"After a Texas sheriff whined about a piece of legislation, Donald Trump seriously offered to  destroy  the lawmaker who wrote it.Texas Republican Senator Bob Hall represents Rockwall County, and he plans to introduce a bill that prevents police from seizing assets unless there is a conviction first.Basically, the legislation allows suspects who are arrested to keep their property and finances intact until they are formally convicted of their alleged crimes by a court of law.It makes sense, but Rockwall County Sheriff Harold Eavenson complained to Trump at a meeting on Tuesday that Hall s bill isn t the kind of cooperation he has been demanding. In short, the two bit sheriff thinks he can give orders to lawmakers. In response to Eavenson s whining, Trump asked him to name the lawmaker and offered to  destroy  his career. Everyone else laughed as if Trump was joking. Trump didn t laugh with them. He was being quite serious.EAVENSON: On asset state forfeiture, we got a state senator in Texas that was talking about introducing legislation to require conviction before we could receive that forfeiture money. And I told him that the cartel would give a monument to him in Mexico if he could get that legislation passed.TRUMP: Who is the state senator? Do you want to give his name? We ll destroy his career.Here s the video via Twitter.Sheriff tells Trump a lawmaker is pushing legislation he doesn t wantTrump:  Want to give his name? We ll destroy his career. (laughter) pic.twitter.com/7vLFAQOhw0  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 7, 2017So let s just get this straight. Because a state lawmaker plans to introduce a piece of legislation that doesn t jive with Trump s agenda and the agenda of a county sheriff, Trump is threatening to  destroy  the man s career. This is the kind of thing that tyrants do. And what s amazing is that this is a state lawmaker. Frankly, Trump should stay out of local and state affairs of this kind. Surely, the Texas Senate and House can decide if Hall s bill is worthy of passage. Furthermore, voters elected Hall to represent them. If they don t like what he is doing they will destroy him by not re-electing him. Trump isn t only threatening a lawmaker, he is threatening democracy. And he should not be allowed to get away with it.Read more:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,7-Feb-17
 Donald Trump Vote Broke Up This Couple’s Marriage,"The 2016 election has been particularly hard on relationships. Social media is beginning to resemble a large echo chamber, with people with diverse views unfriending each other. It s not hard to imagine that those disagreements would go beyond social media, but it s especially shocking when political differences actually end a marriage.Gayle McCormick is a retired prison guard from California. She describes herself as a  Democrat leaning toward socialist.  Her husband, though, voted for Trump, and for that, their marriage is over. It totally undid me that he could vote for Trump,  said McCormick, 73, who had not thought of leaving the conservative Republican before but felt  betrayed  by his support for Trump. I felt like I had been fooling myself,  she said.  It opened up areas between us I had not faced before. I realised how far I had gone in my life to accept things I would have never accepted when I was younger. Source: IndependentIt might seem silly to leave a 22 year marriage over a political disagreement, but this election was about much more than typical Democrat vs. Republican rancor. We aren t just talking about federal government vs. state government or the size of people s taxes. This election was largely about who we are as people. While it s clear that not everyone who voted for Trump is racist, misogynistic and xenophobic, everyone who voted for Trump doesn t see racism, misogyny and xenophobia as deal breakers.Through accusations of corruption hurled at Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump has shown himself to be far more corrupt than any Clinton could dream of. Trump has been given carte blanche to run the government like a child dictator, tweeting fantasies of revenge over every perceived slight. Donald Trump is toxic. Hell, the world is about to break up with us over Trump s election. It stands to reason that personal relationships wouldn t fare much better.Read more:Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,7-Feb-17
 Kellyanne Conway Embarrasses Herself During Capitol Hill Meeting And Then Runs Away,"Kellyanne Conway was sent to meet with congressional staffers on Capitol Hill. It didn t go well.Conway and Boris Epshteyn apparently spoke to 100 communications staffers representing Republican senators to tell them what roles they are playing in the government, especially since Conway repeatedly lies for Trump on television and clearly has a lot of power in the White House.During one line of questioning, Conway was asked about the 1.5 million Americans who have called the Congressional switchboard to voice their opposition to Donald Trump s Education nominee Betsy DeVos.Conway responded by saying that she only gives a damn about her own  Real Person Impact  meter and suggested that those 1.5 million Americans are not real human beings because they oppose Trump. She basically said the people jamming up the phones don t matter to this White House,  an attendee told Politico.  That this administration just cares about what matters to  real people. The disdain Conway and Trump have against dissenting Americans is absolutely disgraceful. She is literally saying that it doesn t matter what the American people think and that Republicans should just shove their agenda down ours throats.But Conway wasn t done humiliating herself on Capitol Hill.After ridiculing the concerns of Americans about DeVos, a staffer asked about her reaction to Saturday Night Live s skit featuring Melissa McCarthy as Sean Spicer. A staffer said that her  face turned to stone  and she abruptly ended the meeting and ran away like a coward. They definitely did not find it funny,  the source said.  And then they walked out. The White House later disputed the claim and proceeded to brag about how Conway received an ovation from the staffers, something that did NOT happen.Clearly, Trump and his team are still delusional and believe that everyone loves them and what they are doing when, in fact, the exact opposite is the truth.Seriously, Kellyanne Conway has no business working in the White House and she definitely has no business being interviewed by the media. She s a serial liar who makes shit up and whines about any criticism or opposition Trump receives.It s time for her to resign or be fired.Read more:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,7-Feb-17
 Trump’s List Of ‘Unreported Terror Attacks’ Appears To Have Been Written By Drunk Monkeys,"In another of Donald Trump s whine rests, the Dictator in Chief accused the media of not reporting terrorist attacks. On Tuesday, Trump released the list of  unreported terrorist attacks,  which not surprisingly, have been extensively covered by the media. Yes, it s sad that lies from the White House are no longer surprising. What is surprising, though, is how the list was written. It was either done in a sleep deprived flurry from Trump or some drunken monkeys got ahold of a computer.You have to give the White House credit. For complete BS, the list is rather extensive.

We get that the supposed billionaire who sits on 14 carat gold toilets ran as an every man, and let s face it, Americans are notoriously illiterate, but if Trump has this same inattention to detail in his businesses, it s no wonder he s gone bankrupt four times. As for our country, the world is both laughing and weeping   the latter because Trump has the keys to the nuclear arsenal.Read more:Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,7-Feb-17
" Trump Attacks President Obama For Trying To Make Peace With Iran, Denies He Is Putin’s Puppet","Donald Trump is once again whining about the media investigating his ties to Russia, and attacked President Obama in the process.Despite having extensive business ties in Russia and connections to Vladimir Putin, whom he admires, Trump claimed in a Tuesday morning Twitter tantrum that he doesn t know the Russian tyrant nor does he have any deals there. And Trump appeared to try and excuse any deals he may have by attacking President Obama for making a diplomatic deal with Iran.I don t know Putin, have no deals in Russia, and the haters are going crazy   yet Obama can make a deal with Iran, #1 in terror, no problem!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 7, 2017First of all, Trump has plenty of business and financial ties to Russia.According to Time,[F]or all of his denials of Russian ties lately, Trump has boasted in the past of his many meetings with Russian oligarchs. During one trip to Moscow, Trump bragged that they all showed up to meet him to discuss projects around the globe.  Almost all of the oligarchs were in the room  just to meet with him, Trump said at the time.And when Trump built a tower in Panama, his clients were wealthy Russians, the Washington Post reported.  Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia,  Trump s son, Donald Jr., said at a real estate conference in 2008.Trump has also borrowed a lot of money from Russian financial institutions over the years because American banks see him as too much of a risk due to his many bankruptcies.And second, President Obama s deal with Iran was not a business deal or one that President Obama personally profits from. It s a diplomatic deal reached to reduce Iran s nuclear program. In other words, President Obama was doing his job to keep Americans safe, unlike Trump, who has escalated tensions between the United States and Iran along with China since taking office more than two weeks ago.What s truly amazing is that Trump is still whining about being outed for his ties to Russia and Putin. And the fact that he would use President Obama s deal with Iran to justify his personal business deals in Russia is pathetic.And Twitter wiped the floor with him.@realDonaldTrump You mean Americans?

 GOP Rep. Wants You to ‘Look At All The Good’ That Came From The Charleston Massacre (VIDEO),"According to GOP Congressman Sean Duffy, we need to stop talking about terrorist acts committed by white people in the United States and hop on board the Trump Train. During an interview Tuesday morning with CBB s Alisyn Camerota, Duffy completely lost it when asked why the Trump administration seems determined to ignore any and all terrorist acts committed by white people as they focus on banning entry from seven countries that have not produced a deadly terrorist attack within our borders since 9/11. You don t have a group like ISIS or Al Qaeda that s inspiring people around the world to kill innocents,  Duffy said when confronted with white terrorist attacks like the recent mosque massacre in Canada.  That was a one-off.  Pretending that the attack in Canada is the only recent example of a white extremist slaughtering innocents, Duffy continued harping about ISIS. How about the Charleston church shooting, Congressman?  Camerota asked.  He was a white extremist. That doesn t matter?  At this point, things got crazy. Duffy explained that the Charleston massacre matters, but only because because  good things  came from it: It does matter. It does matter. Look at the good things that came from it. Nikki Haley took down the Confederate flag. That was great! Naturally, he didn t mention the numerous African-Americans who were killed, or that the white supremacist who murdered all those people followed the same ideology as he does. This sort of statement is crazy and insulting to the victims and their families and the Congressman s response makes him look awful, but he only managed to get crazier when he claimed that former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who is quite alive, is dead: Look at Gabby Giffords, the Marxist who took her life, a leftist guy, and now you see violence and terror in the streets all across America.

 Hillary Just Joined #TheResistance In BRILLIANT Video Without Even Mentioning Trump,"It s no secret that Hillary Clinton is deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to America. However, as a former major party presidential candidate, she cannot openly and directly criticize him or his administration without looking like a sore loser. That, however, has not stopped the former Democratic presidential nominee from openly signalling that she is opposed to Trump and his policies. In fact, in a recent video, Hillary championed women more loudly than before, praised the Women s Marches around the nation and world. She also made a bold and direct declaration:  The Future is Female. The video was made for the 2017 Makers Conference. Hillary said in her videotaped speech: We need strong women to step up and speak out. Just look at the amazing energy we saw last month as women organised a march that galvanized millions of people in our country and across the world. Now more than ever we need to stay focused on the theme of this year s conference: Be Bold. She ended with an uplifting and inspiring message for women and girls everywhere, as well as other vulnerable communities, who may be worried about their futures under the tyranny of the Trump White House: So please, set an example for every women and girl out there who s worried about what the future holds and wonders whether our rights, opportunities and values will endure. And remember, you are the heroes and history makers, the glass ceiling breakers on the future. Hillary is right. This is why #TheResistance is so important. Trump is a threat to our future, but it is the responsibility of the people to be the guardians of our own democracy. Listen to Hillary   we are the future. Trump is one man, and he doesn t represent us.Watch the brilliant video below: Yes, the future is female.   @HillaryClinton.

 Great Britain’s Government Just Issued An EPIC F**K You To Trump (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is scheduled to make his first state visit to Britain later this year. Since the United Kingdom is one of America s closest and oldest allies, the utmost diplomacy and courtesy is usually afforded when either leader visits the other. That will not be the case during the Trump era, though, if UK House of Commons Speaker John Bercow has anything to say about it. Citing Trump s  racism  and  sexism,  Bercow says that he is against allowing Trump to address the UK s Members of Parliament (MP s).Bercow says that speaking before the distinguished body  is not an automatic right, it is an earned honour.  Many MP s were elated at Bercow s move, while others were irritated and worried that he might be straining relations with an ally that the UK needs in his proposed treatment of Trump. Bercow said of his decision: After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall. I would not wish to issue an invitation to President Trump. Bercow then added passionately: I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons. Labour Party MP Stephen Daughtry offered high praise for Bercow s extraordinary statement: I am delighted that the Speaker has listened to members from across the house regarding our deep concerns that Donald Trump not be honoured with an address in Westminster Hall or elsewhere in the Palace of Westminster, after his comments and actions on women, torture, refugees and the judiciary. Another Labour Party MP, Yvette Cooper, said that Trump has been  continuing his assault on the democratic values that the British Parliament holds dear. This really should come as no surprise, because during the election cycle, the entire British Parliament spent more than three hours excoriating Trump. He was called  crazy,  a  buffoon, a fool,   bonkers,   dangerous,  and more. Regardless of party, the entire House of Commons were in agreement in their contempt for then-candidate Trump. Here is a highlight reel, courtesy of the Washington Post, on that debate:All in all, Trump is ruining relationships for America, likely for years to come, just because of his repugnant personal characteristics. Good on House Speaker Bercow for putting principle above niceties. Hopefully, people continue to support this move. In the meantime, let s hope our allies don t judge all Americans by the actions of one unhinged, illegitimate leader.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,7-Feb-17
 BUSTED: Melania Trump Wanted To Use Her Role As First Lady To Personally Profit,"This is unseemly behavior by a First Lady and it s totally unconstitutional.Donald Trump s wife is throwing a hissy fit because she has allegedly been prevented from personally profiting off being First Lady because of a story alleging that she worked as an escort.Melania Trump filed a seeking $150 million from The Daily Mail, and her attorneys actually admitted that she had hoped to enrich herself and her family by turning the role of First Lady into a sales pitch for her shitty product lines.According to the lawsuit filed in the Manhattan Supreme Court by lawyer Charles Harder, Mail Online s conduct was extreme and outrageous in falsely making the scurrilous charge that the future First Lady of the United States worked as a prostitute. Plaintiff had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as an extremely famous and well-known person to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world.These product categories would have included, among other things, apparel, accessories, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care, skin care and fragrance.The [statements] also constitute defamation per se because they impugned on her fitness to perform her duties as First Lady of the United States. Seriously.Melania Trump literally hoped she could disgrace the role of First Lady by using it to enrich herself.There s just one huge problem.As Raw Story points out, using a government position to personally profit is a violation of the Constitution.It s also sleazy and greedy.The First Lady is supposed to do things to help others, not herself. The Trumps are already filthy rich and they get paid a salary every year as compensation for being in public office. If the Trumps really only sought the presidency in some sort of scheme to enrich themselves, they should leave the office in disgrace before they are impeached or sentenced to prison like former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife, who also tried to use public office to personally profit. Voters and taxpayers did not send Trump to the White House to work for himself and his bank account. They sent him there to work for the American people. And Melania Trump is turning out to be an embarrassment as First Lady just as much as her husband is an embarrassment as president.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,7-Feb-17
 WATCH: Anderson Cooper Wipes The Floor With Trump’s Lies About Coverage Of Terrorist Attacks,"Donald Trump accused the media of covering up terrorist attacks and promptly got his ass handed to him by Anderson Cooper on CNN.On Monday during remarks to U.S. Central Command, Trump claimed that terrorist attacks are happening all over Europe all the time but the media is allegedly not reporting on them just to keep Americans in the dark. All over Europe it s happening,  Trump said.  It s gotten to a point where it s not even being reported. And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that. However, when Trump released a list of terrorist attacks that the media has supposedly ignored, news agencies everywhere laughed.The list of 78 attacks includes those that occurred in San Bernardino, Paris, Orlando, and Nice, just to name a few. The problem is that the media covered these attacks thoroughly on a daily basis for quite some time. And there is video tape to prove it.During his show on Monday night, Cooper played a montage of himself covering many of these attacks and he blasted Trump for lying. Not only did we cover many of the attacks on that list, we covered them heavily. I know, because I was on the ground reporting a number of them. CNN was on the ground in Ottawa, Canada, when a gunman killed someone at the tomb of the unknown soldier. I was in Orlando, I flew there right after the news broke. December 2015, that was on the list, San Bernardino. I was there, 14 people killed and 21 wounded in coordinated attacks. This was just a month after I reported on the carnage in Paris, where terrorists killed 130 people and wounded many others. To be sure, this program did not cover each and every incident on the list, however other programs, as well as CNN International, covered most if not all of them, most of them exhaustively. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump has told lie after lie after lie since taking over the White House and his attacks against the media are childish. There is literally thousands of hours of video of news reporters and anchors covering all of the attacks Trump put on the list. At this point, the media really should take action against Trump. His attacks constitute slander and the media definitely has a strong case.Trump is trying to hype up terrorist attacks in order to scare Americans into supporting his unconstitutional Muslim ban. And he is trying to make it sound like the media is helping the terrorists. If anyone is helping terrorists it s Donald Trump. His Muslim ban is literally being used as propaganda by terrorist organizations as a recruiting tool. He should be ashamed of himself, and if and when a terrorist attack does occur against this country, Trump will be to blame.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,7-Feb-17
 Twitter Has The ULTIMATE Way For SNL To Get Under Trump’s Skin; It Involves ROSIE O’DONNELL,"It s no secret to anyone not living under a rock that there is no love lost between Donald Trump and Rosie O Donnell. It s also no secret that Alec Baldwin s brutal and spot-on mockery of Trump on Saturday Night Live is really getting under Trump s skin, and has been for some time now. However, the ultimate blow came this past Saturday night, when SNL featured a surprise appearance by actress Melissa McCarthy as Trump s bumbling, lying, combative press secretary Sean Spicer. The portrayal stole the show and went viral.While Trump has yet to tweet about it, the word on the street is that what bothered him the most about SNL s treatment of Spicer wasn t the mockery itself, but rather that Spicer was portrayed by a woman. To Trump, that equals making his press secretary look weak.Given this perfect storm of facts sure to be causing the notoriously thin-skinned president wannabe to seethe, Trump s own favorite social media platform, Twitter, has come up with a BRILLIANT way to have SNL finally make Trump REALLY blow his stack: Have Rosie O Donnell portray either Trump himself or   even better   top Trump political strategist Steve Bannon.Bannon is the former head of the white supremacist website Breitbart News, and is clearly the one who is in Trump s ear and pulling the strings behind the scenes. To have him portrayed by the woman Trump hates most in the world would be EPIC. Here are just a few tweets on this subject:I'm begging you @SNL   please get Rosie O'Donnell to play ""President Bannon"" over #BLOTUS. He'll melt like the Wicked Witch! #TheResistance pic.twitter.com/DhaZuvgtvH  Captain Janeway (@CaptJaneway2017) February 7, 2017SNL it's time. Cast Rosie O'Donnell as Bannon, the world needs this.

But imagine the steam shooting out of Trump's ears if Rosie O'Donnell plays him.  Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) February 7, 2017Rosie O'Donnell as Steve Bannon on @nbcsnl would be INCREDIBLE.

" Trump’s List Of ‘Unreported’ Terror Attacks Is Out, And It’s ABSURD (CITATIONS)","Earlier today, Trump said to a crowd at MacDill Air Force Base that the  very dishonest media  wasn t reporting on the terror attacks that are happening all across Europe all the time. Later on, the media pressed Sean Spicer on that topic while aboard Air Force One, and Spicer s response was to say that they d provide a list  later on.  Well, that list is out, and surprise surprise, it s completely ridiculous.Since Trump s comments focused on Europe and, by extension, the U.S., the following lists are focused there, despite many, many other attacks happening around the world.Perhaps one of the most ridiculous things about the White House s list of attacks is that it includes high-profile attacks that were covered for days on end, such as the 2015 attack against Charlie Hebdo in Paris, and the fateful attack at a Paris club in November. It also includes two foiled attacks that were also widely reported. Broken down:They also list several attacks in France in 2016 that were covered extensively.Then they list an attack in London in December 2015 that was covered by CNN, Reuters, The Huffington Post, USA Today, and more.There s one in Copenhagen, Denmark in February of 2015 that was covered by CNN, The New York Times, USA Today, The Huffington Post, Reuters, and more.Most of us probably remember the March 2016 attack in Brussels, Belgium, which was covered by CNN, NPR, The New York Times, CBS News, NBC News, USA Today, ABC News, and more.But that s Europe. What about the attacks they list here in the U.S. that supposedly weren t covered, or weren t covered extensively enough? Like the following:Really? So far we ve looked closely at 18 of the attacks listed, and they were all widely covered by U.S. media. Trump and his minions insist that we re not covering attacks in Europe hardly at all, and then they provide a list with 30 attacks that are in the Middle East, parts of Asia, and in Indonesia and the Philippines.Those attacks are terrible and tragic, too, but again, Trump didn t say anything about us not covering attacks in those regions. He probably didn t even think about those regions until whoever it was that compiled that list gave it to him (if they gave it to him).But the biggest falsehood is that the media isn t reporting, or is underreporting, on these attacks. It s like they hurriedly compiled a list of terror attacks worldwide from Wikipedia and couldn t be bothered to proofread, let alone research. There are spelling errors in addition to the lie that the media covers up attacks. Our dishonest  president,  has a lot of nerve accusing the media of actively covering up terrorist attacks.The full list, as provided to CNN, is below. Feel free to Google whatever you want:Here s the list the White House sent of attacks they feel  did not receive adequate attention from Western media sources.  pic.twitter.com/lj8eOZQfnY  Kevin Liptak (@Kevinliptakcnn) February 7, 2017Read more:Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,6-Feb-17
 Sean Spicer: Donald Trump Does Not Own A Bathrobe (IMAGES),"White House press secretary of Alternative Facts Sean Spicer tried to attack the New York Times over an article detailing disorder in the West Wing over the executive order banning seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. That report details that Trump watches TV in his bathrobe. So naturally, Spicey said the report was inaccurate despite there being several pictures of Trump in a bathrobe which have circulated for quite awhile now. Spicer thinks the New York Times should apologize to the fake president about the bathrobes comment, because feelings. That story was so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the President an apology for the way that thing was written,  he told reporters aboard Air Force One, according to CNN.  There were literally blatant factual errors, and it s unacceptable to see that kind of reporting. Oh, lookie here s another pic of Trump in a bathrobe which he totally doesn t wear:One detail really irked Spice. I don t think the President wears a bathrobe, and definitely doesn t own one,  he said. We re not sure how Spicer knows if Trump wears a bathrobe or not, but we can speculate.The New York Times reported that when  Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone reaching out to old campaign hands and advisers, he will sometimes set off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home. And if this is true, it s even worse for the Crybaby-in-Chief:Spicer also said Trump was fully aware of what his executive orders contain, including one about restructuring the National Security Counsel. The President is clearly aware of the policies that come out of the White House with his name on it,  Spicer declared.Twitter being Twitter, just after Spicer s comments, several Twitter users circulated images of Trump wearing a bathrobe.Spicer: Trump doesn t own a bathrobe / Must be those #AlternativeFacts eh @PressSec ? https://t.co/2IcjViqbWY pic.twitter.com/v0pYLbKhej  4q2 (@ForQ2) February 6, 2017 Sup @POTUS!

" WATCH: Dem Rep. Just BRAZENLY Called Out Trump’s Immaturity, And It’s Simply AMAZING","Democrats are more pissed off with Trump s behavior than Republicans, because Republicans apparently feel they need to march in lockstep with the president when the president is a Republican. Trump s behavior on Twitter, even though he s taken office and is supposed to be acting presidential, is abominable, and some members of Congress are sick of sugarcoating it.Rep. Kathleen Rice spoke to Wolf Blitzer on CNN, where she blasted Trump and his immaturity, and his inability to let personal slights go. She actually told Blitzer that his behavior was worse than juvenile: It s juvenile. It s actually an insult to actual juveniles to say that it s juvenile   I don t even know what category to put this in. Yep, a U.S. Representative went on national cable news to say that Trump is so immature it s insulting to kids to say so. And she s right   he went on a tear against Judge James Robart, the U.S. district judge who blocked Trump s Muslim ban, and even told his followers to blame Robart if something happens, because the decision means that anyone and everyone can just enter the country on a whim.He s repeatedly blasted The New York Times as being fake news (same with CNN). He blasts Saturday Night Live because they make fun of him (who don t they make fun of?). He couldn t let reports that his inauguration numbers were less-than stellar go for nearly two weeks. And the list goes on, and on, and on, ad infinitum and ad nauseam. He can t let anything go, and Rice touched on that, too, when she said: And I m hoping that he stops with the name-calling and the attacking every time someone says   if it s a poll he doesn t like, if it s a comment that he doesn t like, if it s a court decision he doesn t like   that s part of life. Exactly. It s part of life and it s a big part of life when you re a public figure, particularly a public political figure. The fact that she felt she had basically had no words for the level of immaturity Trump shows, and was willing to say so on national television, is very telling. Watch her full comments below:Rep.

" CNN Just Went After Trump For His Latest Meltdown, And It Was Unbelievably BRILLIANT (VIDEO)","Donald Trump has been on an insane Twitter rampage lately, and it s been beyond terrifying for everyone watching. Trump has not only been crying about fake news and the opposition of his disgusting Muslim ban, but his narcissism is clearly out of control.Throughout his transition and beginning weeks of his presidency, Trump has made CNN a target because the news outlet dared to hold his team accountable, and the network just hit back at Trump again. Just days after turning down an interview with Kellyanne Conway because she lacked credibility, CNN s Jake Tapper nailed Trump for his recent tweets and made an absolute mockery of the most undeserving POTUS we ve ever had.Tapper comically said that Trump s tweets are windows into his soul,  right before rattling off several disturbing tweets that Trump had posted recently. The tweets jumped from criticism of the federal judge who blocked his Muslim ban to fake news to negative polls. Throughout the clip, Tapper tries to translate Trump s Twitter babble.Taking on the tweet that said  any negative polls are fake news , Tapper said: Got that. Any polling suggesting anything negative about the president or his policies is not, in his view, real. Tapper also attacked Trump for his comments about the judge that stopped his inhumane Muslim ban, and for spreading inaccurate information about legitimate polls: To sum up, if a judge rules against the president he is a so-called judge. If a poll shows the majority of you disagrees with his policies, the poll is fake. If a well-sourced news story reflects something unflattering about him, that story is fake. Tapper then commented that Trump believes  two fundamental pillars of our democracy  are  not legitimate  if it doesn t work in his favor. Then Tapper asked, Okay. What about a known geopolitical foe of the United States like, say, I don t know, Russian President Vladimir Putin? In the most surprising footage in the clip, Tapper played Trump s disastrous interview with Fox News  Bill O Reilly where Trump praised and defended Russian leader Vladimir Putin and called Americans  killers.  Tapper said what we were all thinking: Whoa! So as long as we all know where we stand, I suppose.

" While You Were Distracted, Republicans Gutted Workers’ Rights In Yet Another State (DETAILS)","On Monday, Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens signed legislation making Missouri the latest  right-to-work  state. Republican governors have done this in order to break into the last remaining strongholds of the labor unions. Gov. Scott Walker (R-WI) started this trend with conservatives. He gutted collective bargaining rights which ended big pay increases for most public workers. His move also required them to pay more for health care and pension benefits. That move set off a wave of protests in the state.Trump will be very giddy about this:Legislation advancing in the New Hampshire capital, if approved, would make the state the first in the Northeast to go  right-to-work.  The measure, which bars unions from forcing employees to join or pay dues, is set for a vote in the state s House next week   after having passed the Senate.The push is the latest sign of labor unions  diminishing clout, and how Republican gains at the state level are having a broad impact on policy, amid support for such legislation from the Trump White House.On Twitter, the Missouri Governor said:Today, I signed Right to Work. This is about more jobs   Missourians are ready to work, and now our state is open for business! pic.twitter.com/xM4zY71RH1  Eric Greitens (@EricGreitens) February 6, 2017State Republican Rep. Stephen Schmidt, chairman of the House labor committee, explained that there are some Republicans who are not supporting the right-to-work bill. Schmidt said he backs the bill but isn t sure it will pass. I believe it will be a very tight vote one way or another,  he said. This bill will silence the teachers who advocate on behalf of smaller class sizes for our children, the transportation employees who negotiate for the equipment they need to keep the roads clear after a blizzard and the police and firefighters who negotiate for the staffing levels they need to keep us safe,  the New Hampshire AFL-CIO union branch said. Its end goal is to destroy unions. Numbers don t lie, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said. Workers in states with right to work laws have wages that are 12 percent lower. That s because unions raise wages for all workers, not just our members. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said last week that alleged president Donald Trump supports the right-to-work efforts in New Hampshire and other states. The president believes in right to work. He wants to give workers and companies the flexibility to do what s in the best interest for job creators,  Spicer said.Right-to-work legislation has historically failed in New Hampshire but now with a Republican governor and legislature, it might become a reality.Read more:Image: Dave Ingraham via Flickr.",News,6-Feb-17
" This Move By President Obama Completely HUMILIATED Trump, Clearly Shows Who The Better Man Is","The next time any flag waving, faux-patriotic Republican tells you President Obama didn t care about the troops, veterans, or the welfare of the American public, tell them that he donated over $1 million to various charitable causes. Then ask them how braggadocios he was about it.That s right, President Obama, during his time in office, not only saved the country from economic collapse, but used his own money to help his fellow countrymen. According to a Forbes analysis of his tax returns from 2009 to 2015, 54 percent of all donations went to various organizations that help children.However, the biggest recipient of President Obama s generosity was the Fisher House Foundation, which is tasked with supporting the families of veterans. This organization received over $390,000 over the course of Obama s eight years in office. This donation s were given on behalf of the royalties President Obama accumulated from his children s book, Of Thee I Sing.According to Forbes:He gave away $190,000 more to children s causes, including $48,000 to Boys & Girls Clubs. He also gave away $19,500 to the Mosaic Youth Theatre of Detroit. Another $13,500 went to the Christopher House, a Chicago-based group that supports poor working families. Even after he moved to Washington, Obama remained loyal to his Chicago roots. He poured $11,500 into the Midtown Educational Foundation, which offers enrichment programs to poor urban youth in the Windy City, and he gave $20,500 to two groups fighting hunger in Illinois  The $1.1 million of donations Obama declared on his tax returns also do not include the $1.4 million he directed the Nobel Committee to give 10 charities after he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009. The biggest recipient of those funds was, again, the Fisher House Foundation, which got $250,000. Another $200,000 went to the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, and most of the rest went to various scholarship funds.Remember when Republicans made fun of President Obama for being a community organizer and working to make Chicago a better place? Even when busy running the free-world, he never turned his back on where he came from or the people who put him where he is. That s a class act.Perhaps the most telling was how the president doled out his own money in the face of heartbreaking national tragedies. The Forbes analysis shows that President Obama gave $2,000 to a fund for families and victims affected by the Boston bombing in 2013. That same year, he gave $2,000 to the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation. Remember when conservatives mocked him for crying over these tragedies?While president, Obama made over $10 million, with a majority (75 percent) of that coming from book royalties. That means President Obama gave 11 percent of his earnings to charity.Contrast that to Donald Trump   who is worth $4.5 billion. Because Donald Trump refuses to release his taxes, it is not know just how much he gives to charity. According to Forbes:Filings for the Donald J. Trump Foundation reveal that he gave $0 to his own charitable foundation from 2009 to 2014, the most recent year on record. (He donated $2.8 million from 2001 to 2008.) After he stopped giving in 2009, other donors gave $4.4 million to the Trump foundation over the next six years, which Trump in turn doled out to various groups, apparently fooling some recipients into thinking the money came from him.Yeah Donald Trump cares, and Obama is the heartless elitist. Sure. Whatever you say.I would love to see how much Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, Bill O Reilly, Tomi Lahren and the other conservative frauds have given to the troops and their families.Simply put, President Obama was and still is a generous, compassionate, loving human being. He truly loves this country and the people who make it great. The haters are all talk, no action   all while collecting a paycheck while faking support.Read more:Featured image via Darren Hauck/Getty Images",News,6-Feb-17
 California May Stop Paying Taxes To Federal Government After Trump Threatens To Defund The State (DETAILS),"In a recent interview with Fox News, Trump said that California is  out of control  for advancing legislation to provide statewide sanctuary for immigrants and keep law enforcement from cooperating with federal authorities in enforcing Trump s many anti-immigrant measures. Trump told Fox that he will take away every penny that California receives from the federal government.The state of California has one of the ten largest economies in the world. Not only is it a giant among states, competing with the economies of some of the most affluent countries worldwide, but it is one of the few states that pays more into the federal Treasury than it receives in government funding. It would be a huge mistake to put the state of California in a position that legislators may decide to stop paying taxes altogether, but Donald Trump seems determined to do just that because, well, he s an idiot. If we have to, we ll defund,  he said.  We give tremendous amounts of money to California. Thanks to the state s liberal policies, California has outpaced the rest of the nation on job growth and had a gross state product of 2.46 trillion in 2015, placing it sixth behind the United Kingdom in world economies (ranked by Gross Domestic Product) and 11th in the world ranked by cost of living.In other words, California would be fine without the federal money it receives if the state stopped paying taxes to the federal government. Officials are currently looking into doing exactly that if Trump follows through on his threat to take federal funding from the state. California could very well become an organized non-payer,  if Trump follows through on threats to punish cities and states that do not comply with requests to turn over Jews undocumented immigrants to Trump s goons, a former speaker of the state Assembly told KPIX 5 on Sunday.  They could recommend non-compliance with the federal tax code. I don t want to defund the state or city, I don t want to defund anybody, I want to give them the money they need to properly operate a city or a state,  Trump says, but  if they re going to have sanctuary cities we may have to do that   certainly that would be a weapon. Ir would be a weapon, but the federal government needs California s money more than the state needs funding from the government. This fact alone is enough to virtually assure that lawmakers will choose to defund Trump rather than violate their conscience and hand over people Trump has deemed  undesirable. Looks like Trump s threat has been called. It s time to find out if he is really stupid enough to try this kind of stunt.Read more:Featured image via Getty Images (Drew Angerer)",News,6-Feb-17
 WATCH: Senate Dems Hold 24-Hour Debate Marathon As Last Stand Against DeVos Confirmation,"Senate Democrats had one last, huge move planned to stop Betsy DeVos from being confirmed as Education secretary   an all-night debate marathon on the Senate floor. Their ultimate goal? To convince at least one more Republican senator to vote against her and thus stop her confirmation in its tracks.Politico reports that what they referred to as a  Hail Mary  move was already underway as of Monday afternoon, and is scheduled to continue until noon today. As of now, Tuesday s vote is expected to be a 50-50 tie with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote in favor of DeVos. This would be another first, as never before has a tie-breaker been needed for a Cabinet secretary to be confirmed.To be clear, the 24-hour marathon is not a filibuster, which is meant to postpone a vote. The goal here is to sway just one more Republican to cast their vote against DeVos, as this would be enough to keep her from being confirmed.GOP senators have been inundated with tens of thousands of phone calls and emails from constituents begging them not to vote for DeVos, who doesn t have a clue what the hell the Secretary of Education is even supposed to do. (For reference, this is the woman who thinks schools need guns in case of grizzly bear attacks. Insert eye-twitch here.)Democrats have been unanimous in their opposition to DeVos. Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Labor, Education and Pensions Committee, promised that Dems would do  everything we can to persuade just one more Republican to join us, and I strongly encourage people across the country to join us   to double down on your advocacy   and to keep making your voices heard for these last 24 hours. Two Republicans have already broken rank with the GOP on the issue of DeVos  confirmation. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkoswki of Alaska have already announced that they will not support her for Secretary of Education and intend to vote  no  on her confirmation. Other Republicans have let it be known that they are still on the fence. Those opposed to DeVos have been holding rallies in the home states of several lawmakers they are targeting specifically, including Sens. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.).

 WATCH: Trump Literally Accuses The Media Of Covering Up Terrorist Attacks,"Donald Trump has definitely gone off the deep end this time.Whenever a terrorist attack has occurred in this country or overseas, the media has been quick to report on it. From the attacks on 9/11 in New York, to those in Nice and Paris in France and elsewhere, the media has always kept us informed when an attack happens.Donald Trump, however, thinks terrorist attacks are happening every minute of the day and in an effort to scare people and justify his policies, such as his Muslim ban, Trump literally accused the media of covering up terrorist attacks in Europe. All over Europe it s happening,  Trump said during remarks to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) on Monday.  It s gotten to a point where it s not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that. Here s the video via Twitter.Trump says terror so bad  it s not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn t want to report it.  (1/2) pic.twitter.com/PUAIW9ied1  Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 6, 2017This is a complete lie and the American people ought to be totally outraged by the accusation. In no way has the media ever ignored a terrorist attack in Europe. As we have personally witnessed over the last few years, the media has provided extensive coverage of attacks that occurred in Paris, Nice, and Brussels in Europe along with attacks that occurred outside of Europe in Beirut and Ankara.Trump s accusation is irresponsible and plain untrue and he is doing it as a way to gain support for his unconstitutional Muslim ban.Earlier in his remarks, Trump once again spewed delusions about the election, bragging about how the numbers prove that everyone likes him even though he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton. We had a wonderful election, didn t we?  Trump began.  And I saw those numbers   and you like me and I like you. Here s that video via Twitter.Trump begins CENTCOM remarks by saying:  We had a wonderful election, didn t we? And I saw those numbers   and you like me and I like you  pic.twitter.com/Xh8Rqfmyal  Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 6, 2017It s time for the press to start punishing Trump. Media networks should no longer allow Trump surrogates to appear on television because it is clear that they are not telling the truth and are only there to spread misinformation and propaganda.CNN recently refused to have Kellyanne Conway on their programming because she has zero credibility. Every single network should follow their lead.The accusation that the press intentionally covers up terrorist attacks is outrageous and should draw a sharp rebuke and condemnation from media networks all over the world. Donald Trump is literally saying that Europe is plagued by terrorist attacks. It s the same thing as Kellyanne Conway citing a non-existent terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Trump and Conway are making shit up to defend the administration s bigoted agenda and they cannot be allowed to get away with it.Read more:Featured image via screenshot",News,6-Feb-17
 WATCH: General BOMBARDS Trump For The ‘Most Anti-American Statement Ever Made By A President’ (DETAILS),"As you may already know, Trump recently shocked the nation when he went on Fox News and told Bill O Reilly that the United States is just as bad as Russia. He s been roundly denounced for what is impossible to characterize as anything other than an incredibly ignorant, asinine comment   including by his own party.Retired General McCaffrey may have put it better than anyone in a recent interview with NBC s Hallie Jackson, however. You know, Hallie, I m actually incredulous that the president would make a statement like that,  he said,  One can argue that s the most anti-American statement ever made by the President of the United States   to confuse American values with Putin, who s running a criminal oligarchy, who kills people abroad and at home, who imprisons journalists, and takes away business property, who shares it with his former KGB agents, who invades and seizes Crimea and eastern Ukraine   this is an astonishing state of affairs. It s hard to know what to think about it. Here s the video: WATCH: Gen.

 The World Is Laughing At Conservatives For Their Hilariously Misspelled Budweiser Boycott (TWEETS),"Trump supporters became  triggered  after Budweiser s Super Bowl ad that told the story of co-founder Adolphus Busch s journey from Germany to the United States as a legal immigrant.

After all, their idea of a Starbucks  boycott  was to buy lots of coffee and tell the barista their name is  Trump. Budwiser s   erm, Budwiser s   commercial was nothing aside from a history lesson about the company, but the Right s reaction proves that they aren t just concerned with keeping our country safe.

 WATCH: Wounded Vet Tells Trump To Start Acting Like A Legitimate President In POWERFUL Message,"After Donald Trump watches this ad he ll probably start saying that he likes people who weren t wounded in combat.During his presidential campaign, Trump smeared Vietnam veteran John McCain by saying that he likes people who weren t captured by the enemy. McCain is a war hero who was a prisoner of war. He was brutally tortured after being shot down during a mission. As a result, McCain can no longer lift his arms above his shoulders.Ever since the election, Trump has been whining about not being treated like a legitimate president. Of course, that s because Trump lashes out at anyone who criticizes him like a petulant child who isn t getting his way. It s also because Russia helped him win the election and because he has done nothing but hurt people across the nation and all around the world with his policies.For instance, Trump s assault on Obamacare threatens the healthcare of 30 million Americans, including veterans.Well, one veteran had a message for Trump in an amazing ad released on Monday.As a bearded man lifts weights, the camera pulls away to reveal that he only has one leg. He lost the other leg fighting for our country. President Trump, I hear you watch the morning shows,  he began.  Here s what I do every morning. He then tells Trump that if he wants to be considered a legitimate president he should act like one by not killing Obamacare and banning Muslims from entering the nation. Look, you lost the popular vote. You re having trouble drawing a crowd. And your approval rating keeps sinking. But kicking thousands of my fellow veterans off the health insurance by killing the Affordable Care Act and banning Muslims won t help. That s not the America I sacrificed myself for. You wanna be a legitimate president, sir? Then act like one. Here s the video via Twitter.New TV ad running today: Wounded veteran tells Trump:  You wanna be a legitimate president, sir? Then act like one. pic.twitter.com/GiL5X62Dx5  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 6, 2017Donald Trump will never be legitimate. Because he is totally incapable of acting presidential. He is a selfish bully who only cares about himself and his rich friends. It s only been a little over two weeks since he took over the White House and he is already destroying the very foundation of this country while alienating our allies. His decisions are ruining lives. And he has even gotten a Navy SEAL killed in response to a video that is several years old, proving that he is completely inept. At some point, the military will have to refuse to follow Trump s orders, especially if he continues to escalate confrontations with Iran and China. This country cannot afford to lose more blood and treasure because a madman is obsessed with absolute power.Read more:Featured image via screenshot",News,6-Feb-17
 Kellyanne Lied When She Said She Said She ‘Misspoke’ About Bowling Green Massacre; Here’s Proof,"Among the never ending stream of Trump administration lies, one in particular has captured the attention of Twitter. Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway pretty much lost all her credibility when she claimed, in an interview with Chris Matthews, that there was a Bowling Green massacre which was somehow the fault of President Obama. There wasn t. I bet it s brand-new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized, and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. Entire twitter feeds sprung up over Conway s made up massacre. Conway s defense was that she misspoke and that the media is just being mean to her..@KellyannePolls:  I misspoke one word. The corrections in the newspapers who are attacking me are 3 paragraphs long every day.  pic.twitter.com/lA0wLk1my8  Fox News (@FoxNews) February 5, 2017Except, this isn t the first time she talked about the Bowling Green massacre and she had even elaborated on it in an interview with, of all sources, Cosmopolitan.(I)n an interview with Cosmopolitan.com conducted by phone days earlier, on Sunday, Jan. 29, Conway used the same phrasing, claiming that President Barack Obama called for a temporary  ban on Iraqi refugees  after the  Bowling Green massacre.  (The quotes did not appear in either of two stories recently published on Cosmopolitan.com.) He did, it s a fact,  she said of Obama.  Why did he do that? He did that for exactly the same reasons. He did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills, and come back here, and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers  lives away. In other words, Cosmo did the job that Chris Matthews failed to do.What Conway was referring to is the fact that there were two Iraqi men, Mohanad Shareef Hammadi and Waad Ramadan Alwan, who were refugees and did become radicalized (in the United States, not in Iraq), but were arrested before carrying anything out.While Conway tried to tie the massacre that wasn t to Obama s non-existent travel ban, the facts show that Obama handled the situation very well. They administered a toughing vetting process for Iraqi refugees for six months. There was no ban, and as Cosmo has shown, there was no misstatement on Conway s part.Read more:Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,6-Feb-17
 CNN HAMMERS Kellyanne Conway For Lying About Them As Network Considers Permanent Ban,"Kellyanne Conway just got hammered with facts by CNN after she lied about why she wasn t on the network s Sunday shows.First, CNN rejected Kellyanne Conway for a day. Now the network is considering a permanent ban.The war between Donald Trump and CNN has escalated ever since inauguration day. Trump has repeatedly called CNN  fake news  and his adviser Kellyanne Conway has only parroted this attack every time she appears on any media outlet to whine about the way networks are reporting on the administration.It got to the point where Trump even froze CNN out by declaring that he would not send any more surrogates to appear on CNN shows. So when Trump offered to put Conway on CNN on Sunday, the network declined and got Mike Pence instead.Conway has repeatedly spread falsehoods and lies in defense of Trump and has attacked the media coverage every time she makes an appearance on television. She even admitted that Trump and his team lies by referring to those lies as  alternative facts,  a phrase she has been taking a lot of heat for since she uttered it.And her recent false story about a terrorist attack against Bowling Green, Kentucky that never happened has also earned her criticism from journalists. And that s why CNN booted her from their shows on Sunday.According to the New York Times,Some, like the New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen, were calling upon the television networks to stop booking her. And CNN declined to have her as a guest on Sunday   in part because the Trump administration offered her in lieu of Vice President Mike Pence, but also because of what the network told me were  serious questions about her credibility. So now CNN could be the first network to ban Kellyanne Conway from the airwaves. And that s a good thing because if she is incapable of doing anything but lying and spreading false information, she definitely should not be given a platform to mislead people. On any network for that matter.And their decision to ban her might pretty quickly since Conway just outright lied about why she wasn t on CNN on Sunday.Conway claimed that she wasn t rejected by CNN and that she wasn t on the shows because she had family commitments. She then proceeded to claim that she is scheduled to appear on CNN on Monday and Tuesday.CNN quickly responded.. @KellyannePolls was offered to SOTU on Sunday by the White House. We passed. Those are the facts.  CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 6, 2017Other media outlets should follow CNN s lead. Journalistic integrity and ethics demand that Conway be removed before she does more damage. Her misinformation and propaganda campaign may be tolerated by Fox, but it should not be tolerated by real news outlets.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,6-Feb-17
 Sean Spicer Whines That SNL Was ‘Mean’ To Him And Demands They Mock Him Less,"Just like Donald Trump, White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer can t handle being satirized on Saturday Night Live.Melissa McCarthy delivered a devastatingly brilliant performance as Spicer, who has embarrassed himself himself repeatedly during press briefings by attacking the media for accurately covering Trump and his administration.Most infamously, Spicer was sent out to lecture and shame the press the day after the inauguration about the accurate assessment of Trump s crowd size on inauguration day. Spicer claimed that the crowd at Trump s ceremony was the largest in history and people around the world laughed because all the evidence shows that Trump s crowd size was clearly one of the smallest.Spicer has also feuded with CNN during the briefings.McCarthy did a fantastic job portraying Spicer during a press briefing.Here s the video via YouTube.Well, Spicer was at the Super Bowl in Houston on Sunday and he was asked about the skit.And let s just say that Spicer is a snowflake who thinks Saturday Night Live is being  mean. According to Extra,Explaining that he d first heard about the sketch while leaving church Sunday morning, Spicer said his texts had been blowing up so much he thought there must be a national emergency.Spicer told  Extra  exclusively he felt the impression was a little exaggerated. His advice was that McCarthy  needs to slow down on the gum chewing; way too many pieces in there.  Though he thought it was a really  funny  show, he felt that McCarthy  could dial back  a bit.Last night, Alec Baldwin was back as President Trump as well. As for what he thought of Alec s portrayal of the President, Spicer had the same feelings as the Leader of the Free World, calling it  mean.  Spicer said,  Alec has gone from funny to mean, and that s unfortunate.  SNL  used to be really funny. There s a streak of meanness now that they ve crossed over to mean. Seriously, Trump and his team need to grow a thicker skin if they hope to make it through the next four years without ending up with high blood pressure.Spicer apparently doesn t realize that a little exaggeration mixed with truth is what makes great satire work. As for his claim that Saturday Night Live is  mean,  I don t remember Spicer ever complaining about SNL making fun of President Obama. In fact, I don t recall him ever complaining about the many truly awful things Republicans said about President Obama over the last eight years in real life.Saturday Night Live is a comedy show. If Trump and Spicer can t handle being mocked, they should both resign because if they can t deal with comedians how are they going to handle it when world leaders criticize them? Judging by their reaction to SNL, not very well.Featured image via screenshot",News,6-Feb-17
 WHOA: Steve Bannon Tricked Trump Into Handing Him An INSANE Amount Of Power,"Last week, news broke that white supremacist and former Breitbart head Stever Bannon had been given a seat on the  principals committee    a role usually reserved for generals   while the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence had been  downgraded  and they were told to only attend meetings when issues in their direct area of expertise are being considered.But why would Trump choose to place this much power in the hands of Steve Bannon? It turns out it wasn t a choice. The New York Times reports that Trump is signing executive orders without bothering to find out what is in them, and that it was not until after he had signed it that Trump realized one of his numerous executive orders had made Bannon one of the most powerful men in the country:Mr. Priebus bristles at the perception that he occupies a diminished perch in the West Wing pecking order compared with previous chiefs. But for the moment, Mr. Bannon remains the president s dominant adviser, despite Mr. Trump s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council, a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban.Yes, you read that correctly: our President cares so little about doing his job properly that he doesn t even bother to find out the details of the executive orders he is signing   even if he is granting an insane amount of power to someone who should not be taken seriously when offering his opinion on ice cream flavors.Bannon s influence has steadily grown as Trump s time in office has passed, to the point that it is not unreasonable to call him   not Trump    President.  While this is a popular turn of events among white supremacists, a group that was courted heavily by Bannon s propaganda outlet, the rest of the country is steadily growing weary of dealing with someone like Bannon   who has described himself as a  Leninist  who wants to  destroy the state    having any power at all.Featured image via screengrab",News,6-Feb-17
 WATCH: Joe Scarborough Fears Trump Will Murder Journalists And Political Rivals Like Putin Does,"Donald Trump s admiration of Vladimir Putin and the tyrannical way he runs Russia is very worrying to Trump s friend Joe Scarborough.The Morning Joe host strongly advised that Trump to put out a statement condemning the killing of journalists and political opponents. Because if he doesn t, his recent statements in two separate interviews over the course of the last year are even scarier. He s running his country, and at least he s a leader,  Trump said in December 2015 when asked about Putin murdering journalists and political rivals.  Unlike what we have in this country. But again: He kills journalists that don t agree with him,  Scarborough replied.Trump then stunned Scarborough by excusing Putin s crimes. I think our country does plenty of killing, also, Joe, so, you know. There s a lot of stupidity going on in the world right now, Joe. A lot of killing going on. A lot of stupidity. And that s the way it is. And just as in that interview, Trump basically repeated himself during an interview with Bill O Reilly that aired prior to the Super Bowl on Sunday. There are a lot of killers,  Trump said in defense of Putin.  You think our country s so innocent? And that makes Joe Scarborough wonder if Trump will start emulating Putin. If Donald Trump keeps being asked to criticize Vladimir Putin for assassinating journalists, and Donald Trump refuses to criticize Vladimir Putin for assassinating journalists, and say, well, we do it, too, in a sense, does that suggest that he thinks that it s OK to assassinate journalists? Does that suggest that it s OK to jail political opponents, to assassinate political opponents? Scarborough then condemned Trump for defending Putin and advised him to issue a statement against killing journalists and political rivals to make it clear that he does not support doing these things. If you don t condemn after being asked repeatedly to condemn these actions, at some point you go back to the  he who does not deny admits  story, and it suggests that he does. I suggest somebody at the White House get him to write a very strong statement letting the world know that he condemns the assassination of journalists and political rivals, because he suggests in the two interviews with O Reilly and us that he does not How do you compare a country whose leader assassinates journalists, a country s leader who assassinates political rivals   we saw one found dead in the street across from the Kremlin a year ago   who jails economic rivals, who has an authoritarian regime that has put everybody on notice, he s plundered his country. Many people estimate that Putin is worth $200 billion that he has stolen from the Russian people, and yet this desire to keep preaching moral equivalency continues and it is baffling. It was disturbing enough a year ago, it is baffling now, as president of the United States, that he s still doing this. Here s the video via MSNBC.Donald Trump is a threat to our individual liberties and our lives. His obsession with wanting to be buddies with Putin is frightening and the fact that he is actually defending murder is sickening and un-American.Featured image via screenshot",News,6-Feb-17
 Trump Claims ‘Any Negative Polls’ Are ‘FAKE NEWS’ And Gets SAVAGED By The Internet (TWEETS),"Donald Trump kicked off his Monday morning by tweeting something so stupid that it was necessary to check multiple times if it was a parody account. Apparently, The Emperor has been told he is wearing the finest of clothing for so long that he is completely unaware he stands naked (in the figurative, not the  claw your eyes out to make the awful visage disappear manner) and looking pretty stupid before us.According to The Donald, any and all negative polls are  fake news  and don t at all reflect the actual feelings of the millions of people who are protesting him in the streets and the millions more who are gathering to denounce him online.  Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting,  Trump says.Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017Trump, of course, is referencing his Muslim ban, which stopped people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering our country (including a baby who needed heart surgery, for a time). The ban was met by widespread condemnation before a judge ultimately shut it down   at least for now. Contrary to The Donald s assertion, most Americans actually oppose the ban. Politico reports:Fifty-three percent opposed the order, according to a CNN/ORC poll, with 46 percent arguing that it makes the U.S. less safe from terrorism and 49 percent saying it harms American values by preventing those seeking asylum from entering the U.S.Fifty-one percent expressed disapproval with the ban in a CBS News survey, in which 57 percent of respondents said the ban goes against the country s founding principles. I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it,  Trump, who posted a completely fake story on his timeline to support the ban and whose propaganda minister completely invented a massacre in an effort to sway public opinion in The Donald s direction.  Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies! I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017Trump does indeed call his own shots (the ones President Steve Bannon doesn t call for him, anyway), but none of them are based in reality. Thanks to his cozy relationship with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, who helped Trump win the election through an aggressive propaganda campaign and hacks of his political opponents (something Trump specifically requested during his campaign) and the numerous horrific actions he has taken since assuming office, Trump has managed to become the most hated President in history  and Americans happily let him know it daily.Lol fake news, fake judge, fake voting, right, @realDonaldTrump? pic.twitter.com/DHuz5z1CrM  David G.

 Jordanian Airline Tells Trump To F*ck Himself With Discount Airfare To New York (TWEETS),"The Royal Jordanian airline is celebrating Donald Trump s recent humiliation in style. Since a federal judge recently lifted The Donald s travel ban, Royal Jordanian wants to make sure as many people visit the United States as possible. Royal Jordanian received new instructions from the US Customs and Border Protection to temporarily halt ban on travel of seven previously-barred nationals to enter the USA. The countries are: Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran and Somalia,  the airline said on its website, noting that as always, travelers need a valid visa or Green Card.To celebrate Trump s despair, Royal Jordanian is slashing prices while the ban is lifted. On Sunday, they tweeted an ad featuring the word  Ban  with the  a  converted to an  o  and the word  Voyage  written in.  Fly to the US with RJ now that you re allowed to,  it reads, with heavily slashed prices to Chicago, Detroit, and Trump s home state of New York.  ??   #DonaldTrump #MuslimBan pic.twitter.com/rptY3dS3Xh  Royal Jordanian (@RoyalJordanian) February 5, 2017This isn t the first time RJ has hit Trump over the ban. On Election Day, the airline encouraged travelers to  travel to the US while you re still allowed to    you know,  just in case he wins. ?   #USElections pic.twitter.com/yBDVO2w3gb  Royal Jordanian (@RoyalJordanian) November 8, 2016The lift of  so-called President  Trump s ban by a  so-called judge  has sent the Orange Menace into a fanatical rage as of late with Trump lashing out on Twitter, blaming the judge who denied him his success in keeping people who practice a religion he hates out of the country for any an all terrorist attacks that might or might not occur in the future.Trump should be thanking Judge Robert. As President, it is in his best interest to learn as much about our government as possible   and it s clear that The Donald has never heard of  checks and balances  before this.If you live in one of the seven previously-banned countries, be sure to fly to New York at a discount and visit Trump Tower.

 Trump Insists His Muslim Ban Has Been ‘Going Smoothly’ (VIDEO),"Even though alleged president Donald Trump s executive order banning seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. has caused widespread panic, he told Fox News host Bill O Reilly on Sunday that the move was going  smoothly.  Trump s fake news  facts failed to mention that his poorly worded order sent the world into chaos.When O Reilly asked the man-baby POTUS how the travel ban worked out following the executive order, Trump said,  I think it was very smooth. You had 109 people out of hundreds of thousands of travelers and all we did was vet those people very, very carefully. Actually, that s not true and we re sure you re shocked. 60,000 visas were revoked following his Muslim ban.Press Secretary Sean Spicer also echoed Trump s claims previously that only 109 people were affected by his travel ban on the seven Muslim countries even though that claim was disproved.Facts matter:While DHS estimates suggest that around 375 travelers who were in transit were stranded or detained, thousands of refugees were put into limbo when Trump scuttled the U.S. refugee program.During the jaw-dropping interview in which even a Fox News host challenged him, Trump insisted multiple times that the executive order was implemented in a  smooth  fashion and only 109 people were affected.In that same interview, Trump was asked by the Fox News host why he respects Vladimir Putin. O Reilly said,  He s a killer  and the host was not lying. Still yet, Trump said,  There are a lot of killers. You think our country s so innocent? Watch:President Trump Bannon also said he s against sanctuary cities.From there, Trump went into the same dangerous territory his team keeps venturing into. He wants to prove he won the popular vote, but he s doing so without proof. O Reilly told him he needs data to back him up his claim that 3 million people voted for in the 2016 U.S. presidential election illegally, Trump insisted that Mike Pence will set up a commission to investigate the widespread voter fraud which has already been debunked.Image via screen capture.

 Ivanka Trump’s Brand Gives HILARIOUS Excuse For Plummeting Sales As Yet Another Retailer Drops It,"More than one major retail chain has decided to drop Ivanka Trump s fashion line, and while they don t cite specific politics in their reasons for doing so, many believe that falling sales were prompted by politics, which, in turn, prompted the chains to drop her. The brand, though, had yet to issue a statement on this until recently.It s just slightly ridiculous: The Ivanka Trump brand continues to expand across categories and distribution with increased customer support, leading us to experience significant year-over-year revenue growth in 2016. We believe that the strength of a brand is measured not only by the profits it generates, but the integrity it maintains. Integrity?  Really? In any case, a company can t survive on integrity alone. If enough stores dump her brand, her fashion line goes under. End of.But that wasn t all they said. They also used the statement to play up the diversity of the company and the professionalism of the women behind it: The women behind the brand represent a diverse group of professionals and we are proud to say that the Ivanka Trump brand continues to embody the principles upon which it was founded. It is a company built to inspire women with solution-oriented offerings, created to celebrate and service the many aspects of their lives. That doesn t really address the brand getting dumped by high-end retailers like Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus. And it also doesn t address what the company is doing to mitigate this, even if they never specifically say they re working to mitigate it. Where are they going with the brand? Are they in talks with anyone else that could replace Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus?The statement is reminiscent of Trump s spokespeople, and also could be suggesting that they have no idea what they re going to do if more chains drop them.Featured image by Aaron P.

 Hamilton Cast Added ‘Sisterhood’ To ‘America The Beautiful’ And Conservatives Are Losing Their MINDS (TWEETS),"The Super Bowl had not yet begun and Trump fans were already throwing a tantrum   not over something Lady Gaga did, but because of what is normally one of their favorite songs: America the Beautiful.The song was performed by three members of the cast of Hamilton, Phillipa Soo, Ren e Elise Goldsberry and Jasmine Cephas Jones, and it was just as excellent as one would expect. But there was a problem   at least, there was a problem according to the Stupid Part of America. When the trip reached the line  And crown thy good with brotherhood,  two of the women added  and sisterhood. Now to most people, recognizing that women are people and Americans is not a huge deal. The move was largely celebrated on social media as an attempt to stand up to Republicans  bullying of women and repeated attempts to deprive them of healthcare and control their bodies. But it was for that very reason that Trump fans went nuts on Twitter following the song. WHAT THE FUCK INSTEAD OF  AND SOUND THY GOOD WITH BROTHERHOOD  THE LIBERAL SUPER BOWL SINGERS SAID  BROTHERHOOD AND SISTERHOOD  IM SO DONE,  one enraged conservative who apparently doesn t even know the original lyrics writes. Another complains that the women changed the words for their  polical correctness agenda. No, it s just brotherhood. Not sisterhood. Stupid cunts. You don t remix the shit.

 WATCH: Keith Olbermann FLAYS Trump For Helping Our Enemies,"Keith Olbermann doesn t mince words, and when it comes to Donald Trump, he doesn t just avoid mincing words, he lights into him. Trump and his minions keep saying that the Muslim ban is necessary to protect us from terrorism. A lawyer from the Department of Justice even made that claim in court and got promptly smacked down by the judge. Olbermann took to his show,  The Resistance,  to flay Trump open again over the effects of his racist ban.First off, Olbermann says that Trump is aiding our enemies with the ban, and indeed, he is: The first, perhaps the only international organization of any kind to congratulate Trump on his Muslim ban in sheep s clothing was so-called Islamic State. ISIS. The terrorists. It sent him no bouquets, it issued no press releases, it did not have to. It has been celebrating him and this plan, which will almost certainly instigate the deaths of American citizens since the night of the election. Trump is alienating Muslims, making people in America fear Muslims, and that makes Muslim-Americans ripe for radicalization. It also pisses off Muslims elsewhere and makes them ripe for radicalization. But Olbermann postulates that this might be what Trump wants: Since [the Muslim ban] is the greatest possible gift to ISIS for recruitment, for confirmation, for rationalization, for instigating terrorist acts, maybe here in America, it must either be that Trump does not understand what will almost inevitably follow, or that he does understand what will almost inevitably follow. Why would an American want that? Not an American president, why would any American deliberately do anything to give terrorists a rationalization to commit terrorism in America? Well, Olbermann says if we look back to the Bush administration following Sept. 11, they used that as an excuse to attack Iraq, as well as to roll back privacy laws and other freedoms in the name of keeping  the homeland  safe. Sowing fear to justify all of that, of course, was how Republicans kept their hold on the White House in 2004.After explaining all that, Olbermann paints a possible, and terrifying, motive for Trump instigating terrorist attacks. Watch the whole episode below:Blaming a judge for a hypothetical terror attack, when he is doing the recruiting work for ISIS.

 Coke Just Stuck It To Trump’s Bigotry With The Most BRILLIANT Super Bowl Ad EVER (VIDEO),"The whole nation is ashamed of the open and overt exclusion and bigotry shown by Donald Trump, his administration, and his supporters. This sentiment was ratcheted up a thousand fold when Trump signed a hateful immigration order   the promised Muslim ban thinly cloaked in false claims about national security concerns   that threw the nation and world into chaos, tore families apart, and put many lives at risk.Well, the Super Bowl is perhaps the most watched program of the year, and it is the perfect time to show people what one thinks, via those famous commercials. Coke decided to do just that, and it was nothing short of brilliant.The popular soft drink company aired an ad at the beginning of Sunday s game where  America the Beautiful  was being sang in different languages, showing the beautiful diversity of America in the many faces of our country. Every race, color, creed, national origin, religion   everything you could think of   is represented in this amazing commercial.Donald Trump might want to white wash America, with the help of the likes of white supremacists like Steve Bannon, but he cannot kill our inclusive spirit.Well done, Coke!

 Judge Who Blocked Trump’s Muslim Ban REPEATEDLY Dropped The Mic On DOJ Lawyer Trying To Defend It,"While Trump is whining up a storm on Twitter about how Judge James Robart has made it so anyone can get into the U.S. by halting his Muslim ban, there s a conversation between Robart and Dept. of Justice attorney Michelle Bennett floating around that explains a lot about how Robart sees it.Robart asked Bennett the following pointed question, which everyone with any sense has been asking since Trump threw the world into chaos last week: How many arrests have there been of foreign nationals from those seven countries since 9/11? Bennett replied: Your Honor, I don t have that information. I m from the civil division if that helps get me off the hook. What a thing for a lawyer to say   it almost sounds like Bennett felt a little silly defending Trump s Muslim ban in court. She may have felt even sillier after Robart said: Let me tell you. The answer to that is none, as best I can tell. So, I mean, you re here arguing on behalf of someone that says: We have to protect the United States from these individuals coming from these countries, and there s no support for that. Bennett argued that the rationale behind the order was to protect the U.S. from potential terrorists. Many people think that makes some sense, but neither Trump nor his administration ever weighed that against the possible impact of such a ban. Had any terrorists actually come from any of those countries, and attacked us, then the ban might have some merit.As it stands, though, it exempts countries that actually do have a history of exporting terrorism.Robart responded to Bennett s statement about protecting the U.S. with this: I m also asked to look and determine if the executive order is rationally based. And rationally based, to some extent, means I have to find it grounded in fact instead of fiction. The Muslim ban is currently based on the fiction that these countries pose a clear and present threat. They don t. The  threat  that Trump sees is vague and rooted in paranoia, not fact. Yet Trump is all over Twitter claiming that now  bad people  can just indiscriminately pour into the country as though U.S. Customs and Border Protection was only able to do its job with the ban in effect.He claims to have instructed DHS to very carefully look at people coming into the country, because DHS and CBP apparently weren t doing that. Chances are he did no such thing, or he made them roll their eyes. He ll take credit if nothing happens, and he ll blame Robart if something does.While the Trump administration is certain that they ll win this case and the ban will be reinstated, others aren t so sure. Some think this will go all the way to the Supreme Court, and if it has to, it has to. The harm the ban causes actually outweighs the dangers of not having it in place.Below is a video of the Feb. 3 hearing, and the relevant portion begins at the 38:00 mark:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,5-Feb-17
 Kuwait Catches Trump In MAJOR Lie But He Refuses To Back Down,"Since Donald Trump enacted the travel ban from seven majority Muslim countries last week, he s spent most of his time on the defensive. That position got worse after Trump posted a fake news story on his Facebook timeline that was quickly debunked by the country of Kuwait, but not before the right-wing media ran with it as proof that Trump s Muslim ban is cool, even in the Muslim world.The article, which is still on Trump s Facebook page, said that Kuwait enacted a similar ban to Trump s.Syrians, Iraqis, Iranians, Pakistanis and Afghans will not be able to obtain visit, tourism or trade Kuwaiti visas with the news coming one day after the US slapped its own restrictions on seven Muslim-majority countries.Passport holders from the countries will not be allowed to enter the Gulf state while the blanket ban is in place and have been told not to apply to visas.Trump s post has more than 250,000 likes and nearly 70,000 shares. It was also shared by right-wing sites like Breitbart and Infowars. The only problem is, it didn t happen.The foreign ministry of the Middle Eastern country  categorically denies these claims and affirms that these reported nationalities   have big communities in Kuwait and enjoy full rights,  according to a Sunday morning report in Reuters.The story shared by Trump had alleged that  Syrians, Iraqis, Iranians, Pakistanis and Afghans will not be able to obtain visit, tourism or trade Kuwaiti visas with the news coming one day after the US slapped its own restrictions on seven Muslim-majority countries.  The story in the Jordanian news outlet Al Bawaba did not have an official statement or order from the Kuwaiti government nor from any of the countries it said were facing a ban.Source: The Daily BeastOf course, Trump hasn t taken the story down, which shouldn t be a surprise at all. The Trump administration is apparently far more comfortable with lies than they are the truth. If they told the truth, they d lose the support of the majority of their followers.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images.",News,5-Feb-17

 Chrissy Teigan Shoving Trump’s Words Back In His Face Is The Best Thing You’ll See Today (TWEET),"If you haven t noticed by now, some people have some very strong opinions about Donald Trump. So much so, that when Uber CEO Travis Kalanick felt the pressure of thousands and thousands dropping their Uber accounts because of his association with Trump, he backed out the Trump s business advisory council.Then, after Trump insisted on banning Muslims from this country because apparently he believes all Muslims are evil, people rose up all across the country. And then when his ban was shot down by a federal judge and denied a stay, it just went to prove that all those opposed to Trump are absolutely correct.Trump didn t take ANY of this rejection very well. In fact, he keeps going to his Twitter to tell us how  evil  people are pouring into the country (they re not), and went so far as to angry tweet this:We must keep ""evil"" out of our country!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017And seeing as most people see Trump as evil, most people responded to this by asking him to leave if he truly feels that way.However, there was one response that was simply the best.

 Fact: Repealing Obamacare Will Absolutely Decimate Red State America,"We hear a lot from Republicans about how they re going to repeal the  job killing,   healthcare killing,  big government law unofficially called Obamacare. These unsung heroes of the nation, almost all of them representing red state America, are going to free us and their states from the shackles of socialized medicine   or so they say.Should Republicans get their way, they will absolutely decimate their states  economies.According to the Economic Policy Institute, an American think tank in Washington, D.C.:Across the country, 29.8 million people would lose their health insurance if the Affordable Care Act were repealed more than doubling the number of people without health insurance. And 1.2 million jobs would be lost not just in health care but across the board.So not only will America overall be taken back to the dark ages of pre-Obamacare, red states will be hit the hardest. In terms of the increase in the uninsured rate per state, of the top 30 that will be hit hardest, 20 are red states that voted for Donald Trump.So how much will the uninsured rate increase with an Obamacare repeal? Here s the list (top 20) for Trump states:The blue states that would be most affected by the repeal would be Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Illinois, Oregon, and Washington.If Republicans think their town hall events are bad now, just wait until they see what the summer of 2017 will produce. Democrats got the brunt of it in 2011, now it s time for the GOP to reap what they ve sown.Leaked audio from the Republican retreat in Philadelphia showed that many GOPers were divided on whether to repeal or reform Obamacare. Many expressed concern with how their constituents would react if a full repeal were put in place. At the retreat, one Republican, Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, yelled: We re telling those people that we re not going to pull the rug out from under them, and if we do this too fast, we are in fact going to pull the rug out from under them. Rep. Virginia Foxx chastised MacArthur and other weary Republicans as  weak-kneed. Rep. MacArthur is correct in his fears: If Obamacare is repealed, and people lose their health insurance, Republicans are going to be cast as the enemy for pulling the rug out. And as the Economic Policy Institute showed, there are a lot of red-state Americans who will be affected.Given Trump s immense unpopularity, an Obamacare repeal would almost certainly hand the Democrats a House and Senate majority in 2018.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,5-Feb-17
 Dianne Feinstein: Trump Is ‘Splitting’ The United States Apart,"Senator Dianne Feinstein went on Fox News this Sunday and ripped President Trump a new one.Pointing out the rank hypocrisy over Trump s executive actions and how Republicans treated President Obama, Feinstein called on the president to unite the country. Instead of uniting, Feinstein said, he s splitting it apart even more:You ve got people in the streets here. This president has not brought this nation together. He says he s working for his base. Well, there are a majority of people who are outside of that base. My best advice has been, and I was able to say this to him directly,  Please Mr. President, you have to bring this country together.  What he s doing is splitting it apart.Currently, the majority of the United States has an unfavorable view of Trump, who set a record for quickest descent into net negative approval ratings over 50 percent. In contrast, it took President Obama almost 1,000 days to reach that point. Trump did it in eight.Feinstein also blasted Trump for his immigration ban, telling Chris Wallace that he is  not a dictator  and that the Supreme Court will ultimately decide if his executive action is unconstitutional.Similarly, the majority of Americans are sharply disapproving of his immigration executive order, and his handling of terrorism, national security, and immigrant, all key tenets to his 2016 campaign.The most shocking statistic comes from Public Policy Polling, which found 40 percent of the American public wants to impeach President Trump. That number is up 5 points from a similar question asked just a week ago. In comparison, it took 16 months after Watergate for the American public to reach that number in support of Nixon s resignation. Trump s done it in two weeks.Not surprisingly, 88-92 percent of Republicans support of the job President Trump is doing. Only 7-10 percent of Democrats believe so. And every major poll has shown independent voters to be sharply divided, with all polls tilting negative.Senator Feinstein is right: President Trump is splitting this country apart all to appease the small minority who voted for him. All his promises of being the president who bridges the two Americas has completely fallen flat.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,5-Feb-17
 WATCH: Bernie Sanders SCORCHES Trump For Abandoning Working Class To Help Wall Street,"Donald Trump supporters who struggle to earn a paycheck continue to get screwed over and Bernie Sanders called Trump out for it on Sunday.On Friday, Trump met with Wall Street bankers and promised that he will gut Dodd-Frank regulations that prevent them from screwing over their customers. Specifically, Trump admitted that he is only interested in helping his rich friends instead of sticking to his promise to help the working class Americans who voted for him. We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank, because frankly I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses and they can t borrow money. They just can t get any money because the banks just won t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank. So we ll be talking about that in terms of the banking industry. Furthermore, Trump has stacked his administration with former Goldman Sachs employees despite criticizing Hillary Clinton throughout his campaign for her ties to the big Wall Street bank.On Sunday, Senator Bernie Sanders did not mince words as he called out Trump for being a fraud. It is hard not to laugh to see President Trump alongside these Wall Street guys,  Sanders said on CNN with Jake Tapper.  I have to say this, Jake, and I don t mean to be disrespectful. This guy is a fraud. Sander s reminded Tapper and viewers that Trump ran his campaign by promising to fight Wall Street. This guy ran for president of the United States and said,  I, Donald Trump, I m going to take on Wall Street, these guys are getting away with murder.  And then suddenly he appoints all these Wall Street billionaires, his major financial adviser comes from Goldman Sachs and now he s going to dismantle legislation that protects consumers. Indeed, Trump claimed during his campaign that he would be tough on Wall Street and would seek to restore laws that were passed after the Great Depression, like Glass-Steagall, that placed regulations on the financial sector designed to prevent the kind of banking practices that caused it in the first place and would also cause the Great Recession in 2008.Sanders also slammed Trump for appointing people who want to destroy Medicare and Social Security despite promising that he would protect both programs. This is a guy who ran for president, saying,  I m not going to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,  Sanders said.  And then he appoints all of these guys who are precisely going to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. In the end, while Sanders conceded that Trump put on a good show to dupe voters,  I think he s going to sell out the middle class and the working class of this country. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump does not care about the American people. He only cares about himself and his wealthy buddies. He s a hypocrite for palling around with Goldman Sachs executives and is a liar for making promises to his middle class supporters that he clearly had absolutely no intention of keeping. How many times do his supporters need to get duped before they turn against him?Featured image via Flickr/Flickr",News,5-Feb-17
 WATCH: Trump Literally Promises To Gut Financial Regulations So His Friends Can Screw The Economy,"Donald Trump was blunt when he explained why he wants to gut financial regulations. So his friends can destroy the economy and get richer from doing so.In 2009, President Obama and Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in response to the Great Recession caused by the big banks and Republican economic policies.The recession nearly collapsed the world economy because Republicans have repealed financial regulations that were put in place after the Great Depression of the 1930s to prevent such economic crises from occurring.The law prevents banks from approving loans for those who are unable to pay them back and puts restrictions on the activities of big banks so that they don t repeat the bullshit they did to get our country into such economic messes in the first place.MSN reports that Trump signed an executive order that  will effectively halt an Obama-era Labor Department rule that requires brokers to act in a client s best interest, rather than seek the highest profits for themselves, when providing retirement advice. In short, it will allow big banks to swindle people and screw Americans over in the name of profit, a practice that hurt millions of Americans during the recession.But Trump wants to keep attacking Dodd-Frank anyway because he wants to help his rich buddies. We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank because frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine that had nice businesses, they can t borrow money,  Trump said on Friday while during a meeting with Wall Street tycoons like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan-Chase.  They just can t get any money because the banks just won t let them borrow it because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank. Here s the video via YouTube:Again, if a bank is not letting you borrow money, it s because they have determined that you are too much of a risk.Just ask Donald Trump. He has so much trouble getting loans from banks here in the United States that he has to get loans from Deutche Bank in Germany, which has repeatedly violated Dodd-Frank regulations.Trump has repeatedly failed to pay contractors for work he has hired them to perform and his many failed business ventures over the years such as Trump Steaks and Trump Airlines has understandable caused many banks to see Trump as a risk. So if his friends are unable to get loans, it s probably because they they don t run  nice businesses  like Trump claims.When a bank loans money to people, they are risking their capital and if a person like Trump and his friends fail to pay that loan back, it doesn t just hurt the bank, it hurts customers of the bank. One bad loan could result in the bank having to shut down or pass the expense of the loss to customers to cover it.It s a shitty deal for banks and a shitty deal for people who trust their banks to protect their money.Donald Trump isn t doing what is best for the American people by attacking Dodd-Frank. He is doing favors for his wealthy friends and that is going to harm our economy and set the stage for another economic collapse that could be even worse than one President Obama helped our country recover from over the last eight years.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,5-Feb-17
 Even Mitch McConnell Is Beginning To Turn On Trump; Is Impeachment Next? (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s Muslim ban is proving to be a lot more difficult and a lot less constitutional than his followers hope. While two courts in a row have struck Trump down, even Mitch McConnell is seeing the writing on the wall. He said on Sunday that the Senate will not defend Trump s questionably constitutional Muslim ban.On CNN s State of the Union, McConnell was asked about a couple of Trump s latest, including Trump s defense of Russian President Vladimir Putin s record of assassinating his political enemies, to which Trump essentially shrugged his shoulders and said that the United States does it too. McConnell called Putin  a thug  and then, without a shred of irony in his voice, complained that Putin wasn t legitimately elected.The subject then turned to Trump s claim that he only lost the popular vote because more than 3 million undocumented people voted. While McConnell didn t exactly deny this baseless claim, he did say that  election fraud  wasn t significant enough to have swayed the election and that any investigations should be left up to the state.Then it turned to Trump s latest priority, which is his Muslim ban. While Trump hasn t yet lashed out at the second court to put a halt to his ban, Trump did have a Twitter meltdown toward the first, who is a conservative George Bush Sr. appointee:The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017CNN s Jake Tapper asked McConnell if Congress would be willing to make the ban law, which would make the legality at least a bit less questionable. McConnell wanted nothing to do with it. I don t know that that s necessary,  McConnell told CNN s Jake Tapper on  State of the Union  Sunday.  I mean, the courts are going to decide whether the executive order the President issued is valid or not, and we all follow court orders. Here s the video in its entirety:McConnell is sending a clear message to Donald Trump and it s one he won t like. Even in our hyper partisan Congress, McConnell is not willing to step out on a political limb just because Trump is a Republican. This isn t exactly bravery on McConnell s part, but it does show that perhaps impeachment might not be far behind. McConnell would much rather work with a President Mike Pence.Featured image via video screen capture. ",News,5-Feb-17
 Kellyanne Conway Throws A MASSIVE Hissy Fit On Fox After Getting Caught Making Up Fake Terrorist Attack,"Unable to spew her lies and excuses on CNN, Kellyanne Conway appeared on Fox News instead on Sunday to defend her  Bowling Green massacre  remarks and lash out at her critics.During an interview with Chris Matthews on MSNBC last week, Conway referenced an investigation that occurred during the Obama Administration in order to Donald Trump s unconstitutional Muslim ban that he signed over a week ago and caused worldwide chaos ever since.Conway claimed that President Obama banned immigration from Iraq for six months after two Iraqi immigrants were caught plotting a terrorist attack and were arrested in Bowling Green, Kentucky. I bet it s brand new information to people that President Obama had a 6-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. It didn t get covered. Donald Trump used the same claim to defend his ban.However, Politifact pointed out that Trump s claim that his ban is the same is a lie.Trump said,  My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The Obama administration in 2011 delayed processing Iraqi refugees for six months following evidence of a failed plot by two Iraqi refugees.Trump s executive order temporarily bars travel to the United States for all citizens from seven countries, and it is not in direct response to actions from citizens of those countries.Furthermore, Iraqi refugees were nonetheless admitted to the United States during the 2011 suspension while Trump has put an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees.We rate Trump s claim Mostly False.So Conway just got busted for lying. And she proceeded to lie more during her interview on Fox. They re masterminds, I had said that before,  Conway said.  I should have said plot or I should have just called them terrorists. I clarified immediately. I should have said terrorists and not massacre. I m sure it will live on for a week. First of all, switching words would make Conway s statement to Chris Matthews make even less sense. They were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green terrorists,  is how it would read.Second, Conway did not  immediately  correct her own claim. She waited 13 hours and by the time she corrected herself, her comments were all over the news. She literally made up a fake terrorist attack to justify Trump s travel ban.Conway called her critics  haters  and complained that she only misspoke by one word. I misspoke one word. The corrections in the newspapers that are attacking me are three paragraphs long every day. Seriously. And Trump supporters think liberals are  snowflakes. Kellyanne Conway s skin is just as thin as Trump s.Featured image via Yana Paskova/Getty Images ",News,5-Feb-17
 WATCH: Melissa McCarthy Adds To SNL’s Trump Admin Ridicule In GLORIOUS Sean Spicer Spoof,"Saturday Night Live is having a high old time ruthlessly mocking the governmental train wreck that is the fledgling, incompetent Trump administration. First, they returned Alec Baldwin to his role as Trump, and re-enacted his absolutely disastrous first two weeks in office. Then, they debuted Melissa McCarthy as White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer   specifically his bizarre meltdown where he scolded the press regarding Trump s continuing obsession with having a smaller inaugural crowd size than President Obama did.McCarthy appeared in an ill-fitting suit, much like the one Spicer wore to tear into the press during his very first official appearance as Press Secretary, and yelled and screamed, and even swallowed bunches of gum, in a mockery of the report that Spicer has a problem where he eats and swallows copious amounts of Orbit cinnamon gum daily. As he does this, McCarthy/Spicer says: I m here to swallow gum and take names! When challenged by a reporter at one point, McCarthy/Spicer took out a super soaker gun and shot the reporter with water. The spoof even had McCarthy/Spicer pick up the press podium and attempt to attack reporters with it. The erratic press secretary insisted on apology from the press for how they are treating Trump   and him: Apologize to me! That apology is NOT accepted! This is hilarious, but it is also scary, considering how close it is to the person who is currently serving as the actual White House Press Secretary.Watch the clip below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,5-Feb-17
 Alec Baldwin Returns To SNL To Blast Trump’s Humiliatingly Terrible Calls With World Leaders (VIDEO),"After what seemed like an agonizingly long wait, Alec Baldwin returned to Saturday Night Live after a particularly humiliating series of phone calls with world leaders in which Donald Trump somehow managed to start an international incident with Australia   a nation that has had our back since around World War I   and probably threatened to send troops to Mexico.Baldwin s Trump tackled (with the aid of a skeleton masked and robed President Steve Bannon) The Donald s calls with world leaders, including ones that didn t happen but should have. He also calls German Chancellor Angela Merkel (Trump would call her  President  based on his interactions with Australia s Prime Minister), who clearly desperately misses Barack Obama. He also tells her about his upcoming memoir:  My Struggle  (we ll let you Google the German translation for that if you don t already know it).The highlight of the cold open is Baldwin s call with Zimbabwe s President Robert Mugabe, who called tells  Trump : You think you are a real dictator? I will rip out your spine and drink from your skull! You cannot even walk down stairs, you little white b*tch! Don t you ever call Zimbabwe again! While Trump has not given him the courtesy of a phone call in the real world, Mugabe (the one who isn t played by Keenan Thompson) recently wondered if there are enough doctors in America to handle Trump, whom he says is Hitler s grandson.After Trump, with Bannon the dark specter who is really running the show whispering in his ear, had their fun, Bannon tells The Donald that s enough fun for tonight  and asks for his desk back. Yes, of course, Mr. President,  the orange-skinned puppet replies as he slinks off to play with his toys. Watch it below:Featured image via screengrab",News,5-Feb-17
" Democrat Examines Trump’s Latest Twitter Meltdown, Asks The ONE Question We Were ALL Wondering (DETAILS)","Donald Trump s presidency is still one of the most baffling train wrecks Americans have seen in a long time. If his racist, misogynist rhetoric and pathological lying weren t enough to raise concerns about, his Twitter activity alone should have prevented people from voting for him   and for those that had hope for him, he s been busy proving them wrong every single day since he got in the White House.He hasn t even lasted a month in his new role yet, and already people are scrambling to find ways to get rid of him before he destroys the country. With his massive amounts of inhumane executive orders and reckless handling of world affairs, Trump s mental competency is under scrutiny   and for good reason.On Saturday, Trump launched into one of his insane Twitter fits, and this time he was more incoherent than ever. He not only whined about  FAKE NEWS  and the New York Times, but he attacked the  so-called judge  who dared to block his disgusting Muslim ban. Oh, and let s not forget about the fact that Trump also shared a fake article about Kuwait, forcing the country to respond and the situation to erupt in chaos before the situation was corrected.Given the emotional roller coaster that the Trump presidency has already become in such a short amount of time, many people are calling for him to have a psychological review   and one of those people is Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), who took a look at Trump s Twitter tantrum and asked the question we ve all been wanting to know. Here it is: Should he get a mental health exam? Hell YES. A few hours later, Lieu fired back at Trump again for posting yet another weird, narcissistic tweet: his campaign slogan,  Make America Great Again. It would be in America s best interest if Trump were professionally evaluated. Lieu is not the only politician calling for a psychological review, either. Earlier this week, top Democrat Nancy Pelosi spoke out in support of having mental evaluations for presidents   which we all know would have destroyed every chance Trump had.Like him or hate him, Trump is not well and being in his role is not only dangerous for him, but for the rest of the world.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,5-Feb-17

On Saturday out borders reopened after Judge James Robert blocked President Asterisk s Muslim ban, correctly pointing out that there is  no support  for The Donald s argument that we have to protect the U.S. from individuals  from the seven countries affected by the ban.Robert s decision, which also block the Trump administration from enforcing its limits on refugees, was celebrated nationwide as Trump and his allies stewed and our  so-called President  unleashed a ridiculous attack on the  so-called judge  who foiled his evil scheme.

I m also asked to look and determine if the executive order is rationally based,  Robart told Trump s attorney.  Rationally based to me at least implies to some extent I have to find it grounded in facts as opposed to fiction.  Trump s attorney s baffled the world, responding that the facts simply do not matter: Well Your Honor, we don t think you re supposed to look at whether it s rationally based. We think that the standard is facially legitimate.

Our so-called  president  called a Bush-appointed federal judge a  so-called  judge, and he s throwing a tantrum because said judge took his ball away after he threw it at someone else s head. CNN s Michael Smerconish really let loose: So-called judge? It s a federal judge appointed by President George W. Bush. I try and show the office of the president respect in the way that he ought to be showing respect for a member of the federal judiciary. And Trump refused to show that respect with these tweets. He insulted the entire judiciary branch, and also insulted his own office when he whined and cried and screamed that the judicial branch is doing its job. Watch Smerconish s takedown below:In addition to doing some basic reading on how the judicial branch works, he needs to stop pretending that we have no idea who s coming into the country simply because enforcement of his order has been halted. He s insulting the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection when he says that.

" In Shocking Interview, Donald Trump Admitted That Killing Political Enemies Is No Big Deal (VIDEO)","It s tough these days to keep track of exactly how many shadow governments are propping up Donald Trump. Steve Bannon is the de facto President. Mike Pence is reportedly the puppet master behind all the LGBT hate and anti-abortion positions. But let s not forget that the ultimate Trump puppet master isn t even an American, it s Russian President Vladimir Putin and on an edition of The O Reilly Factor that will appear on Super Bowl Sunday, Trump refused to say anything bad about Putin at all.Bill O Reilly is rarely the voice of reason, but this is a time of such absurdity that even Glenn Beck is warning us of the insanity of Trump. Still, compared to Trump, O Reilly is downright sane. Even he recognized the dangers of having Putin s hand up the you know what of the person who s supposed to be the leader of the Western World.In the interview, Trump was asked about Putin. He s still trying to claim that he never met the Russian leader, despite that being widely debunked. He once said that he met with Putin in Russia and the man  could not have been nicer.  When O Reilly talked about Putin, though, Trump played dumb: I do respect him, I respect a lot of people,  Trump says in a clip of the interview released Saturday.  That doesn t mean I m going to get along with him. Trump goes on to say that if Russia aids the U.S. in the fight against ISIS,  then that s a good thing. Source: Hollywood ReporterWhen asked about the fact that Putin is a killer, Trump merely shrugged it off and said that the United States isn t so innocent.O Reilly, host of Factor, retorts with about Putin,  he s a killer, though. Putin s a killer. There are a lot of killers. We got a lot of killers,  Trump says.  What, you think our country is so innocent? Here s the video:It s becoming increasingly more clear every day that Donald Trump absolutely loathes the United States. No, our country is certainly not innocent, but we don t have recent evidence of any of our presidents poisoning those who disagree with him. (The worst similar thing, that we know of, is the outing of a CIA agent who disagreed with Dick Cheney and the weapons of mass destruction claim). It s definitely not too early to rule that possibility out when it comes to Trump, though. The way he lashes out at anyone who dares say anything against him is straight from the playbook of a third rate dictator and Trump s puppet master Putin is far from just third rate. Watch for Trump to be following in Putin s footsteps and with tacit approval of killing political enemies, it s apparent that nothing is off limits for this new administration. Be afraid. Be very afraid.Featured image via video screen capture",News,4-Feb-17
 WATCH: Hypocrite Mike Pence Calls Democratic Obstruction Of Trump’s Supreme Court Nominee ‘Unprecedented’,"This is unbelievably outrageous.Republicans are literally pretending that the last eight years never happened.In February 2016, Justice Antonin Scalia passed away, leaving a vacancy on the Supreme Court that President Obama was responsible to fill. But Scalia s body was not even cold before Republicans vowed to block any nominee he selected for the position.And so, Republicans did just that and refused to even grant Merrick Garland a hearing despite the fact that he is a moderate centrist who enjoyed support from Republicans in the past.Republicans excused their unprecedented behavior by claiming that lame-duck presidents can t pick Supreme Court nominees and claimed that the American people should get a say in November about who should pick the next Supreme Court Justice.Th GOP has three problems here. First, President Obama was elected twice by the American people and therefore had the right to choose the nominee. Second, there is plenty of historical examples of presidents picking Supreme Court nominees and getting them confirmed during their final year in office. Ronald Reagan is one of them. And finally, the American people did not vote for Donald Trump, they voted for Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes.So Trump definitely does not have a mandate and Republicans do not have any excuses for their obstruction.But Democrats certainly do have a really good excuse to block Trump s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the high court. After all, Republicans created the new precedent last year by refusing to confirm Garland. Republicans literally stole a Supreme Court seat from President Obama and the Democratic Party.But Mike Pence claims that even threatening to obstruct Trump s nominee is  unprecedented. During a speech to the Federalist Society, Pence promised that Gorsuch  will pick up where Scalia left off.  In other words, he ll be a complete dick who wants to repeal every Supreme Court ruling that protects the rights of women, minorities, gay people, the environment, etc until this nation is taken all the way back to the 1850s.And then he said this. Several announced their opposition within minutes of his nomination, and now they re even threatening to use the filibuster procedure in the Senate to stop him. Make no mistake about it, this is an unwise and an unprecedented act .This seat does not belong to any party or any ideology or any interest group, this seat on the Supreme Court belongs to the American people, and the American people deserve a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. Here s the video via YouTube.Democrats should block Trump s Supreme Court pick at all costs. Turnabout is fair play and Republicans are hypocrites for whining about obstruction when they are the ones who totally disrespected President Obama and Merrick Garland in the first place. They only have themselves to blame for what Democrats are threatening to do and they have no right to complain after the way they acted last year. If Republicans wanted Democrats to cooperate with Trump, they should have thought about that before acting like complete traitors toward President Obama.Republicans wanted the Supreme Court to just have eight justices and that has lasted for a year now. It s time for Democrats to extend that wait to another four years. And if Republicans change the rules to force Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, Democrats should impeach him and Trump when they get control of Congress and show Republicans what the word  unprecedented  really means.Featured image via screenshot",News,4-Feb-17
 WATCH: White Grievance Queen Tomi Lahren Gets OWNED For Being Racist,"Tomi Lahren appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday night and got totally owned for spewing her racist bullshit.Bill Maher wondered if Trump would have been elected president had he been black instead of white. What do you think if Trump was black,  Maher asked his panel. Maher described a scenario where Trump is black and has had three wives and brags about grabbing women  by the p*ssy.  Would he still have been elected?Michael Eric Dyson s response was that black Trump would not even be running for president because he would be in prison.Indeed, black people end up in prison for doing a lot of the same shit white people usually get away with. That s why black people make up a larger portion of the prison population.No black person would have been elected president by acting like Trump.Lahren responded that it wouldn t have bothered her at all if Trump were a black man, which we all know is a complete lie. I don t think it would matter,  she said, drawing shock and outrage from the audience because even they knew Lahren was lying.Maher asked Lahren about the fact that over 60 percent of Republicans believe that discrimination against white people is as bad as discrimination against black people.Lahren tried to side-step the question but Maher repeated it again. Lahren then teeter-tottered in her answer, saying that there s an  element  of this that is true but appeared to admit that Republicans are wrong to make that claim.That s when Republican strategies Rick Wilson spoke up and absolutely nailed Lahren. Since I m a conservative and not a Trump person, let me say this,  Wilson said.  That s absurd. That s f*cking crazy. Here s the video via VidMe.Later on, Lahren blamed President Obama for the loss of coal mining jobs in this country. As we all know, President Obama sought to reduce and prevent the effects of climate change by issuing rules stopping the coal industry from polluting, but Lahren had the gall to defend Republicans for recently repealing those rules. So once again, the coal industry will be able to dump waste in waterways.Maher argued that these coal miners could be trained to do other kinds of jobs, such as renewable energy jobs that are safer for workers and better for the environment. Lahren treated the coal miners like they are incapable of learning to do something new, as if they were all marked to be coal miners at birth.Once again, Rick Wilson shut her down. There s a kind of hazy nostalgia with Trump s plan,  We re going to have ironworks and shipyards and coal miners,  Wilson said.

" Howard Stern Says Trump Is ‘Pissed’ That He Won, Has A ‘Sensitive Ego’ (AUDIO)","Donald Trump is apparently really angry that he won the election in November because he only wanted more money from NBC and didn t want his fragile ego to get shattered.Longtime Trump friend Howard Stern talked about his buddy on Wednesday and had a lot to say.And Trump is probably going to hate it because the truth hurts.Stern says that he warned Trump against running because if he wins the presidency it will take a toll on his mental health because his ego is so  sensitive. I personally wish that he had never run. I told him that because I actually think this is something that is going to be detrimental to his mental health He really does want to be loved, he does want people to really love him, that drives him a lot. I think he has a very sensitive ego. Indeed, we witness Trump s fragile ego every time he tweets in retaliation of someone criticizing him. Saturday Night Live and Alec Baldwin have been targeted in particularly because they have satirized him relentlessly.Stern then explained that Trump is desperate to be adored by celebrities and is only lashing out at Hollywood and the press because he loves them so much but the feeling isn t returned. He s now on this anti-Hollywood kick. He loves Hollywood. First of all, he loves the press. He lives for it. He loves people in Hollywood. He only wants hobnob with them. All of this hatred and stuff directed towards him. It s not good for him. It s not good. There s a reason every president who leaves the office has grey hair. Finally, Stern revealed that Trump is not happy at all about actually winning the presidency. As many people claimed during the election, Trump apparently did want to lose to Hillary Clinton. The only real reason Trump ran for office was to force NBC to pay him more money to come back and host  The Apprentice.  And that s why Trump wants voter fraud investigations, so he can be forced out of office without quitting. He just wanted a couple more bucks out of NBC, and that is why Donald is calling for voter fraud investigations. He s pissed he won. He still wants Hillary Clinton to win. He s so f*cking pissed, he s hoping that he can find some voter fraud and hand it over to Hillary. Wait, NBC could have prevented this disaster from taking over the White House had they just opened their wallet a little more? Seriously?! Well that explains why Trump is angry at NBC all the time. Clearly, it s not just because of Alec Baldwin and SNL.Here s the audio via YouTube.Howard Stern has known Trump for decades so if he says something about him we should believe him. Trump s ego is fragile and he is desperate for everyone to love him. And he did appear to do everything possible to lose the election. If Trump doesn t want to be president there is nothing wrong with resigning. However, if Trump really wants to be loved by everyone, he can make that happen by moving our country forward instead of taking it backwards. He can start by revoking his executive orders and putting people in charge of government agencies who are not racist anti-government extremists. Removing Steve Bannon would also help. Instead of tearing down President Obama s legacy, Trump should build upon it. If he is truly as good at building things as he claims, this shouldn t be hard for him to accomplish.The presidency would be easier and he would get the love he has been seeking.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,4-Feb-17
 Trump Goes On UNHINGED Early Morning Twitter Tirade; Attacks Federal Judge Over Muslim Ban,"One of Donald Trump s most controversial campaign promises was his  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  Now that the power of the presidency is his, Trump tried to do just that last weekend. However, the executive order that enacted the Muslim ban was poorly rolled out, bypassed scrutiny by the agencies charged with enforcing it, and caused protests to erupt nationally and internationally. Further, everyone saw it for what it was: the unconstitutional religious test for entering the United States that Trump had promised on the campaign trail.After a slew of judges struck down parts of the ban, one federal judge, appointed by President George W. Bush, James Robart of Seattle, struck the whole discriminatory policy down. Of course, this didn t sit well with Trump, and he did as he always done with confronted with any sort of criticism or challenge whatsoever, and went on an absolutely crazy Twitter tirade against Judge Robart early Saturday morning. Here are Trump s latest nutty tweets:When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security   big trouble!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017Of course, Trump s claims that other countries agree with his ban are patently false. There are protests around the world regarding his bigoted and un-American policies and rhetoric. He has only been in office for two weeks, and has already diminished America s standing in the world greatly by trying to whitewash America and shut out immigrants.Though entirely predictable, Trump s reaction here is highly problematic. He is clearly unraveling at the protests and criticisms against him, and having actual judges rule against him is just too much. What will be really interesting to see is whether or not Trump tries to see how he can remove this judge, just as he did with the Acting Attorney General who said that his Muslim ban was indefensible in court.This man is a literal fascist, America, and we are witnessing his slow destruction of our democracy as we speak. #RESIST.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,4-Feb-17
 CNN Just Told Kellyanne Conway To Go F*ck Herself In The BEST Way Possible (TWEETS),"Vice President Mike Pence chose to appear on ABC, NBC, CBS and (of course) Fox News this Sunday, but is snubbing CNN following the Trump administration s announcement that surrogates will not appear on networks that do not  promote  his agenda.CNN reached out to the White House and according to a spokeswoman they were offered Trump s propaganda minister Kellyanne Conway, the woman responsible for  alternative facts  as an alternative to  lies  and the infamous Bowling Green Massacre that killed the credibility of anyone remotely associated with Donald Trump.Now CNN could have taken what they were offered, but this is a woman who spends the majority of her time screaming about  fake news  and attacking anyone who confronts her with anything resembling a fact. Because of this, CNN did what everyone should do and told Conway to f*ck off.Brian Stelter, host of CNN s  Reliable Sources,  tweeted Friday that  In lieu of Pence, the W.H. offered Kellyanne Conway for an interview, but CNN declined. Per a CNN spokeswoman: In lieu of Pence, the W.H. offered Kellyanne Conway for an interview, but CNN declined https://t.co/qVDgi5jWOa  Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 4, 2017Stelter recently questioned whether any news organization should allow Conway to run her mouth in a tweet promoting his column on the Bowling Green Massacre.

 Trump Administration IRATE After Judge Halts His Muslim Ban AGAIN (TWEETS),"Following a Boston judge s refusal to renew the temporary stay on Trump s Muslim ban, a federal judge in Seattle issued a stay that applies to every port of entry in the entire nation. That s all the entry points along the northern and southern borders, as well as every airport that has incoming international flights, and anywhere else people enter the U.S.And, of course, the White House is livid, because how dare the judicial branch tell them what they can and cannot do?! Sean Spicer issued an outraged tweetstorm in response to the judge s order:Statement on WA court ruling:  At the earliest possible time, the Department of Justice intends to file an emergency stay of the order (1/5)  Sean Spicer (@PressSec) February 4, 2017(2/5)and defend the executive order of the President, which we believe is lawful and appropriate. The president s order is intended to  Sean Spicer (@PressSec) February 4, 2017(3/6) protect the country and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people. As the law states,  Sean Spicer (@PressSec) February 4, 2017(4/6)  Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental  Sean Spicer (@PressSec) February 4, 2017(5/6)to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all  Sean Spicer (@PressSec) February 4, 2017(6/6)aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on entry of aliens any restrictions may deem 2 b appropriate.  Sean Spicer (@PressSec) February 4, 2017U.S. Customs and Border Protection has already said that it will reinstate visas from the blacklisted countries, and likewise has already informed airlines of that fact. This isn t sitting well with an administration that thinks it can do whatever it wants simply because Trump  is the president.  White House attorneys even said: Every President over the last thirty years has invoked this authority to suspend or impose restrictions on the entry of certain aliens or classes of aliens, in some instances including classifications based on nationality. Yeah, no, not like this. When it was done before, it was done with caution, with extensive counsel, in response to very specific and known threats, and they weren t out-and-out bans. Trump s order is very broad, did not include much in the way of the necessary consultations, and is not in response to any specific threat. It s based on paranoid lunacy, actually. If they re going to invoke history, they should actually go and read history.There s a lawsuit against Trump over this order, and the disparate rulings between Seattle and Boston may well send this case to the Supreme Court. The Seattle ruling says: The executive order adversely affects the states  residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel  In addition, the States themselves are harmed by virtue of the damage that implementation of the Executive Order has inflicted upon the operations and missions of their public universities and other institutions of higher learning, as well as injury to the States  operations, tax bases and public funds. These harms are significant and ongoing. But Trump and his minions have no idea how to work within the laws of this land, let alone consider the consequences of anything at all. He is acting as a despot king, and his clones specifically Sean Spicer and Kellyanne Conway see it the same way to the point where they lie through their teeth and get outraged at anyone they think should blindly follow them for having ideas of their own.Spicer ought to shut his mouth, along with everyone else, and let the big kids handle this.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images",News,4-Feb-17
 Trump Wanted To Attack The LGBTQ Community; Jared And Ivanka Said Hell No (DETAILS),"Earlier in the week, there were leaked draft executive orders circulating that would strike President Obama s executive order protections for LGBTQ federal workers. There were also rumors that Donald Trump would sign a sweeping, broadly worded  religious freedom  bill into law that would effectively legalize discrimination nationwide. However, Trump and his famously homophobic vice president, Mike Pence, ran into a road block: Trump s kids. Specifically, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka Trump.Jared and Ivanka have long been seen to be the reasonable, moderating influences that are needed to calm Trump s impulsive, erratic temperament. It appears that this is what happened here. Ivanka and Jared see all of the fear and the protests in the streets against Trump, and they feared that there would be even more national and international backlash against Trump s bigotry via executive order. Therefore, there was a complete reversal on these orders.Of course, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer outright lied when asked about it. He insisted that these orders were just a couple out of hundreds that were being considered. Then, of course, a statement was hastily rushed out, saying that the Trump administration is  determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the LGBTQ community. Considering all of the virulently anti-LGBTQ people Trump has around him   namely Mike Pence   I don t believe that for so much as a second. If Ivanka and Jared can keep Trump s hands away from the LGBTQ community for the time being, though, all the better. Hopefully it will hold until 2018, and we manage to take Congress back, thus crippling the amount of damage Trump and Pence can do until they are out of office.While their reasons were political rather than noble, at this point, it s better than nothing.Featured image via Aaron P.

 Alec Baldwin Just TRASHED President Bannon And His ‘Dim-Witted Second’ Donald Trump (TWEETS),"Donald Trump is terrible, and we are reminded of this daily   but after a week of disastrous foreign policy flubs and embarrassing gaffes related to Fredrick Douglass and terrorist attacks that didn t happen, Alec Baldwin was, as usual, there to blast The Donald for his idiocy. Trump is, quite simply, a man who was never embraced by his hometown, by NY society. Not even middle-of-road Repubs. Always peripheral,  Baldwin said as he began his assault.  Now he aims, out of spite, to destroy everything they hold dear. For Trump and Bannon, the question is always,  What will drive liberal NY crazy?' 1-Trump is, quite simply, a man who was never embraced by his hometown, by NY society.

ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) February 4, 2017The actions of President Bannon and tangerine puppet Donald Trump have been unstable at best, including diverting federal funds to pay for their stupid wall, threatening to send troops to Mexico, messing up relations with Australia (the  easy mode  of diplomacy), and threatening war with Iran via Twitter.Baldwin says that there is a positive to the horrifying the actions of the Trump administration: they present an opportunity to  prove, once again, the greatness of our country: that this racist maniac (Bannon) + his dim-witted 2nd cannot bring us down.

ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) February 4, 2017The idea of a travel ban is not out of the question. Iran recently responded to Trump s Muslim ban, which includes Iran, by prohibiting U.S. wrestlers from coming to their country for the freestyle World Cup. Training comes to a halt. We re like  OK, what do we do now? Where do we go? Where do we compete?'  wrestler Jordan Burroughs said on Friday.  I m just bummed. I love Iran. I love their people, and I don t get into politics. I wasn t going to make a political stance. I was going to compete. These decisions, these executive decisions, are always so far beyond your reach,  Burroughs says.  Like, you always feel like  Well, the presidency or these strict laws or these Muslim bans or whatever you like to call them, they ll never affect me.  This is one of the few times where something so personal has occurred. Almost like it (was) handed down from the president to us. It s a bummer. Donald Trump is bad for America, and his policies are hurting everyone, but at least we can count on Alec Baldwin to occasionally give us a little levity (and, of course, send Trump into some of his more epic tantrums).Baldwin hosts Saturday Night Live on February 11.

 Trump Supporter Uses Patton Oswalt’s Dead Wife To Attack Him And Gets Righteously FIRED From His Job,"Again, when will conservatives learn that their hateful social media activity can cost them their employment?Because a real estate agent in Peoria, Illinois learned that the hard way this week after he viciously attacked comedian Patton Oswalt on Twitter for posting in support of former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates after Yates was fired by Donald Trump for refusing to enforce an unconstitutional Muslim ban.Trump:  You leave this White House now!  Sally Yates rides bus to city. Becomes a taxi dancer. Leads dance revolt against pimp. Triumphs.  Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) January 31, 2017Apparently, that was enough to set off Trump supporter Tony Brust, who proceeded to attack Oswalt with a series of tweets that have since been deleted. I Tweeted out a very positive, very benign Tweet in support of Sally Yates, and her risky stand on principle, which cost her her job,  Oswalt recounted on Facebook.  The realtor s response Tweet was along the lines of,  Oh, the nasty little troll has another opinion. Stick to show business and shut up.  I m paraphrasing. Another person who hates my Twitter feed s content who nevertheless follows me. I Tweeted out something in support of someone. He reacted with immediate disgust and offense. Fine, whatever. Oswalt has dealt with hateful Trump supporters before so he is used to ignoring them. Except this time, Brust decided to make things incredibly personal and actually used Oswalt s deceased wife to attack him. I m a psychic and I m channeling his wife s opinions,  Brust wrote in response to one Twitter user who asked everyone to stop having opinions.Needless to say, the remark was a deep stab to Oswalt, who was not having a good day.His wife Michelle McNamara had passed away not even a year ago and he is still dealing with the pain of his loss.As soon as Brust posted his comment he had made a serious mistake as Twitter users were quick to inform Brust s employer of how nasty he was being on social media. Not only was this Twitter exchange very public, Brust was using his professional Twitter account to do it.Would ve happily ignored Tony Brust if he hadn t sent THIS Tweet. But he did and it caught me at a dark moment: pic.twitter.com/yflAMuSAqo  Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) January 31, 2017At that point, Oswalt began trolling Brust, and at some point, he noticed that Brust had removed his social media accounts. And then Oswalt discovered that Brust s employer had posted a notice on the company website making clear that they did not want to be associated with him and the nasty things he said.I saw that other people were giving him shit about the  dead wife  joke. I figured it was going to blow up in the poor slob s face without zero help from me. In the morning, his account was gone. He d closed it down (I assume). He d also closed down his Facebook profile and professional page. And then the realty company he worked for posted a message to their website about how Mr. Dead Wife Joke did NOT represent their company and that he was no longer employed by them.Indeed, the Chicago Tribune tracked down Michael Maloof, owner of the real estate agency, and learned that Brust had been fired. We were made aware that this had gone on and we parted company,  Maloof said.So here we are once again. Another Trump supporter/racist/conservative has been fired and he only has himself to blame. Rather than just simply disagree with Oswalt and move on, Brust chose to publicly harass a celebrity. He attacked Oswalt in a way that threatened the reputation of his employer. Because while businesses don t really care about the political affiliations of the employees, they definitely care about what their employers say and how they say it in public. The Internet is forever and while Brust deleted most of his tweets, he wasn t able to erase every one of them. And now he is unemployed for being a total dick.Conservatives have previously been fired for publicly attacking Michelle Obama using racist remarks, which cause all sorts of problems for businesses because business owners care about their reputation and image. How employees represent themselves can have positive or negative effects on the business.But since Donald trump took office, his supporters have been emboldened to say and do things that disgust the rest of civilized society. And they actually believe they can get away with it without consequences just because Trump has taken over the White House.As Oswalt concluded in his Facebook post, Trump supporters are wrong to think that way.The main thing that Trump supporters are excited about, now that he s president? Is that finally, at LOOOOOONG LAST, all of the awful things they want to say, that used to lose them friends and jobs and marriages? They re EXCITED about potentially getting to say them with ZERO repercussions. Just like Trump did. All the way into the White House. All the way into unlimited, forever power to spew any awful shit that comes to your head and no one dares correct you, rolls their eyes, or punches you in the nose.But I m afraid Peoria Realtor is going to be the first in a long line of Trumpers who will realize, on the other side of firings and divorces and black eyes, that Trump s Teflon Umbrella covers Trump and no one else.Featured image via YouTube",News,3-Feb-17
 Donald Trump Is Even Making Enemies Of The Koch Brothers; Here’s Why,"Since Citizens United, and even before, two names have been consistent Republican stalwarts and Republican donors. Before Donald Trump, it was apparent that the Republican party was owned by the Koch brothers and Walmart, both of whom are ardent supporters of free trade and cheap labor. Now, Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan are making enemies of both, and the Republican party is in turmoil.In June, before Trump was even elected, Republicans began their war on imports by sketching a  blueprint  for tax reform that would make imports a lot more expensive, and these days, pretty much everything you and I buy is an import.Trump didn t love Congress  original plan, but his plan would add a 20 percent import tax to imports from Mexico. The Kochs and Walmart aren t happy about that.The GOP confusion is mirrored by a scrambling of alliances on K Streets that hasn t been seen in living memory.  Trump more than any president I ve seen has created a little bit of chaos within some client rosters. He s not afraid to pit people against each other,  said one lobbyist who has clients that may wind up on both sides of the issue. When that happens, lobby shops will have to pick which side they re on. But as long as it s just a vague concept, that reckoning can wait.  Theres no legislative text. We don t have a conflict until we have a bill,  he said.Corporate America has had plenty of intramural matches over the years. But rewriting the tax code is a dozen Super Bowls played all on the same day. Manufacturers, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell and pharmaceutical companies, have quickly organized to praise the border tax. Retailers, including Walmart, Target and Kohl s, are trying to kill it. They re joined by right-wing megadonors Charles and David Koch. In December, Koch Industries   which imports crude and tar sands oil to be refined in the United States   said the House GOP plan would  adversely impact American consumers by forcing them to pay higher prices on products   they use every single day.  Prices at the pump, they have warned, would skyrocket, and nothing gets a member of Congress  attention faster than the flipping numbers at an Exxon station.Source: Huffington PostThis puts Congress in a tough spot, and as liberals, we should be grabbing the popcorn. The Kochs and the Waltons (Walmart heirs) are huge GOP donors and in return, they expect that wages will be kept low (Republicans are still happy to accommodate), regulations will be kept to a minimum (again, Republicans are on board) and imports will be kept cheap.While this infighting is great for us and ultimately, for the country (the Republican party will be hurting without their cash, which will increase our chances of regaining Congress and state houses in 2018), it does put us in a weird position. Defending the Kochs and Walmart is pretty much against everything we stand for, but they also have their fingers on the pulse of red state America. As Americans start paying a premium for their Bounty paper towels and Walmart crap, people will start to revolt, and thanks to the Kochs and the Waltons, they ll know who to revolt against.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,3-Feb-17
 U.S. Taxpayers Were On The Hook For Trump’s Corruption Before He Was Even Inaugurated,"Ethics? Divestment? We ve known for awhile that these two words are alien to Trump and his family, but until recently, we didn t really have a solid example of the corruption that this would sow within the administration. Now we do   in early January, Eric Trump took a short trip to Uruguay to promote the Trump Organization, and we taxpayers were left on the hook for a lot of the cost.Eric Trump, being Trump s immediate family, gets Secret Service protection like his daddy. So we, the taxpayers, paid for hotel rooms, flights, and incidentals for the Secret Service to be there protecting Eric while he ate at beach-front restaurants, mingled with presumably important real estate brokers, and went to an ultra-exclusive party. We re on the hook for roughly $100,000 right now.Some will say that s nothing compared to Obama s supposedly extravagant vacations. Some will say that even if it s not government business, a little here and there won t hurt (especially compared to how many taxpayer dollars they re just certain Obama wasted on himself). Those who make these claims will be ignoring one very important fact: Obama wasn t using taxpayer dollars to pay for his own and his family s protection while he was busy promoting a commercial enterprise that is supposed to be 100 percent separate from the government.There s a word for this: Corruption. Political corruption, by definition, is a government official (or the entire government) using public resources for private gain. Or, as the Washington Post put it: In this case, government agencies are forced to pay to support business operations that ultimately help to enrich the president himself. Trump has been in office for a whole two weeks, and Eric went to Uruguay before he took office. Even so, as the President-elect at the time, it was still on us to pay for the Secret Service, and for the U.S. Embassy in Uruguay to have staff at the hotel for this  VIP visit.  It s not unusual for family members to travel independently of the president, but when was the last time a president s family members used public dollars to promote private business interests?This is sick.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,3-Feb-17

 Sweden OPENLY Makes Fun Of Trump On Twitter With All-Female Signing Pic; It’s AMAZING,"If you haven t noticed by now, Donald Trump has been signing a lot of executive orders, and the scene usually looks something like this:WASHINGTON, DC   JANUARY 23: (AFP OUT) U.S. President Donald Trump shows the Executive Order (Photo by Ron Sachs   Pool/Getty Images)Most of the pictures are of Trump surrounded by a bunch of men. One of the orders even reinstated  the global gag rule on overseas discussion of abortion by individuals and organizations receiving federal funding. Needless to say, Trump is no friend to women. After all, he s admitted to being a sexual predator. So, in response to all these obscenely male-dominated photos, Sweden just trolled Trump back with an image of their own.Isabella L vin, Sweden s Deputy Prime Minister, who is also Minister for International Development Cooperation and Climate, tweeted out: Just signed referral of Swedish #climate law, binding all future governments to net zero emissions by 2045.

 Kellyanne Conway Says Trump Should Be Treated With The Respect He Deserves (AUDIO),"Whiny White House advisor Kellyanne Conway does not like how the media treats her illegitimate president, Donald Trump. She s continuing her crusade against the First Amendment. Interestingly, she, President Steve Bannon, and Trump, have treated the press very badly, yet they feel they should get favorable coverage anyway. Conway appeared on Sean Hannity s radio show, and talked about how mean the press is to Donald.Hannity asked Conway if the media at large was being  beyond disrespectful  to Trump and his staff, according to Mediaite. Conway agreed then said that the coverage was  inciting mob mentality if not mob violence. The coverage never changed [of Trump]. It never progressed, it never matured,  Conway said.Conway said she thought protesters had  a very low level of literacy  of the issues against which they demonstrated, when the truth is that her boss s grammar sits at just below a 6th grade level. It never took on the aura of respect that it deserved, and if you are not showing the President and his main spokespeople respect, then you re not showing the office respect, and you are inciting mob mentality if not mob violence,  she said.  You are encouraging people to go out there and unpeacefully protest and block airport entrances for people who are going to visit a sick parent and can t make their flight, or are going for a bereavement call and can t make their flight. Listen below:People are treating Donald with the respect he deserves. Protesters know exactly why they went to airports across the country. People were being unconstitutionally detained and handcuffed, even children. Conway said at the time that the whole idea that these people are being separated from their families is  temporary.  She called it an  inconvenience.  So, Kellyanne, just consider the treatment Trump is getting an  inconvenience,  and something that is  temporary  until his impeachment.She literally complained that the press is being mean to Donald to a Fox News host who treated former President Barack Obama like dirt for 8 years . Quit being so PC, Kellyanne. Conservatives tell me it s destroying our country.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images.",News,3-Feb-17
 Over 40 Percent Of America Supports Impeaching Donald Trump,"President Trump has started his presidency out in the worst possible way: His inauguration turnout was dismal; his most controversial executive action has been halted; his cabinet is facing confirmation troubles; his approval rating is at an historic low; and now, 40 percent of the American public supports impeaching him.A new poll released by Public Policy Polling shows that, while 4 in 10 support his impeachment, only 48 percent do not. Twelve percent are (still) unsure at this point.That s not a lot of wiggle room. That s actually close to evenly split.The most fascinating parts? The 40 percent mark is up five points from where it was just a week ago. Also, the poll found that 3 percent of Trump voters want to see him impeached.According the analysis:Usually a newly elected President is at the peak of their popularity and enjoying their honeymoon period after taking office right now. But Donald Trump s making history once again with a sizable share of voters already wanting to impeach him, and a majority of voters wishing they could have Barack Obama back.The poll also found that the overall impressions of President Trump continue to remain negative, with 52 percent of the American public viewing him unfavorably, and 45 percent viewing him favorably. These numbers are almost identical to a recently released poll from CNN, which show his disapproval rating at 53 percent.Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Democrat from Texas and potential Senate candidate for 2018, told Buzzfeed that, should President Trump and his administration continue to defy the judge s ruling regarding the Muslim ban stay, House Democrats would be looking at possible impeachment. Senator Dick Durbin echoed Castro s warnings.While Republicans wanted to impeach President Obama for supposedly being a Marxist Muslim, Democrats (and independents alike) want to impeach Trump for violating the Constitution and a federal judge s order.To think, in only two weeks, forty percent of the country is in favor of removing their president from office. Perhaps Republicans should be taking notice. After all, 2018 is right around the corner. And history shows that the more unpopular a president is, the more his party suffers in the midterms.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,3-Feb-17
 WATCH: Fox News Literally Praises Last Jobs Report Under President Obama As Economic Win For Trump,"Fox News insulted President Obama one last time by crediting Donald Trump for the good January jobs report.Every time a positive jobs report was released during President Obama s eight years in office, Fox News found something to criticize and even claimed that the numbers were being faked.They desperately claimed that the economy was terrible under Obama and refused to acknowledge that jobs were being created in this country at a record-breaking pace never seen in this country before.But on Friday, Fox News lavished praise upon Trump and giddily discussed the January jobs report released this week that shows 227,000 new jobs were added to the economy last month.Fox & Friends host Heather Nauert hailed the report as  the first jobs report under President Trump  and called it  fantastic news. Great news on the jobs front this morning,  she added before letting everyone know that this is something Trump can brag about.Here s the video via Media Matters.This is absolutely hypocritical of Fox News. Prior to this report, President Obama oversaw a record 75 consecutive months of job growth in the United States and Fox refused to give Obama credit for this incredible economic achievement. But they are perfectly willing to give Trump all the credit in the world for a single jobs report.And that jobs report is not Trump s achievement. It s President Obama s.Not only is Fox News being hypocritical propagandists as usual, they are totally wrong about it.According to Media Matters,University of Chicago economist Austan Goolsbee, a former chairman of President Obama s Council of Economic Advisors, pointed out that the  reference week  for the latest jobs data ran through January 12, meaning the entire report predates the Trump administration by over a week. Washington Post reporter Glenn Kessler, who runs the paper s fact-checking research, also noted that the report  still reflects the Obama administration.  Fox also neglected to mention that the report marks 76 consecutive months of job growth   the longest on record   for Obama.In short, this jobs report should be credited to President Obama, which means his streak of consecutive job growth now stands at 76 months.Media Matters also pointed out that Fox News whined about an even better jobs report in February 2015 that showed 257,000 jobs were added, much better than the report issued this week. But Fox chose to nitpick by complaining that unemployment had increased by 0.1 percent, which just so happens to be the same percentage increase in this January jobs report Fox is praising as an economic victory for Trump.And that s not all.In October of that year, Fox & Friends stumbled through a news alert in which a host claimed the economy created  only 271,000 jobs   last month  even though that report, like the data released today, also beat expectations. Last January, Fox s spin was to claim that 292,000 new jobs was  modest by historical standards,  though it was well over this month s 227,000. And in April 2016 the network parsed the jobs data to conclude that a report showing 215,000 new jobs was unimpressive because 47,000 of those were allegedly low-quality retail positions   yet Nauert made no such comment about the 46,000 retail jobs included in today s report. As Election Day drew near, Fox & Friends falsely claimed that steady jobs data for October 2016 were  underwhelming  and spun the news as a boon for Trump s presidential candidacy.So Fox News is literally changing the way they cover jobs reports, thus proving that they are Trump s and the Republican Party s propaganda machine. This is what fake news actually looks like.For 76 months, Fox News trashed every positive jobs report to make it look like President Obama was overseeing a weak economy. The fact is, however, that President Obama is one of the strongest economic presidents in our nation s history.Featured image via Myside s Spew",News,3-Feb-17
 Trump Gets Laughed Off Twitter For Claiming That All Protesters Against Him Are Paid Thugs,"Donald Trump is either really desperate to make it sound like everyone loves him or he s totally delusional.Because ever since inauguration day, millions of Americans have been participating in protests against him and his disastrous administration.The Women s March of Washington DC not only dwarfed Trump s inauguration crowd by a landslide, it was joined by people around the globe.And the protests haven t stopped.They continued outside the White House as Trump watched  Finding Dory  while worldwide chaos continued due to his Muslim ban. It s been two weeks since Trump took office and he has already been protested and hated by more people than any other president in history.But Trump took to Twitter on Friday morning to claim that all the protesters are just  thugs  who have been paid to protest him, suggesting that the protesters really love him and are only protesting to make some money.Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

 Arkansas Republicans Pass Bill Giving Rapists The Power To Stop Victims From Getting An Abortion,"A vicious new law in Arkansas proves that Republicans are on the side of rapists.Two months ago, Republicans fast-tracked a brand new anti-abortion bill through the legislature and Governor Asa Hutchinson signed it last week.Arkansas Act 45 bans the most common and safest abortion procedure available to women known as dilation and evacuation, which is used for abortions performed during the second trimester. That means Arkansas Republicans are openly defying the framework set up by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade which says states can t interfere with a woman s right to choose until the fetus becomes viable. 50 percent viability rate is achieved at 24 to 25 weeks. But the new law would ban safe abortions after 14 weeks and creates a burden for women because it forces them to choose less safe options to end their pregnancies.Doctors who perform the abortion procedure would be charged with a felony that carries a $10,000 fine or six years in prison.But the bill also has a terrifying clause that rapists are going to love.The bill gives rapists the power to deny their victims an abortion if they sue the abortion provider.According to The Daily Beast,A clause in the Arkansas law allows a woman s spouse, parent or guardian, or health care provider to sue an abortion provider for civil damages or injunctive relief that could stop the abortion. And because Act 45 does not provide any exceptions for cases of rape or incest, the clause could allow the fetus s father to sue an abortion provider even in cases of spousal rape or incest.Some lawmakers, like Democratic state Senator Will Bond, had a problem with the bill because the way it is drafted seems to allow any family member of the pregnant woman to file a lawsuit to stop the abortion and could actually end up severely disabling women who are forced to choose a riskier abortion procedure. There is an injunctive relief section in the bill that, in my reading of it, would seem to allow litigation among family members. If one spouse sought injunctive relief to prevent a certain procedure, or possibly other family members have the possibility for injunctive relief, that was a concern of mine. There is an exception for women s health in the bill, but it required irreparable harm [to the point of] permanent disability of a woman. The way it was drafted, I had concerns that the women s health exception is way too narrow, and there s no exception for rape and incest. The fact that rapists have a new tool to use to torture their victims is totally unacceptable and demonstrates that Republicans are totally anti-woman.Of course, these kinds of bills have been blocked in other states, so it s likely this one will be blocked from going into effect as well. But women cannot rely on the courts to protects their rights. They need to vote and kick Republicans out of office if they truly want to guarantee that government will not try to dictate what decisions they make about their own bodies.Featured image via Woman Survival",News,3-Feb-17
 Nancy Pelosi Backs BOMBSHELL Legislation That Could Kick Trump Out Of Office (VIDEO),"Donald Trump hasn t even been president for a month, and already Americans (and the world) are extremely concerned about the future of this country. One of those people is Nancy Pelosi, the highest ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, and she delivered a few stunning comments recently in condemnation of Trump s terrifying choice of Steve Bannon for the National Security Council.Bannon is well-known as a white supremacist, and Pelosi wasn t afraid to call him just that. While Republicans have sugar coated and flat-out lied when it comes to Trump s disgraceful behavior and choices, Pelosi pointed out the severity of the situation when she blasted Trump for this reckless decision.Stating that she was in full support of GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz s idea to require presidents to pass a mental evaluation, Pelosi said she  can t wait  until this is actually a reality: What s making America less safe is to have a white supremacist named to the National Security Council as a permanent member while the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Director of National Intelligence are told,  Don t call us, we ll call you. You re no longer permanent members.    It s a stunning thing that a white supremacist, Bannon, would be a permanent member of the National Security Council   You probably are aware of this, but I found it intriguing that House Oversight Committee Chairman [Jason] Chaffetz told the Washington Post that he was weighing legislation that, in essence, says that if you re going to have your hands on the nuclear codes, we should probably know what mental state you re in. I can t wait until he introduces that legislation to be able to join as a cosponsor of that   I think it s a very good idea. We all know that if Trump were required to pass a mental exam, he would be done for. He lacks the temperament, the intelligence and the focus to make logical, sound decisions and he is far more preoccupied with defending his tiny hands and inauguration crowds than improving the country. Pelosi is far from alone in being concerned about Trump s mental state   most of Americans (and many psychologists) agree that he needs an evaluation, ASAP.You can watch Pelosi s remarks below:Featured image via Win McNamee and Pool / Getty Images",News,3-Feb-17

" South Park Creators GIVE UP, Say Donald Trump Is Too Stupid For Their Show To Mock (VIDEO)","The 20th season of South Park was largely centered around Donald Trump s campaign, with the show heavily mocking him at every turn. But there was a problem, according to the show s creators   it just wasn t funny compared to the actual stupid things The Donald (and his administration) does. It s tricky now because satire has become reality,  Parker recently told Australian TV show 7.30, adding that Trump is always eight steps ahead of them in terms of wacky behavior: It s really hard to make fun of and in the last season of South Park, which just ended a month-and-a-half ago, we were really trying to make fun of what was going on but we couldn t keep up and what was actually happening was much funnier than anything we could come up with. Parker says that in future seasons, the intend to  back off and let them do their comedy  while the pair do theirs because Trump is just too hard to mock.In a world where the Trump administration has threatened to invade Mexico, started an international incident with Australia, and even invented a term intended to normalize lies    alternative facts    it s easy to see their point. No matter how hard anyone tries, the Trump team somehow manages to stay one step ahead of comedy.Watch Stone and Parker discuss the difficulty of mocking Trump below:Featured image via screengrab",News,3-Feb-17
 WATCH: Kellyanne Conway Blames Muslim Refugees For Massacre That LITERALLY Never Happened,"Is there some reason that the media feels the need to keep talking to Kellyanne Conway? One would think her time on the news shows was over when she called lies  alternative facts,  but no. It s not, so she s still out there making outrageous claims and talking about things she knows nothing about.Thursday night, she appeared on MSNBC s  Hardball With Chris Matthews,  and, in trying to demonize both the press and Muslim refugees as strongly as possible, she said that two Iraqi refugees were responsible for a massacre here in the U.S.Wait, which massacre did these two Iraqi refugees carry out?Why, the one at Bowling Green, of course.Are you still wondering what massacre she s talking about? You re not alone. The reason the press never covered the Bowling Green massacre is because it never happened. Ever. At the hands of Muslims or other terrorists or anyone.And yet, she said it on national television. While she was talking about President Obama s non-ban on Iraqi refugees coming to the U.S., she literally said: President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized, and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. Her assertion is that most people don t know about it because the press didn t cover it. Seriously. You can t make this up. Watch below:Kellyanne Conway lambastes the media for ignoring the  Bowling Green Massacre,  which doesn t exist (via @joesonka) pic.twitter.com/8AUxX5ZymO  Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) February 3, 2017Okay, so, that s a short clip, and it could easily have been taken out of context.So, for context, here s what happened: Matthews grilled her about executive orders in general, and whether or not it s kosher to be firing government employees who object. He also asked her about federal employees, who swore to uphold and defend the Constitution, and whether they signed a petition. Conway seems to believe that employees ought to put up and shut up, or walk.She said that everyone knew what they were getting with this new administration, but when Matthews brought up whether the president has a right to insist that his employees agree with him. She went into extreme vetting, countries that harbor, train and export terrorism.At that point, she brought up the non-existent Bowling Green massacre, and then spoke about the attacks in Brussels, Paris, and elsewhere in Europe. Then she talks about  looking the other way  with radical Islamic terrorism.In other words, the context doesn t change the fact that she completely fabricated a massacre to justify Trump s Muslim ban. You can watch the full video here.Did she flat-out lie about this, or is she really just that stupid? Vox might have an answer: In 2011, two Iraqi refugees, Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, were arrested in Bowling Green, KY, on federal terrorism charges. Allegedly, they had been plotting to send money and weapons back home to Iraqi insurgents. Someone needs to publicly shame her on the air for bullshit like this: There was no massacre at Bowling Green; there were never any plans for a massacre at Bowling Green or anywhere else courtesy of these two, and there was never a ban on Iraqi refugees because of these two.Vox s Zach Beauchamp says it s possible she was referencing a haunted house called Bowling Green Massacre.Regardless, she made a massive fool of herself last night, along with the administration she works for. We always knew she was ridiculous, but this is just beyond the pale.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,3-Feb-17
 Department Store Chain Drops Ivanka Trump Like A Bad Habit As Daddy F*cks Over Our Country,"Donald Trump s presidency may be going great for him and his best friend Vladimir Putin, but his daughter s bottom line is really taking a pounding from his authoritarian policies. Yes, Daddy s little girl was likely hoping   like the rest of her family   that she would be able to use her father s position to make a lot of money, but things aren t working out quite that way.Nordstrom was recently targeted by the  Grab Your Wallet  campaign, which encourages people to avoid shopping at any stores that do business with the Trumps. Bloomberg reports that the department store chain has elected (like other businesses) to stop selling Ivanka Trump s brand this season based on abysmal sales. Whether this was because every single one of her products, like every member of the Trump family, save Barron, is terrible, or because of the boycotts cannot be said for sure, but in any case, her products have already disappeared from the retailer s online store. Some products will remain on the shelves for now, but they will be gone as well. In this case, based on the brand s performance, we ve decided not to buy it for this season,  the company said in a statement. Grab Your Wallet co-founder Shannon Coulter says she is  thrilled  with Nordstrom s decision to drop Ivanka Trump. Though some Trump supporters are threatening their own boycott if Nordstrom drops Ivanka s sh*tty merchandise, they can t expect much sympathy from the company. In an email to employees, co-president Pete Nordstrom said that the concept of  if people don t buy it, we won t sell it  applies in this situation.Though the company says the decision is sales-driven, it is entirely possible that they just want to distance themselves from Ivanka, who has already attempted to use her father s presidency to push her products. Her company sent a  style alert  to journalists Monday promoting a bracelet that Ivanka wore during an interview with  60 Minutes  about her father   a clear sign that the Trumps know nothing about avoiding conflicts of interest:As Donald Trump continues to threaten to send troops to Mexico, f*ck up diplomatic relationships with countries that have been our strongest allies since World War I, waste our tax dollars on his stupid wall, and attempt to discriminate against an entire religion solely based on his own bigotry, we can expect his daughter s brand to continue to suffer   as well it should.Featured image via Boston Globe",News,3-Feb-17
 Hawaii Republicans Punish Female Party Leader For Criticizing Trump At Women’s March,"Republicans in Hawaii punished the first female House Minority Leader for putting country before party.Prior to and after the election, state Rep. Beth Fukumoto took a stand against Donald Trump. She criticized him for his treatment of women and minorities and refused to blindly follow Trump.Criticism is a form of free speech, but Fukumoto is now being punished for exercising her constitutional rights by her own party.Fukumoto served as the House Minority Leader of the Republican Party in the state legislature, but no longer holds that position after her party punished her for criticizing Trump at the Women s March last month. They told me they would keep me in this position if I would commit to not disagreeing with our president for the remainder of his term,  Fukumoto explained during a speech on the House floor.  Mr. Speaker, I m being removed because I refused to make that commitment, because I believe it s our job as Americans and as leaders in this body to criticize power when power is wrong. Indeed, dissent is an American value, especially when the president is acting like petulant child tyrant.Fukumoto was told by a Republican colleague that as House Minority Leader, her first duty should be to the party. You are speaking not for yourself anymore,  Rep. Bob McDermott responded.  It is a high-level responsibility. And he is totally wrong.The first duty of any American in public office is to the country and the people, not the interests of the party. Putting party and power first is selfish and blinds lawmakers to seeing what is best for the nation.McDermott repeatedly argued with other Republican women in the state legislature and Fukumoto was replaced as House Minority Leader by a male lawmaker.Fukumoto told KHON that she expressed her concerns about Trump during the Women s March the day after the inauguration. The Republican Party is getting increasingly hostile to different opinions. If you followed what happened at the state convention, I got booed for about 10 minutes straight for raising concerns about President Trump, then nominee Trump, and the way he treated women and minorities in many of his remarks. I, at the time, had said this is not, this should not reflect our party I repeated those sentiments at the Women s March last week.And since then, there have been many calls for my resignation, and my caucus members have raised concerns about whether or not that means I m a Republican, whether or not that means I m fit for leadership, whether or not that means I should even be an elected official. My caucus has asked me to stop speaking out about Trump and to make a commitment. They ve said they ll keep me as minority leader if I make a commitment not to speak out against Trump for the remainder of his term. I don t think that s our job as elected officials, even more so, I don t think that s our job as citizens. So Fukumoto is now reaching out to her constituents asking them if they would be okay with her joining the Democratic Party.Here s the video via KHON.Fukumoto should not have been punished for criticizing Donald Trump. But Republicans increasingly believe that anyone who criticizes them and their policies should be punished, the Constitution be damned.The fact that Republicans replaced Fukumoto with a man speaks volumes about how much Republicans value women and it s an insult that should be answered with protests and a landslide victory for Democrats at the ballot box for generations until Republican learn to respect women, the country, and the Constitution that they claim to hold so dear.Featured Image: YouTube",News,2-Feb-17
 The Best Way To Get Rid Of ‘President Steve Bannon’ Is With Articles Like This,"Donald Trump was once a Democrat, but that s no more. Donald Trump was once pro-choice, but not now. Donald Trump didn t used to hate LGBT people but that was before he ran as a Republican. There is one enduring trait that has remained consistent for as long as America has known Donald Trump, though: he is a narcissist. When his ego and his vanity are threatened, he does something about it.Despite this, on Saturday, Trump promoted senior advisor, former Breitbart head and neo-nazi, Steve Bannan to head the National Security Council, making him arguably the most powerful man in Washington. Many are now calling Bannon the  de facto president  and the actual president:But a new executive order, politicizing the process for national security decisions, suggests Mr. Bannon is positioning himself not merely as a Svengali but as the de facto president.In that new order, issued on Saturday, Mr. Trump took the unprecedented step of naming Mr. Bannon to the National Security Council, along with the secretaries of state and defense and certain other top officials. President George W. Bush s last chief of staff, Joshua Bolten, was so concerned about separating politics from national security that he barred Mr. Rove, Mr. Bush s political adviser, from N.S.C. meetings. To the annoyance of experienced foreign policy aides, David Axelrod, President Barack Obama s political adviser, sat in on some N.S.C. meetings, but he was not a permanent member of the council.Source: New York TimesThe New York Times wasn t the only paper saying that Steve Bannon was now the most powerful man in the country:GQ magazine carried an article that states,  In Case It Wasn t Clear Yet, Steve Bannon Is Our President. Politico ran with  The man behind Trump? Still Steve Bannon.  And Foreign Policy writes about  President Bannon s Hugely Destructive First Week in Office. This is a good thing. Trump wears his Achilles heel on his poorly tailored sleeve. It s hard to imagine that he s the great deal maker he claims when it s so clear that he can be led by no more than his ego. You stroke Trump s ego, you re solid, you threaten it, you re the enemy. He s fired people who disagree with him. He hung up on the Prime Minister of Australia   Australia. Since the election, Trump has bragged about his electoral victory, calling it a landslide. It wasn t. He s battled back and forth over the obvious fact that his inauguration was an attendance disaster.If we want to get rid of the neo-nazi that s secretly running the White House, it s actually pretty easy. We need to keep writing and sharing articles like this. Our biggest weapon against Trump is to appeal to his ego. Trump can t even resist obsessing about an unflattering Saturday Night Live parody   something that every president since Gerald Ford has had to endure. There s no way in hell he will put up with being demoted to second in charge in Washington, so we need to keep telling him that that s exactly what he is.

 Republicans Are Frantically Trying To Fix Trump’s Foreign Relations Disaster With Australia,"Republicans are desperately trying to fix Donald Trump s latest foreign affairs trainwreck. On Saturday, Trump actually hung up on the prime minister of Australia after a heated phone call. Now, GOP senators are left to clean up the mess he has made with one of our oldest and closest allies.The call between Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was scheduled to last an hour, but after about 25 minutes Trump declared that their conversation had been  the worst call by far  and hung up the phone. As details of the call began to make headlines, Trump threw another tantrum and sent out this tweet:Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017Sen. John McCain released a statement on Thursday which said he had called Ambassador Joe Hockey and tried to smooth things over. I called Australia s Ambassador to the United States this morning to express my unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance,  McCainsaid.McCain said that he asked Hockey to convey to the people of Australia  that Americans honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote. In his statement, McCain noted that the U.S. and Australia have fought on the same side since World War I. He added that the countries  alliance is  more important than ever  right now. In short, Australia is one of America s oldest friends and staunchest allies. We are united by ties of family and friendship, mutual interests and common values, and shared sacrifice in wartime,  he said.Sen. Bob Corker said he has also contacted Australia s ambassador to echo McCains words. Corker, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke to Hockey on Thursday and stressed the importance of the alliance between the U.S. and Australia. Just got off the phone with Ambassador @JoeHockey. We discussed the important and long-lasting alliance between our two countries.

 Poll: Majority Of Americans HATE Trump’s Unconstitutional Executive Orders,"While President Trump s approval rating continues to fall to embarrassing ans unprecedented levels, new polling has come out that shows dismal numbers of support towards his hateful, unconstitutional executive orders.According to Gallup Polling, the majority of the American public has an unfavorable view towards Trump s most controversial orders, including the ban on immigration refuge from seven majority-Muslim countries.Here s what the poll found:The poll also found that President Trump s approval rating 43% while his disapproval rating stands at 52 percent, a net negative 9 points. Only 41 percent of independent voters approve of Trump s performance as president, along with 83 percent of Republicans.Almost half of America believes Trump is acting  too fast  in his first days in office.Simply put: Trump is (still) hated by the American public and so are his most controversial executive actions. The only people that seem to like him are the Republicans that voted him in. Still, over one-sixth of the GOP doesn t seem to like him at this point.As Gallup s analysis concludes:Trump is not enjoying the type of honeymoon that the American public accorded his predecessors in their first weeks in office. Trump s initial job approval rating was the lowest in Gallup history, and a majority of Americans continue to disapprove of the job he is doing. No other president going back to Dwight Eisenhower had majority disapproval in his first several months in office. A majority of Americans, in similar fashion, disapprove of several of the high-visibility executive actions Trump has taken within his first 10 days in the White House.This polarization of opinion most likely reflects not only Trump himself   his style and the actions he has taken   but also the prevailing political environment today.The only thing Trump cares about is how people feel about him. His numbers aren t getting better, and they have   for the better part of two years   been embarrassingly low (in the mid forties).Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,2-Feb-17
" Trump F**ks Up His First Raid, Gets Navy Seal KILLED For the DUMBEST Reason (DETAILS)","Donald Trump already has blood on his hands. Over the weekend, Trump ordered his first raid and somehow managed to completely f**k up what was supposed to be a very straightforward operation. Thanks to his carelessness and trigger-happy nature, Trump got a Navy SEAL killed.The raid was on al Qaeda in Yemen, and Trump decided to go through with the raid even though he did not have sufficient intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations.  Because of Trump s literal lack of intelligence, U.S. Navy SEAL William  Ryan  Owens was killed, as well as many other non-combatant civilian deaths. According to Reuters, about 30 people, including 10 women and children, were killed.  And of course, Trump managed to screw things up so badly that no militants or prisoners were taken in during this process.As more details came in about this mess of an operation, it was discovered that Trump decided to go ahead with the raid without even doing the most minimal preparations. It was reported: U.S. military officials told Reuters that Trump approved his first covert counterterrorism operation without sufficient intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations. As a result, three officials said, the attacking SEAL team found itself dropping onto a reinforced al Qaeda base defended by landmines, snipers, and a larger than expected contingent of heavily armed Islamist extremists. And as expected, guess who Trump and his team are blaming for this? Former President Barack Obama. According to a White House official, the Obama administration had signed off on the raid last month, but delayed it for  operational reasons.  An official said: The decision was made   to leave it to the incoming administration, partly in the hope that more and better intelligence could be collected. But of course, Trump and his team didn t bother to collect more information before proceeding, especially since Trump truly believes that he is  like, a smart person.  Unfortunately, he s not smart enough to know he should gather current information before pressing green on a raid.Trump now has the blood of a U.S. Navy SEAL on his hands, but don t expect him to take accountability for it. This could have been avoided and should have ever happened. Unfortunately, it will probably happen again because Trump and his team are too incompetent to learn from their mistakes.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,2-Feb-17
 Trump’s Gonna HATE This New Poll: More Americans Want Obama Back Than Want Him Now (DETAILS),"In what will surely send Donald Trump into a new Twitter tirade, a new poll from Public Policy Polling (PPP) shows the majority Americans longing to have President Obama back, and overwhelmingly not liking Trump.According to the poll: Less than 2 weeks into Donald Trump s tenure as President, 40% of voters already want to impeach him. That s up from 35% of voters who wanted to impeach him a week ago. Only 48% of voters say that they would be opposed to Trump s impeachment.Beyond a significant percentage of voters already thinking that Trump should be removed from office, it hasn t taken long for voters to miss the good old days of Barack Obama 52% say they d rather Obama was President, to only 43% who are glad Trump is. President Obama was loved by the United States, and for as many haters as there were, there were far more that loved and appreciated his true leadership and love of country over himself. The same can t be said of Trump.Check out this tweet that garnered over 1.6 million likes:It's been the honor of my life to serve you. You made me a better leader and a better man.  President Obama (@POTUS44) January 20, 2017And then this one:I won't stop; I'll be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by your voices of truth and justice, good humor, and love.  President Obama (@POTUS44) January 20, 2017The man isn t only loved, he s beloved.Trump, on the other hand, throws out mean revenge tweets like their going out of style. And most of the responses to his tweets are condemning his actions. To be blunt   the man is not liked much at all. Sure, he has he band of merry minions who would likely drink paint if Trump told them to, but he lost the popular vote by 3 million vote to Hillary Clinton. And the only reason he is president is due to an archaic Electoral College that was devised to give power to slave owners who counted their slaves as 3/5 of a person, and help those in rural communities have a voice. It s no longer needed and the nation doesn t want Trump nor his backhanded style of egomaniacal leadership.It seems, if given the opportunity, the United States would have President Obama back in a heartbeat. If only that were possible.Featured Photo by Alex Wong, Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,2-Feb-17
 WATCH: Congressman Invokes Impeachment Power On House Floor In Response To Trump’s Muslim Ban,"Donald Trump s executive order barring people from entering the United States from seven countries in the Middle East exposed his violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.And a House Democrat took him to task for it on Thursday during a speech on the House floor.When Trump signed the executive order last Friday, he targeted people traveling for nations that are not responsible for any deaths of American citizens on American soil, despite claiming that his order is meant to protect Americans from terrorists.Trump even invoked 9/11 to justify the order, but left countries off the list where many of the hijackers came from, such as Saudi Arabia, which also helped fund them and their operation.The nations Trump conveniently left off the list also have something else in common. They all have business ties with the Trump Organization.In other words, Trump is a complete hypocrite and is making foreign policy decisions based on whether they will hurt his family s business or not.And Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan absolutely hammered Trump for it on the House floor with a devastating speech. These countries were excluded from the executive order despite being home to many of the terrorists who carried out 9/11,  Pocan pointed out.  I m not saying we should ban people from these countries. I firmly oppose any ban based on nationality or religion. But it is unacceptable that business interests have played potentially a role in such a destructive policy, a policy that also makes our country less safe in the long run. Pocan explained that Trump s business interests in the countries left off the list influenced his decision to not include them even though Trump repeatedly declared that he would make America safe by blocking nations where terrorists come from to attack us. Trump clearly believes that maintaining his business interests are more important than banning travel from Saudi Arabia, the country where most of the 9/11 attackers were from and received their funding. It s time for the president to stop defending his divisive and unconstitutional executive order and start being transparent about his business interests,  Pocan said.  Every president in the modern era has released tax records to ensure the American people that their actions will not be impacted by financial holdings. Indeed, Richard Nixon was the first president to release his tax records to the public, and that set a precedent that all presidential candidates have followed over the decades. Trump broke that precedent and refused to release his taxes because he is hiding his numerous business connections with nations like Russia that would expose him and his treachery to the American people. Trump now says he won t release his taxes at all despite promising that he would do so after an audit is completed, even though an audit does not prevent someone from releasing their tax records.Pocan then demanded that Trump release his taxes, divest himself from his company, and repeal his executive order or else face legislative action, including the possibility of impeachment. Mr. President, it s time for you to fix this. One, divest your business holding immediately to remove any suggestion of conflicts in your decision making. Two, show us your tax returns so financial interests are transparent to the American people. And three, get rid of your unconstitutional executive order, which will make us less safe and only serve to embolden our enemies. Short of that, we ll have to take other actions, including legislative directives, resolutions of disapproval and even explore the power of impeachment. The Speaker then whined about Pocan threatening impeachment as if Republicans hadn t been calling for impeaching President Obama over the last eight years.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is a liar and a traitor who is putting his business interests ahead of the best interests of the American people. Not only should he be impeached, his entire administration should be removed. And Democrats could get the chance to do exactly that if Americans vote in 2018 to take the House away from the Republican majority.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,2-Feb-17
 Canada’s Trudeau Throws MAJOR Shade At ‘Grizzly Bear’ Trump; It’s GLORIOUS,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is a diplomatic, nice guy   unlike his American counterpart, Donald Trump. While speaking on the issue of how to deal with Trump, Trudeau was able to show class and grace, while still throwing major shade at the bombastic, bumbling American president. Trudeau s low-key handling of Trump could cost him with his progressive base at home, but given Trump s penchant for retaliation, going after Trump explicitly could be harmful to Canada s economy, given the fact that they export so many products to our country.While speaking on Trump, Trudeau said: Why poke a grizzly bear while it s having lunch? Trump has just got into office and he is formulating his economic plans. This is clearly a departure from the closeness Trudeau had with President Obama. Their adorable bromance and open and affectionate friendship is surely something that will not be duplicated with Trump. Those familiar with the situation on how Trudeau may handle Trump acknowledge that no one quite knows what to do with him at this point. One source said: He is totally unpredictable. Of course, this isn t the first time Trudeau has thrown passive aggressive public punches at Trump. After Trump s Muslim ban threw the nation and world into chaos, Trudeau tweeted:To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada  Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 28, 2017Of course, Trudeau s reluctance to go after Trump may not last long. He is up for re-election in 2019, and will have to continue to tout his commitment to diversity and inclusion in the fact of Trump s crude nationalism and open bigotry. However, Canadian Pollster Nik Nanos says Trudeau is doing the right thing regarding Trump for now: He has to avoid making any kind of criticism. Trump has a very thin skin and he s quick to lash out. That may be, but given Trudeau s public statements regarding diversity and progressive values, he is not likely to hold off for long before he takes the gloves off regarding Trump. We ll be lucky if America has ANY friends left by the end of Trump s term.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,2-Feb-17
 Newly Leaked Executive Order Will Turn A FRIGHTENING Number Of Christian ‘Morals’ Into Law,"It seems the Trump administration will stop at nothing to codify the religious-right s insanely narrow beliefs into law. After backing off an earlier executive order that would have legalized all manner of discrimination against LGBTQ individuals, it appears there s a draft of a new order out that s far broader, and far scarier.A copy of the draft order was obtained by The Nation and other outlets, and would do the following: The draft order seeks to create wholesale exemptions for people and organizations who claim religious or moral objections to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity, and it seeks to curtail women s access to contraception and abortion through the Affordable Care Act. The order refrains from specifically mentioning Christianity, and the administration no doubt thinks that makes it Constitutional. Under this order,  religious exercise  applies to  any act or refusal to act that is motivated by a sincerely held religious belief, whether or not the act is required by, or central to, a system of religious belief. As such, it would prohibit the government from denying tax-exempt status, or financially punishing, religious organizations that are involved in politics.That, in turn, makes it clear that it would reward people who discriminate against LGBTQ individuals, oppress and control women, and even reward people who seek to stop things like comprehensive sex-ed because it supposedly encourages pre-marital sex, and more, just because of their religious beliefs.It could even open the floodgates for so-called  gay conversion therapy,  despite its dangers, and despite its being condemned by every medical and psychological organization out there.But wait! That s not all. This order requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to exempt anyone who objects even to preventive medical care on religious grounds. It does not specify what types of preventive care, but it s not hard to see that they re targeting women s healthcare here, including hormonal birth control, as well as vaccines.The preventive care mandate within the ACA actually has a separate section for women s care, including screening for STDs, breast cancer, UTIs, HPV and cervical cancer, as well as well-woman visits (which covers pap smears and other routine exams).The mandate also requires health insurers to cover vaccines for children from birth to age 18, as well as cervical dysplasia screenings for sexually active adolescent girls, and HIV screenings for sexually active adolescents.Should the preventive care mandate go away, the ones who will be hurt the worst will be women and girls, and that s intentional since the religious right is all about controlling women and their behavior.According to The Nation s story, a professor at Georgetown University s Law Center, and expert on church-state separation and religious freedom, says: This executive order would appear to require agencies to provide extensive exemptions from a staggering number of federal laws without regard to whether such laws substantially burden religious exercise. Moreover, the exemptions would raise serious First Amendment questions, as well, because they would go far beyond what the Supreme Court has identified as the limits of permissive religious accommodations. He would be extremely surprised if the Office of Legal Counsel were to certify this order in part because it greatly expands the definition of  religious exercise  to mean anything for anyone, it seems.Perhaps worst of all is that it would cover federal employees, which could lead to discrimination including denying people care at the VA or denying them Social Security benefits, simply because they have a stated  sincerely held  belief against enabling whatever.If this order is signed, LGBTQ individuals will be subject to hideous discrimination, women will lose access to preventive care and birth control, and without court intervention, it will likely lead to making Christianity the law of the land. Trump and his administration are way out of control with unconstitutional executive orders.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,2-Feb-17
 Virginia Seeks To Hold Trump In Contempt For Ignoring Federal Court Order Against Muslim Ban,"Donald Trump could end up behind bars if the state of Virginia holds him in contempt of court for violating a federal court order that halted parts of his Muslim ban.Last Friday, Trump signed an unconstitutional executive order banning people from seven countries from entering the United States. Worldwide chaos and mass protests ensued throughout the weekend as Custom s officials and airport security detained and deported people traveling from those nations, even going so far as to detain American citizens who have green cards and separating children from their parents.Multiple states and the ACLU immediately filed lawsuits against the order and attorneys rushed to defend the rights of those being detained.And then New York federal Judge Ann M. Donnelly issued a stay that was supposed to immediately halt the actions of Custom s officials and airport security.Shortly after that, a federal court in Virginia issued a temporary restraining order to force Customs agents to let lawyers talk to legal United States residents who were being detained.But Customs officials ignored the order in directly defied the court ruling, and now the state of Virginia is pursuing charges against Trump for it.A motion has been filed requesting  the issuance of a rule to show cause why respondents should not be held in contempt of this Court s temporary restraining order (TRO) entered on the evening of January 28, 2017.  Donald Trump is specifically named in the motion along with the Department of Homeland Security and several Customs officials.United States Congressman Donald Beyer filed a declaration under penalty of perjury that he personally witnessed Customs agents ignore the federal court order and said that police at Dulles International Airport blocked him and two of his colleagues from speaking to the Customs official in charge because they were ordered to not let anyone have access to them. Senator Cory Booker also filed a declaration in support of the motion.Now a hearing will be held to determine if Trump ordered the Customs agents at Dulles to ignore the court order, and if he did, he will likely be charged with contempt of court, which carries a possible jail sentence.Homeland Security even admitted that it was ignoring the court order to continue enforcing Trump s executive order.The Department of Homeland Security will continue to enforce all of President Trump s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. President Trump s Executive Orders remain in place prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. President Trump s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America s borders and national security.The fact that Customs agents willfully ignored a federal court to continue carrying out Trump s tyrannical order is absolutely frightening. The question is, did Homeland Security willfully ignore the court order by itself, or did Trump order them to ignore it and his order was passed down the chain of command to the Customs officials? If the order can be traced to Trump, he is in violation of a court order and should be punished for it. And if that means prison time, then so be it. Because unlike the presidency, Trump is totally qualified to be a prison inmate.Featured image via Capitol Hill Blue",News,2-Feb-17
" Trump Just Loosened Sanctions Against Russian Spy Agencies, Americans Are F*cking FURIOUS (TWEETS)","You know how everyone suspected that there would be some quid pro quo for all the help Vladimir Putin gave Donald Trump during the election? Well, it s happening.On Thursday, Donald Trump lifted sanctions imposed by President Obama that prevented Putin from cyberspying. The sanctions were a response to Putin s team of hackers doing Trump a series of favors by hacking his political opponents and releasing any and all information they could that could assist him in becoming President. Reuters reports:The Treasury Department said in a statement it would allow U.S. companies to make limited transactions with the intelligence service that are needed to gain approval to import information technology products into Russia.The broader significance of the sanctions exemptions were not immediately clear. The Treasury Department often issues general licenses such as the one announced on Thursday to help U.S. companies overcome unintended business consequences of sanctions.U.S. intelligence agencies accused the FSB of involvement in hacking of Democratic organizations during the election, won by Republican Donald Trump.The agencies and private cyber security experts concluded the FSB first broke into the Democratic National Committee s computer system in the summer of 2015 and began monitoring email and chat conversations.They say FSB was one of two Russian spy agencies believed to have been involved in a wide-ranging operation by top-ranking individuals in Russia s government to discredit Democrat Hillary Clinton and help Trump win the election.When Obama imposed the sanctions, Vladimir Putin announced that he would wait to respond until after Trump became President because he expected a response that favors him. This move was just the first of many we can expect to benefit Vladimir Putin. This is the same group (FSB) that, just a month ago, our intelligence community determined was responsible for the attack on our democracy,  Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., ranking member of a House CIA subcommittee, said in response to Trump  rewarding  Putin for his help during the election.  We just made it easier for the same group to import into Russia the tools they could use to hack us or our allies again. Naturally, Americans are not happy with this new development:Riddle me this Batman, how is lifting sanctions against Russia not a change in policy?

 Foreign Policy Insider: Trump Turned Off Recording During His Phone Call With Vladimir Putin,"On Thursday, Donald Trump eased sanctions against Russia s spy agencies following a phone call last week with brutal Russian dictator and Trumpfriend Vladimir Putin. Details of the call have been scarce, limited to a vague, one-paragraph statement posted on the White House website:President Donald J. Trump received a congratulatory call today from Russian President Vladimir Putin. The call lasted approximately one hour and ranged in topics from mutual cooperation in defeating ISIS to efforts in working together to achieve more peace throughout the world including Syria. The positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair. Both President Trump and President Putin are hopeful that after today s call the two sides can move quickly to tackle terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern.Many have been wondering why information about the specifics of the call has been so scarce. According to Ian Berman, vice president of the conservative-leaning American Foreign Policy Council, the reason is simple   Trump turned off the recording. On Wednesday, Bergman said at a forum on Russian-Turkish relations at the Bipartisan Policy Center that  there was no readout of the Trump-Putin call because [the] White House turned off recording. .@ilanberman: ""there was no readout of the Trump-Putin call bc WH turned off recording""   Kremlin readout is very positive @BPC_Bipartisan pic.twitter.com/oi4v1R5dN0  ilhan tanir (@WashingtonPoint) February 1, 2017The Kremlin s clearly sanitized readout sounds very nice, if one ignored the fact that multiple intelligence agencies have confirmed that Putin personally spearheaded a massive hacking and propaganda campaign on Trump s behalf or that he began receiving his quid pro quo when The Donald eased sanctions against his spy agencies. According to a statement on the Kremlin s website,  both sides expressed their readiness to make active joint efforts to stabilise and develop Russia-US cooperation on a constructive, equitable and mutually beneficial basis  and  The sides stressed the importance of rebuilding mutually beneficial trade and economic ties between the two counties  business communities, which could give an additional impetus to progressive and sustainable development of bilateral relations. In other words, Putin and Trump talked about how our own fascist dictator intends to repay Russia s leader for his help in securing the Oval Office.While it is yet unconfirmed that the recording does not exist, it seems this is the case given the vague readout and the clear attempt to keep information from Americans. If he did indeed shut off recording, why would he do that? There is only one answer   plenty was said that would be uncomfortable if the American people learned the details.We as Americans need to demand a full release of every call Trump has had with world leaders. We need to demand answers   because we will not get them otherwise.Featured image via Getty Images/Win McNamee",News,2-Feb-17
 Robert Reich Makes STUNNING Anti-Trump Statement In BRUTAL Apology To The World (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is successfully ruining all of our relationships with other countries, and cutting ties with some of our most valuable allies.Just yesterday, Trump put America in a terrible position with Australia after speaking with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Basically, he hung up on Turnbull after bragging about his election win and condemned the Prime Minister for a refugee acceptance deal Australia had made with the U.S. during former President Barack Obama s presidency. Trump had even told Turnbull that compared to the other calls he d had with world leaders,  this was the worst call by far.  To make matters worse, Trump tweeted this right after ending the call: Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! Having sabotaged America s relations with Australia and many other countries, Trump is severely compromising the safety and future of America   and we should have seen this coming, considering his extremely disrespectful treatment of China during his transition phase. The only country Trump manages to get along with is of course Vladimir Putin s Russia.In response to Trump s reckless, clumsy handling of world relations, renowned political commentator Robert Reich released a statement on Facebook that truly reflects where America is at this moment in time. Americans are terrified and filled with despair over what Trump is doing, and other countries are being affected as well. In his post, Reich apologized profusely for the disastrous events that have happened under Trump. Reich wrote: A short note to our friends in Australia, Europe, Canada, South Korea, New Zealand, Japan, and elsewhere: We know we have a problem. He shouldn t be in the White House. He doesn t have a mandate for what he s doing. His views don t represent the views of most of us. He lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. Russian operatives may well have got him elected.Please know, we re doing everything we can. This post has gone viral and is being shared widely, as the majority of Americans are just as disappointed as Reich and would give anything to go back to better times. Hopefully, the rest of the world will ignore Trump and take pity on the innocent Americans who want nothing to do with his disgusting policies.Featured image via Scott Olson / Getty Images",News,2-Feb-17
 WATCH: Kellyanne Conway Throws Hissy Fit Over Democrats Blocking Trump’s Nominees,"Donald Trump s screaming banshee Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News to whine about Democrats on Thursday morning and failed to recognize the hypocrisy.Throughout 2016, Senate Republicans blocked President Obama s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court despite the fact that Garland was a qualified judge who previously received praise and support from the GOP. Garland is considered a moderate jurist who would have sat at the ideological center of the high court.In a completely unprecedented move, Republicans refused to even give Garland a confirmation hearing and left the Supreme Court one member short on the bench out of petty hatred of President Obama.On Tuesday, Donald Trump chose conservative judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. In response, Democrats have vowed to retaliate against Republicans by blocking Trump s nominee. Republicans, however, are now whining because Democrats are treating Trump s nominee the same way Republicans treated Obama s.Mitch McConnell has repeatedly complained about Democratic obstruction of Trump s nominees, conveniently ignoring his own party s obstruction of President Obama for eight years. Obstruction that he personally ordered.And now Kellyanne Conway is whining about Democratic obstruction as well.During an appearance on Fox & Friends, Conway called Democrats  a bunch of crybabies who say they are going to oppose Supreme Court nominees before they even know the person s name and his academic credentials and impeccable judicial record. That sounds a whole lot like what Republicans did last February while Justice Scalia s dead body wasn t even cold yet. Obama picked Garland a few months later and his academic credentials and judicial record were even more impressive than Gorsuch s. This obstinance and obstruction is the modern Democratic Party,  Conway cntinued, again failing to recognize the hypocrisy of her claims.  I think it s going to cost them because they re hysterical about everything now. There s no gradation of hysteria, everything makes them cry and scream. Here s the video via YouTube.Seriously, do Republicans really think the American people are stupid? For nearly an entire year, Republicans acted like petulant children by refusing to even grant Garland a hearing, yet they are bitching about Democrats for blocking Trump s nominee.Republicans are hypocrites and they only have themselves to blame for creating a new precedent when it comes to Supreme Court picks. They were the ones who blocked President Obama s rightful pick for a year. They literally stole a Supreme Court seat from President Obama, who was the legally elected sitting president at the time. And it should be pointed out that President Obama s election victories were bigger than Trump s by a wide margin. Until Republicans give Garland the fair hearing he deserves, Democrats should block Trump s nominees indefinitely. It s nothing less than what Republicans deserve. They started it. Now they get to reap what they sowed. Turnabout is fair play.Featured image via screenshot",News,2-Feb-17
" Trump Uses Prayer Breakfast To Mock Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gets HUMILIATED In 14 Priceless Seconds","Donald Trump literally used the National Prayer Breakfast to brag about the low ratings of the new  Celebrity Apprentice  hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger. They hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place, and we know how that turned out,  Trump said on Thursday morning in the middle of the event.  The ratings went right down the tubes, it s been a total disaster  and I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings. Seriously!? How can anybody who calls themselves a Christian support Trump after this? He actually used the prayer breakfast to attack a television show and bully the new host. And this is a television show that Trump is credited as an executive producer.Of all the things that he could have focused on at the breakfast, like homelessness, hunger, peace, or even the dead Navy Seal and eight-year-old girl who were killed during a military raid he ordered over the weekend, he chose to brag about the ratings of his former reality show and asked everyone to pray for it.But Arnold Schwarzenegger soon issued a response to Trump on Twitter in the form of a video message that is sure to have Trump fuming for the rest of the day. Hey, Donald, I have a great idea,  he said.  Why don t we switch jobs? You take over TV   because you re such an expert in ratings   and I take over your job so then people can finally sleep comfortably again? The National Prayer Breakfast? pic.twitter.com/KYUqEZbJIE  Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) February 2, 2017Indeed, if Trump is so concerned about the ratings of his former show, he should resign and go host it again while Schwarzenegger, who actually has governing experience, takes over the presidency.A representative for Schwarzenegger also delivered this burn. Arnold is praying that President Trump can improve his own approval ratings, which were the worst in history of any incoming president, by taking his job seriously and working inclusively. Donald Trump is an embarrassment and disgrace to this country. He is totally unqualified to be president and he should be tossed out on his ass in favor of someone like Schwarzenegger. Any so-called  Christian  who voted for Trump should be ashamed of themselves.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",News,2-Feb-17
 State Department Delivers Largest Dissent Document EVER In Protest Of Trump’s Muslim Ban,"The State Department has a special cable designed so that employees can formally protest a policy, and this one is the largest ever.Over the weekend, chaos swept the nation and the globe after Donald Trump signed an unconstitutional executive order banning travelers from seven countries from entering the United States, even if they have green cards. Leaders around the world condemned the action and massive protests occurred.After acting Attorney General Sally Yates was fired for refusing to defend the unconstitutional order, Trump and his team said that anyone who disagrees with Trump s policy should quit their jobs.That didn t sit very well with many State Department employees, who proceeded to use the special cable to voice their dissent against Trump s policy.According to the Wall Street Journal,People familiar with the  dissent cable  said the document had approximately 1,000 signatures. The State Department maintains a special dissent channel as a formal and confidential vehicle for officials to express alternative views.The cable is the largest such protest ever, said Hannah Gurman, a professor at New York University who wrote a book about dissent at the State Department. Ms. Gurman said the second largest, relating to Syria, was one signed by 51 State Department officials last June.That s right. The State Department protest of Trump s ban is the largest ever recorded and literally dwarfed the protest against one of President Obama s policies last year.This is a pretty big deal and shows just how unpopular Trump is at the State Department.Clearly, a large percentage of the 25,000 employees at the State Department do not like what Trump is doing.And they have every reason to be opposed to Trump.Trump has been making a mockery of diplomacy and our foreign policy long before the election in November. And ever since that day Trump has been making a mess by overturning decades of policy that created stability and security and built alliances.Trump is threatening our allies and moving our nation to the brink of World War III. He is abandoning American values in favor of fear and hate. And Russia s influence over the State Department makes things even more dangerous.Our country faces a threat unlike any we have ever faced before. This threat is from within and he is sitting in the White House. Every employee at the State Department and every citizen in this nation should be horrified by what Trump is doing. And we need to do something about it before he destroys everything we hold dear.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,2-Feb-17
 Trump Threatens Public University Because Protesters Didn’t Let A Racist Bully Deliver His Hate Speech,"Donald Trump is getting thrashed on the Internet right now for threatening a public university.Milo Yiannopoulos was going to speak at the University of California-Berkeley on Wednesday but the school chose to cancel the event after massive protests broke out on campus against the speech.Yiannopoulos is a racist right-wing bully who hates strong women. He is associated with the  Alt-Right  movement that includes white nationalists, Nazis, and white supremacists.As the Southern Poverty Law Center notes,The fact that Yiannopoulos has been photographed wearing a necklace with the German Iron Cross symbol, illustrates the diversity of opinion within the Alt-Right world. But, at the end of the day, neo-Nazis like Anglin, coat-and-tie racists like Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor, and oddball figures like Yiannopoulos have more in common, in terms of sharing a vision of society as fundamentally determined by race, than they disagree about.The protests against Yiannopoulos forced U.C. Berkeley to cancel the speech. And Donald Trump is furious about it.If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view   NO FEDERAL FUNDS?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017That s right, Trump literally just threatened to punish a public university for not letting a racist deliver a speech due to mass protests by students.It s a pathetic and unprecedented attack that Twitter users did not appreciate.@realDonaldTrump U don t see the hypocrisy in ur statement? Free speech IS peaceful protesting. Stop trying to be a dictator.  Kyle McMahon (@KMacMusic) February 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Don t you try and ban free speech at WH press conferences?

He literally encouraged violence at his rallies but now he is all of a sudden angry about violence at a protest?1,500 people showed up to peacefully protest Yiannopoulos. It only got violent after  150 masked agitators  from an anarchist groups showed up and started attacking people and destroying property.One can hardly blame the university for something that was out of their control.Trump is also a hypocrite for whining in defense of free speech even though he has been attacking the free press and anyone who criticizes him. Also, hate speech is not free speech. And hate speech is what Yiannopoulos peddles.Once again, Donald Trump proves that he is out of his depth and is completely unqualified to be president.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,2-Feb-17
 Democrats Launch Plan To Make Trump’s First Speech To Congress VERY Uncomfortable,"Alleged president Donald Trump has literally mocked every group of U.S. citizens during his godawful campaign and it s payback time. Karma is a thing and house Democrats are making sure that the fake president will have to face the very people he mocked in 2016. Trump s first speech to Congress will be very uncomfortable for him because Democrats have launched a plot to invite guests they say will suffer under new White House policies.Democrats are inviting a crowd which includes ethnic minorities, LGBT people, undocumented immigrants, the disabled and others when he addresses a joint session on Feb. 28th, according to The Hill.This time, Democrats are not going to boycott Trump s speech as they did his inauguration, but instead, they will force the man-baby POTUS to face off with the very people who feel alienated and targeted by his controversial executive orders.A letter which is circulating on Capitol Hill urges fellow Democrats to bring guests who have made  a positive impact  on the community  despite discrimination or marginalization. It is our hope that their presence in the House Gallery will remind President Trump that he is not the arbiter of patriotism,  the letter reads.  This country belongs to all of us, and his rhetoric of intolerance will not stand. The authors of the letter are as diverse as the crowd they re seeking to assemble.They include Reps. Jim Langevin (R.I.), who was shot accidentally as a teen and became the first quadriplegic to serve in Congress; Michelle Lujan Grisham (N.M.), head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus; Cedric Richmond (La.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus; Judy Chu (Calif.), head of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus; and David Cicilline (R.I.) and Jared Polis (Colo.), the co-chairman of the LGBT Equality Caucus. We want to send a strong message to the [president] that he cannot push these communities aside, and he cannot change the fabric of this country,  the authors wrote. Instead of celebrating the very diversity that makes our country a beacon of inclusion and equality, he has chosen to vilify, bully and alienate women, immigrants, people of color, people with disabilities, and people of differing faiths,  the Democrats stated in the letter. His rhetoric emboldens those who seek a scapegoat for the challenges this country faces,  the Democrats added.Resistance is not futile.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,2-Feb-17
" Trump Doubles Down On Being An Ass To Australia, And Twitter BUTCHERS Him (TWEETS)","Trump isn t smart. He s a complete buffoon with a temper that s so short it s virtually nonexistent. But he likes to pretend he s the President of the United States, which means he thinks he s this country s sole leader. As such, he believes he can do and say as he wishes, even if it means alienating people, countries and groups that we need.During a phone call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Trump threw a livid fit over an agreement we reached with them under Obama to accept 1,250 refugees. Trump accused Australia of planning to send us  the next Boston bomber,  and promptly hung up. Then, instead of staying quiet or actually (gasp) doing some basic homework and admitting he made a mistake with that, he took to Twitter to double down:Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017First of all, 1,250 is not  thousands.  Secondly, refugees are not illegal immigrants and Trump s calling them such is dangerous. Third, how can they be  illegal immigrants  if they aren t even here yet, and have permission, via a diplomatic pledge and paperwork, to come here? And fourth, he s not the deal-maker he thinks he is if he believes being a jackass to Turnbull is the way to handle this.Fortunately, here s Twitter, coming to the rescue and giving Trump a much-needed dressing down in front of the whole world:@realDonaldTrump Jesus. They re refugees. And Obama agreed to take them in, so they re not illegal.

 REPORT: Jared Kushner ‘F**king Furious’ Over Bannon Activity In White House (DETAILS),"Many people have looked to Donald Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to be a moderating influence on the erratic behavior of his father-in-law. This is largely true, but there s just one problem: From sundown on Friday until sundown on Saturday, Kushner observes Shabat, as he and his wife and children are Orthodox Jews. That means that Trump is left unattended with people like Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon and political operative Stephen Miller influencing his every move and appealing to his worst instincts.This seems to be the reason that some of Trump s biggest, most controversial and bumbling moves have happened on weekends   because these are things far-right extremists like Bannon and Miller are all for, while Kushner never would have allowed them to happen if he could help it. According to a source close to the situation, the timing of these blunders is no coincidence. Here are just a few items that have occurred in Kushner s absence:And of course, we re less than two weeks into the Trump presidency, so who the hell knows what is coming next? Well, it seems that Kushner is not happy with any of these developments at all. He is reportedly increasingly uneasy at the influence of far-right extremists like Miller and Bannon on Trump in his absence. Further, it seems that there is an intense power struggle within the White House, and Kushner seems to be losing. He is incensed at that development as well. He spent copious amounts of time setting up a call between Trump and Mexico s president, only to have Trump blow the whole thing up by impulsively tweeting that he should not meet with President Enrique Pena Nieto if there would be no wall payment. According to Vanity Fair, Kushner was, quote,  fucking furious. In short, Trump is taking his marching orders from Bannon and Miller, and not Kushner, and that isn t good for anyone. Kushner might be a rich, slimy sell-out, but at least he seems to be able to control Trump s worst instincts. Now that said control seems to be badly slipping, we should all be very afraid.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,2-Feb-17
 Trump Just Threw APPALLING Temper Tantrums At Some Of Our Closest Allies On The Phone,"Trump has wasted absolutely no time letting some of our allies know what he really thinks of them. On a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, he went off about a pledge the U.S. made to accept 1,250 refugees from a detention center in Australia. There are also rumors floating around that he threatened to send troops to Mexico if they don t get a handle on the border situation.While speaking to Mexico s president, Enrique Pena Nieto, last Friday, he allegedly told Nieto to control Mexico s  bad hombres,  or else we would send troops in to do it for him. The Associated Press first reported on an excerpt someone in the White House gave them of the phone call s transcript: You have a bunch of bad hombres down there,  Trump told Pena Nieto, according to the excerpt given to AP.  You aren t doing enough to stop them. I think your military is scared. Our military isn t, so I just might send them down to take care of it. Both the White House and Pena Nieto are denying that the call went this way, but a Mexican news outlet published something similar to what the AP has, and even said Trump was humiliating Pena Nieto. If it is, indeed, true that Trump said these words, then he seriously just cut down and threatened one of our neighbors with military action, or worse, invasion. Which would be the next logical step seeing as how he s done everything else he can to piss Mexico off.With Australian Prime Minister Turnbull, who was trying to confirm that we d honor our pledge to accept refugees, Trump said,  This is the worst deal ever,  and accused Turnbull of trying to send the  next Boston bombers  to us. He also blasted Turnbull about how the deal was going to kill him politically, because that s really what matters to him. Actually doing his job? Meh.Australia is one of our closest allies and Trump not only tore into him, it sounds like he hung up on Turnbull, too, well before the call was scheduled to end.We ve fought alongside, and received support from, Australia in the Middle East. They are not an ally we want to alienate, and yet, here Trump is, working as hard as he possibly can to do just that until they fall in line with what he wants.He also spent part of the call bragging about his inauguration numbers   really? He s still not over that?Anybody who thought Trump would calm the hell down after winning the election, and actually treat foreign leaders with the dignity and respect of everyone else, was sorely mistaken. He uses Twitter to berate anyone with whom he has a disagreement   why would he treat foreign leaders any differently?When he s finished bullying the entire world, we won t have any allies left (except maybe Russia).Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",News,1-Feb-17
 Trump’s Muslim Ban Protects America By Separating A Badly Burned Baby From His Family (VIDEO),"To protect America from terrorist threats that don t even exist, Donald Trump signed an executive order banning citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Since the order was signed, on Holocaust Memorial Day no less, families have been ripped apart and children have been traumatized. One of the saddest of these stories is that of a badly burned baby who is being kept from his family   to protect America. Dilbreen, at the age of about a year and a half, was severely burned,  explained Carrie Schuchardt from House of Peace in Ipswich.CBS reports:After a heater exploded in the Iraqi refugee camp where he was sleeping, an aid group got two travel visas and rushed the boy to Shriner s Hospital in Boston along with his father.After preliminary surgery, his dad returned to their war-ravaged country to be with his wife as she gave birth to Dilbreen s little brother. It was November 8, an hour before Donald Trump won the election. They named the baby  Trump. It s ironic, possibly humorous, but it s also in a way very meaningful because perhaps that child can redeem that name Trump,  Schuchardt said.Dilbreen was scheduled to have a second surgery this month and his family had made arrangements to stay at the Peace House in Ipswich, but Trump s Muslim Ban has brought those plans to a screeching halt. Thanks to the bigoted executive order, their visas have been revoked. So they are stranded in Iraq,  Schuchardt said.  The child is here. The need for surgery is pressing. On Tuesday, Massachusetts joined the ACLU lawsuit which challenges the legality of Trump s order. Attorney General Maura Healey called the Muslim Ban  harmful, discriminatory and unconstitutional. It threatens the vitality, the livelihood, the lifeblood that drives so much of Massachusetts,  Healey said.The lawsuit would help protect immigrants and visa holders already in the United States, but this doesn t mean it would do anything to help this baby waiting for surgery and his family.According to CBS, Dilbreen is currently staying with family members in Michigan and his surgery is still scheduled for Feb 5. Attorneys are still fighting for special waivers to allow his family to be with him.Can somebody please explain to me how separating a burned baby from his parents keeps America safe? How in the hell does this make America great again? This is heartless, cruel and downright shameful.Watch more on this heartbreaking story here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,1-Feb-17
 Steve Bannon Promised That There Is ‘No Doubt’ We Will Be At War With China Soon (AUDIO),"According to white supremacist dirtbag, former head honcho of far-Right propaganda factory Breitbart, and Donald Trump s chief strategist Steve Bannon, the administration expects to throw us into a war with China within the next few years if their plans work out.Speaking on his radio show in March, Bannon said that relations with China would deteriorate and we will be at  war in the South China Sea in five to 10 years. There s no doubt about that. They re taking their sandbars and making basically stationary aircraft carriers and putting missiles on those. They come here to the United States in front of our face   and you understand how important face is   and say it s an ancient territorial sea,  Bannon said.He s likely right that the United States will be involved in some conflict, but it will be because of the Trump administration that this happens. Throughout his campaign and even after he was elected President-With-An-Asterisk, the Donald has been poking China repeatedly. We can t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that s what they re doing,  Trump said while campaigning in May. We re going to turn it around. And we have the cards, don t forget it. We re like the piggy bank that s being robbed. We have the cards. We have a lot of power with China. Just before he was sworn in, Trump needled china on Twitter and caused an international incident by bragging that the President of Taiwan  CALLED  (caps are all him) to congratulate him on his victory. The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!  Donald J.

I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today s establishment    a great goal for someone Trump just installed on the National Security Council.If Trump and Bannon have their way (and so far, Republicans have allowed them to get away with a lot), they will be able to act on all their twisted fantasies of bombing every nation that they don t like.

 Staffers INSIDE The White House Are Showing Us Just How MASSIVE An A** Trump Really Is (TWEETS),"Last week, a ton of U.S. government employees took to Twitter to tell Donald Trump to go fuck himself in their own ways.

Many of their tweets are news stories and support for other rogue accounts, because all these rogue employees need to support each other.

 WATCH: Senator Al Franken Just Ripped Ted Cruz A New One For Insulting Him During Senate Hearing,"Ted Cruz accused Senator Al Franken of lying about Jeff Sessions  record on civil rights. On Wednesday, Franken fired back.Just before the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to confirm Sessions as Donald Trump s Attorney General, Franken took the Texas senator to the woodshed for disparaging his character and integrity. Cruz claimed that 1986 testimony about Sessions making racist remarks was  recanted,  which is a complete lie. Let s talk about who is trying to impugn the record of another senator,  Franken said.  I think Senator Cruz is trying to impugn mine. Republican Senator John Cornyn, of course, objected to Franken s remarks, complaining that Cruz was not in the room to respond in his own defense. You know, any excuse to try and shut down a Democrat telling the truth about a Republican snake.But Franken was ready for such whining and reminded Cornyn that he did not object when Cruz did the exact same thing to him. Senator Cruz did the very thing Senator Cornyn is accusing me of doing. In my absence  he personally went after me, he personally impugned my integrity. You didn t object then, did you? Chuck Grassley let Franken continue but warned him to  leave personalities out of it  because apparently only Republicans are allowed to personally attack the opposition during hearings.Franken was then interrupted again by a still complaining Cornyn, who insisted that Franken wait for Cruz to be in the room. Well get him here, but he ll have a tape of it,  Franken shot back.Here s the video via YouTube.If Ted Cruz did not want Franken to lambaste him during a Senate hearing he shouldn t have lied about the facts and insulted Franken in the first place.Jeff Sessions has a record of racism going back decades and his nomination to head the Justice Department is an insult to every person who fought hard for civil rights and voting rights in this country. Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for confirming him.Featured image via Nation of Change",News,1-Feb-17
 Study Shows Democrats Are Better Drivers For This SHOCKING Reason (DETAILS),"You don t have to look beyond Washington to prove what we ve known for decades, Democrats are simply better people. Democratic policies actually help people while Republican policies help themselves and corporations.Beyond Washington, though, it s been proven that Democrats make better neighbors:Democrats are more likely to offer assistance to other members of their community: over the course of a year, they are more likely than Republicans to talk with someone who is severely depressed; help a friend or neighbor find a job; or help friends, neighbors, or family members with homework. I also noted a series of differences albeit not statistically significant ones showing that Democrats more frequently loan dishes or tools to their neighbors, help strangers carry their belongings, offer up their seat on a train or bus, allow strangers to cut ahead of them in line, and give food or money directly to someone in need.Democrats are also smarter and more rational:So for liberals to make a case for an idea or cause, they come armed with data, research studies, and experts. They are convinced of an idea if all the data checks out basically they assign meaning and value to ideas that fit within the scientific method, because that s their primary thinking style. Emotion doesn t play as big of a role in validation. Not to say that liberals are unfeeling, but just more likely to set emotion aside when judging an idea initially, and factor it in later. Checks out scientifically = valuable. Liberals can get just as emotionally attached to an idea, but it s usually not the primary trigger for acceptance of an idea.Conservatives would be less likely to assign value primarily using the scientific method. Remember, their thinking style leads primarily with emotion. In order for them to find an idea valuable, it has to be meaningful for them personally. It needs to trigger empathy. Meaning, they need some kind of emotional attachment to it, such as family, or a group of individuals they are close to in some way.None of that should be terribly surprising, especially if you ve ever encountered conservatives on Facebook, and we ve all encountered conservatives on Facebook. What is surprising, though, is this study, which says we re better drivers, or at least in blue states, there are a lot fewer traffic fatalities.In all, the 14 states with the highest fatality rates went into the red column, supporting Trump. In contrast, the 12 states with the lowest fatality rates were blues that favored Clinton. In these calculations, fatality rates were determined by counting the number of road deaths in 2015 per every 100,000 people.This isn t as weird as you might think. Republicans tend to thumb their noses at constraints to their freedoms. They can t drive 55. They also tend to live in less populated areas, whereas Democrats live in areas that have a lot of traffic. Nothing slows people down faster than 1000s of brake lights ahead of them. There s more though:Another likely factor behind high fatality rates in red rural states is that their residents tend to be poorer. As a result,  Their cars are probably in worse repair. There can be a missing light in the back, or the clutch goes out,  said sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild, author of the 2016 book  Strangers In Their Own Land,  which explored views of conservatives in red state Louisiana.Hochschild also said  a kind of cowboy mentality, a kind of deregulatory, anything goes culture  exists in red states might lead to more reckless driving.They are also less likely to wear seat belts (that damn gubmint, telling people what to do).Really, though, this is just a metaphor Republicans in general. Republicans are reckless and don t give a crap about the safety of anyone who might get in their way. It s how the Republican Congress is run and it s how the roads in red states are run.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,1-Feb-17
 BREAKING: Republicans Susan Collins And Lisa Murkowski Will Vote No On Betsy DeVos,"Susan Collins, Republican Senator from Maine, has once again broke with her party after announcing she will vote  no  on Donald Trump s education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos.Lisa Murkowski, Senator from Alaska, will also vote  no  on DeVos.On the Senate floor, Collins made a passionate speech about her reservations (which are shared by fellow Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Maine), saying:I come to the floor to announce a very difficult decision that I have made, and that is to vote against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos to be our nation s next Secretary of Education.The move comes unexpectedly, as Collins voted in favor of DeVos in committee, which passed on a party line and sent her nomination to the floor for an up-or-down vote. But at that time, Collins made clear she was still considering her support. Murkowski had also voted to send DeVos  consideration to the floor.Collins had told the Bangor Daily News that she was  surprised and concerned  about her  apparent lack of familiarity  on a wide range of education issues. One issue that particularly struck Collins was the fact DeVos seemed clueless to the fact the United States has protections for students with disabilities.Susan Collins has so far been a thorn in the side of Donald Trump and his administration, recently referring to his immigration executive action as  likely unconstitutional,  and blasting Steve Bannon s appointment to the National Security Council as  entirely inappropriate. As of now, 50 senators have come out against DeVos, including Collins, Murkowski and every member of the Democratic caucus (which includes independents Bernie Sanders and Angus King). DeVos needs a simple majority to pass, and with 52 members in the GOP caucus, DeVos has a slim chance of being confirmed. If one more Republican defects, the 50-50 tie that would be broken by Vice President Mike Pence will be blockedOnce again, Susan Collins has put the country before her party, and has showed the GOP what it means to have a spine, as has Murkowski.Here s to hoping more Republicans follow their lead.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,1-Feb-17
 Congresswoman BLASTS GOP For Confirming Lifelong Racist Jeff Sessions On First Day Of Black History Month (TWEETS),"Many people observe Black History Month by learning about important African-American figures in our nation s history or otherwise doing something that isn t horrible   then there are Republicans, who have their own ways to celebrate.Donald Trump spent Wednesday hanging out with all the black people he has paid and bribed to like him and having them shower him with compliments. While treating African-Americans as nothing more than subservient praise machines is, oh, let s just say  bad,  The Donald s friends on the Senate Judiciary Committee spent the early part of theirconfirming lifelong opponent of civil rights Jeff Sessions day as Attorney General (every Democrat voted against him).Sessions  confirmation   especially on Wednesday or any day during Black History Month   was a slap in the face to African-Americans and all who care about equal rights in this country. Many have criticized Republicans for their decision to consider Sessions   who was once deemed too racist to be a federal judge because he threw the n-word around and liked calling African-Americans  boy    at all, but the GOP was perfectly happy to push his nomination through.Following Sessions  ascension to a post that, to use terms familiar to him, is just below  Grand Wizard,  Rep. Barbara Lee took to Twitter to put Trump and his GOP Klavern on blast. Trump says he s  honoring  #BlackHistoryMonth How? By nominating Jeff Sessions as AG? Or by promoting alt-right leader Steve Bannon?  she wrote in one tweet, adding that The Donald is  paying lip service  to Black History Month while propping up racist Sessions and longtime white supremacist Steve Bannon and their ideas.Trump says he s  honoring  #BlackHistoryMonth.

 WATCH: Trump ‘Honors’ Black History Month By Praising Himself And Attacking The Media,"It s the first day of Black History Month and Donald Trump was quick to celebrate it inappropriately.February is the month when our country recognizes the long history of African-Americans. Their achievements and struggles are America s achievements and struggles and we must recognize both to move forward and create a better future.But rather than honor Black History Month with the dignity it deserves, Donald Trump made it all about him instead.During a breakfast in the White House Cabinet Room, Trump said a few words about Black History Month.During this month we honor the tremendous history of the African-Americans throughout our country, throughout the world if you think about it, right? And this story is one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work, and faith in America. And then after giving a shout out to his token black cabinet member Ben Carson, who heads Housing and Urban Development despite having zero experience, he started bitching about and attacking the media over a report on Trump s first day that the Martin Luther King bust had been removed from the Oval Office, a mistake that was quickly corrected the same day but Trump still whines about. The statue is cherished, it s one of the favorite things, and we have some good ones, we have Lincoln and we have Jefferson, we have Dr. Martin Luther King,  he said.Trump then praised Fox News for kissing his ass and once again talked about inner cities as if they are crime-ridden war zones. I don t like watching fake news. Fox has treated me very nice, I don t know where Fox is, thank you. We need more jobs, better wages. We re going to work very hard in the inner city. Ben will be doing that, one of his big things. We need safer communities. We re going to do that with law enforcement. We re going to make it safe. We re going to make it much better than it is right now. Right now it s terrible. Not content to just use Black History Month as an excuse to air his petty grievances, Trump chose to pat himself on the back as well. If you remember, I wasn t going to do well with the African-American community. And after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things. We ended up getting   I won t go into details but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years. Hillary Clinton received 88 percent of the black vote on Election Day while Trump only received 8 percent, hardly something to brag about.Trump then gave permission to his black supporters to lavish him with praise.An Ohio pastor told Trump that  we love you  and actually dared to mention Trump and God in the same breath. He also somehow kept a straight face while claiming that Trump is a good listener.Trump then returned to bashing the media and whining. So much of the media is opposition party. Knowingly saying incorrect things. It s a very sad situation. But we seem to be doing well. You know, it s almost like, in the meantime we won. So maybe they don t have the influence they think. They really have to straighten out their act. They re very dishonest people. Here s the unbelievable video via YouTube.Basically, Trump said more about Omarosa and his black media surrogates than he did about black history, reducing the names of King, Rosa Parks, and Frederick Douglass to mere footnotes in his remarks and once again demonstrating that he is a disgrace.Featured image via screenshot",News,1-Feb-17
 Republicans Just Changed The Rules To Force Through Trump’s Controversial Nominees,"Senate Republicans on Wednesday took an extraordinary step to force through two of alleged president Donald Trump s top Cabinet nominees after a boycott from Democrats. Republican lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee changed the rules so there will no longer be a requirement for Democrats to be present to achieve quorum.Republicans then forced through the controversial picks of Rep. Tom Price for Secretary of Health and Human Services and Steve Mnuchin for Secretary of Treasury.Democrats boycotted for very good reasons:Democrats launched their boycott Tuesday because they felt there were too many unanswered questions about the two nominees  possible ethics violations. They refused to participate in the process if there wouldn t be more time for vetting. When not a single Democrat showed up on Tuesday, the vote could not proceed, because of a rule requiring at least one member from the minority party be present.Every single seat on the Democrats  side of the dais was empty.Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) called the boycott  extraordinary circumstances  and allowed the Republicans in the room vote to suspend the rules of the committee.  They, on their own accord, refused to participate in the exercise,  he said.  They have nobody to blame but themselves. The day before, Hatch said the Democrats were  acting like idiots  for their boycott. He said that as if he has no memory of the obstruction Republicans openly launched against President Obama for 8 years.And Democrats have ample reasons to scrutinize the nominees. There is evidence that both Price and Mnuchin lied to the committee.That swamp is being filled with terrifying creatures:For example, Mnuchin has even acknowledged that his answers were not  true, accurate, and complete,  as was apparent from his need to revise his initial disclosure questionnaire twice because of entities he  inadvertently missed.  He also testified that OneWest Bank never used  robo-signers,  even though it frequently did.And there were already questions about whether he was qualified to serve in the position in the first place. Mnuchin s bank foreclosed on tens of thousands of people while accepting $1 billion in loan forgiveness from the FDIC, and may have even broken the law by backdating documents to rush foreclosures.Price, too, has issues. He was involved in legislation that could have benefited his stock holdings. His tax returns and financial disclosure statements were brought into question ahead of the hearing.In the end, both of Trump s nominees were approved 14 0.Hatch was confronted by reporters who rushed over to the building because of the little notice given to the public about the meeting to suspend the rules. He reportedly chuckled and said,  You were scrambling? Well, you know, that s neither here nor there. Hatch admitted that he has not yet spoken with the committee s top Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden.  I don t feel a bit sorry for them,  he said.Questions will be left unanswered:Democrats asked that Price offer clarify on  inaccurate and misleading answer to questions about privileged and discounted access to stocks,  and wanted Mnuchin to address  inaccurate and misleading answer to questions about the potentially illegal process known as robo-signing,  among other things. I don t care what they want at this point,  Hatch said.One thing we could agree with Trump on is that the swamp needs to be drained. Of course, we knew he wouldn t keep that promise. Republicans have launched an attack on democracy.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News,1-Feb-17
" Reuters News Agency Declares War On Trump In The Most PERFECT Way, Trump HUMILIATED","Donald Trump s treatment of journalists is so bad that the Reuters news agency is now advising reporters to treat Trump like they would treat a foreign dictator.On Tuesday, Trump and his team announced that they will no longer send surrogates to appear on CNN, an escalation of the war Trump has been waging against the news network, which he calls  fake news  because they won t promote his agenda.Trump has even praised Fox New s biased reporting as something CNN should copy.Furthermore, Trump and his team have repeatedly threatened and tried to intimidate journalists for doing their jobs just because they aren t writing puff pieces that kiss Trump s ass.Well, Reuters is doing something about it.For 165 years, Reuters has been bringing us news from around the world. They ve been in the most peaceful and democratic places, but they ve also been in war zones and reported on the most dangerous and tyrannical regimes in world history.In a message to staff on Tuesday, Reuters Editor-in-Chief Steve Adler advised his reporters to start dealing with Trump the way they have dealt with brutal dictators in the past. It s not every day that a U.S. president calls journalists  among the most dishonest human beings on earth  or that his chief strategist dubs the media  the opposition party,  Adler wrote.  It s hardly surprising that the air is thick with questions and theories about how to cover the new Administration. Adler then revealed his solution for how reporters should handle Trump.So what is the Reuters answer? To oppose the administration? To appease it? To boycott its briefings? To use our platform to rally support for the media? All these ideas are out there, and they may be right for some news operations, but they don t make sense for Reuters. We already know what to do because we do it every day, and we do it all over the world.To state the obvious, Reuters is a global news organization that reports independently and fairly in more than 100 countries, including many in which the media is unwelcome and frequently under attack. I am perpetually proud of our work in places such as Turkey, the Philippines, Egypt, Iraq, Yemen, Thailand, China, Zimbabwe, and Russia, nations in which we sometimes encounter some combination of censorship, legal prosecution, visa denials, and even physical threats to our journalists. We respond to all of these by doing our best to protect our journalists, by recommitting ourselves to reporting fairly and honestly, by doggedly gathering hard-to-get information   and by remaining impartial. We write very rarely about ourselves and our troubles and very often about the issues that will make a difference in the businesses and lives of our readers and viewers.We don t know yet how sharp the Trump administration s attacks will be over time or to what extent those attacks will be accompanied by legal restrictions on our news-gathering. But we do know that we must follow the same rules that govern our work anywhere.If Donald Trump thinks his relationship with the media is going to get better because he attacks them, he should think again. Reuters is coming for him and he should be scared, especially if other news organizations follow their example.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,1-Feb-17
" Trump Says His Ban Isn’t A Ban And Only Keeps ‘Bad’ People Out, Gets His A** Handed To Him","Donald Trump just got caught lying on Twitter again and got totally humiliated with his own tweets.The world is still reeling after Trump signed an executive order banning travelers from entering the United States from seven different countries that he considers a  threat  to American safety.Trump has been touting his Muslim ban as one of his greatest achievements even though it is totally unconstitutional.Pretty much everyone understands that his order is a ban.But on Wednesday morning, Trump actually tried to claim that his order may not be a ban at all by claiming that everyone is arguing about whether or not it s a ban. He also claimed that the purpose of the ban is to keep  bad  people out of the country as if  bad  people only come from those nations.Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN.

 Trump Announces That Surrogates Won’t Appear On Networks That Don’t ‘Promote’ His Agenda,"CNN viewers will no longer be entertained by the car crash-caliber antics of Trump s trailer park propaganda minister Kellyanne Conway. Politico reports that the Trump White House will be freezing out news organizations that do not  promote  his hateful agenda   and The Donald s favorite  fake news  outlet is the first victim of this extremely questionable policy. We re sending surrogates to places where we think it makes sense to promote our agenda,  a White House official explained. A CNN reporter had a more honest explanation of what is going on: They re trying to cull CNN from the herd. White House Press Secretary, notorious liar and legendary moron Sean Spicer, claims that the network is not being frozen out because he sometimes answers the network s questions but he does not deny that administration officials are not appearing on CNN. I m not going to sit around and engage with people who have no desire to actually get something right,  he said ironically, apparently forgetting that he famously falsely claimed that Trump had the biggest inaugural crowd  ever. Just last month, Trump refused to take a question from CNN because he says they are  fake news. This move is unprecedented. While Presidents have feuded with news networks in the past   President Obama and Fox News, for instance   they did not intentionally freeze out the networks. Obama officials, for example, appeared on Fox regularly.This is a clear attempt to damage CNN s ratings by denying them access to the Trump White House   an immature and unpresidential move by a thin-skinned bully, and it is entirely unacceptable to only send representatives to networks that are willing to lie for him.If the standard for the Trump White House sending representatives to a network is their willingness to  promote  his agenda, everyone should aspire to be exactly like CNN. No news network should ever promote any President s agenda when it conflicts with the facts.Featured image via screengrab/Getty Images (Drew Angerer)",News,1-Feb-17
 WATCH: Jon Stewart Joins Colbert To HUMILIATE Trump For Issuing Tyrannical Executive Orders,"As Donald Trump continues to issue executive orders as if he is a king, Jon Stewart showed up on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to mock him.Stewart has been humiliating Trump for years so this was just like riding a bike. Once you do it, you never forget how to do it. And Stewart absolutely nailed Trump on Tuesday night.As Colbert spoke about Trump s unconstitutional executive orders, Stewart interrupted and surprised a gleeful crowd in the process.Stewart sat down and told Colbert that he knows what Trump s next executive orders will be and proceeded to act like Trump while reading them off. I hereby direct that to secure our border, China shall immediately and without hesitation send us their wall. Done. Boom!  Stewart began.It makes sense, too, since Trump has repeatedly antagonized China over the last few months to the point where a confrontation could occur between China and the United States in the near future if Trump continues to to try to bully them.Stewart then declared that America has a new national language. The new official language of the United States is bullshit,  he said.  I, Donald J. Trump, have instructed my staff to speak only in bullshit. Stewart went on to declare that the staff must only speak bullshit at work and at home. None of those pesky facts are acceptable at any time.Then Stewart revealed the third executive order Trump will sign. I Donald J. Trump am exhausting. It has been eleven days, Stephen. Eleven f*cking days. Eleven! The presidency is supposed to age the president, not the public. The reason that I, Donald J. Trump, am exhausting is that every instinct and fiber of my pathological self regard calls me to abuse of power.Stewart then mocked Trump s request to have tanks at his parade and his whining because he isn t adored by the whole nation.Stewart compared Trump to Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars and said that the American people are going to have a hell of a fight trying to prevent him from destroying democracy. We have never faced this before,  Stewart concluded.  Purposeful, vindictive chaos. But Stewart urged Americans to keep fighting because if America can somehow survive through the next four years and defeat Trump in 2020, we can truly make America great again.Here s the video via VidMe.It sure would be nice to have Jon Stewart on our televisions every day to bring laughter to our lives as Trump continues to cause national and worldwide chaos.Featured image via screenshot",News,1-Feb-17
 Sean Spicer Refused To Define ‘Betrayal’ So The Merriam-Webster Dictionary Did It For Him (TWEETS),"On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer refused to define the word  betrayal  after President Asterisk accused former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates of  betraying  the Justice Department by refusing to enforce his unconstitutional Muslim ban. Is it a betrayal? That s a very odd word,  one reporter asked Spicer. Another asked why the word was used. One, probably correctly assuming that Spicer just didn t know the definition, asked him to provide one. I m not going to define the word,  Spicer replied defiantly. But not to worry, the Merriam-Webster dictionary came to the rescue, throwing some serious shade Spicer s way in the process:?Lookups for 'betrayal' spiked after Sean Spicer said ""I'm not going to define the word.""We defined the word. https://t.co/alq6KqMgnF  Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) January 31, 2017To help Spicer out, Merriam-Webster went into quite a bit of detail in their explanation:Betrayal is the noun that came from the verb betray, which has several meanings, including  to deliver to an enemy by treachery,   to fail or desert especially in time of need,   to reveal unintentionally,  and  to disclose in violation of confidence.  Betrayal means  the act of betraying or fact of being betrayed. Betray was used in President Trump s memo dismissing Yates:The acting Attorney, General Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States.Although the verb betray has been in use for a considerable length of time dating back to the 13th century, the noun betrayal is much more recent. Our records indicate that the word began to enter general use around the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries.I am to let my Moderation be known unto all Men: How? Not in a sinful Compliance with unwarrantable Practices, or a Tracherous betrayal of our Constitution either in Church or State, any more then Prosecuting the Interests of either with a bitter and unbecoming Zeal.In Monday s announcement, Yates wrote:My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts. In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.They also recently helped out with  refugee. 'Refugee' came directly from the French word 'r fugi '. The word originally referred to the Huguenots. https://t.co/CcQX1HG1r4  Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) January 28, 2017 And  Calamity,  a word many are using to describe Trump s presidency.? @JohnWDean bears witness: Says Trump 'calamity' is almost a certainty. #NowTrending https://t.co/IV963Qt5zC  Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) January 31, 2017 And made the Right feel stupid for calling people  snowflakes  when the term should be turned inward:In Missouri in the early 1860s, a 'snowflake' was a person who was opposed to the abolition of slavery. https://t.co/XtIlA4ARV5  Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) January 30, 2017Merriam-Webster also made headlines when Trump called something an  unpresidented  act:Good morning! The #WordOfTheDay is not 'unpresidented'. We don't enter that word. That's a new one. https://t.co/BJ45AtMNu4  Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) December 17, 2016When liberals joke that Trump supporters  greatest enemy is the dictionary, we often have no idea how right we are.Featured image via Getty Images (Alex Wong)/screengrab",News,1-Feb-17
 FIRST LOOK: Obamas Spotted In British Virgin Islands On Well-Deserved Vacation (VIDEO),"With everything being so utterly chaotic under the new seeming dictatorship of Donald Trump, it s left many longing for the days of former President Barack Obama.In only a little over a week, Trump has signed nearly two dozen Executive Orders, causing chaos at home and abroad.However, for all those desperately seeking a break from the new fascist regime of the Trump administration, the Obama family was spotted in the British Virgin Islands.According to TMZ: Barack and Michelle were spotted Tuesday on one of the British Virgin Islands with their pal, Sir Richard Branson. The former First Couple touched down on Branson s nearby Necker Island just over a week ago. The Obamas look happy and healthy and, best of all, relaxed. They definitely seem to be taking in the sun and sand of a very deserved vacation after being First Family of the nation for eight years. Goodness knows they need it.The last thing the Obamas likely want is to be brought into the turmoil of the Trump administration. However, knowing Barack Obama, and the fact the fact that he loves the nation more than himself, he ll undoubtedly do whatever he can to prevent Trump from unraveling his eight years of progress.In the mean time, enjoy the Obamas are enjoying their time off.Watch here:Barack Obama & Michelle Obama spotted out in the British Virgin Islands pic.twitter.com/IhWsoRXbxu  MEFeater Magazine (@mefeater) February 1, 2017Featured image via video screen capture",News,1-Feb-17
 Sean Spicer Just Said The DUMBEST Thing About Obama’s ‘Fourth Term’ In Office (VIDEO),"According to White House Propaganda Minister Sean Spicer, it was completely fine that conservatives endlessly delayed President Obama s Supreme Court pick because it was his  fourth term. I know what you re thinking   The White House press secretary couldn t possibly be so stupid that he would not know how many terms a President can legally serve (two)   but it s true. Spicer explained that the Democrats had a responsibility to confirm any  qualified  Supreme Court nominee of Trump s despite the campaign last year to deprive President Obama of the same courtesy. According to Spicer, this is completely different because: There s never been a situation in which you had a fourth term, someone that late in an election cycle. That had never occurred before. And I think the Senate Republicans were very clear that we should wait and let the voters have a choice. And that s exactly what happened. Yes, fourth term. We didn t even get the third term conservatives were sure Obama would have and the rest of us desperately wish he could have had and Spicer thinks he served for 16 years. but he is right that the obstruction on the part of the GOP was unprecedented. There really is something unique about the position Republican senators are taking with respect to the Scalia vacancy,  law professor Jason Mazzone told The New York Times last year.  We really did not find any precedent for the idea, notwithstanding the Senate s very broad powers in this area, that a sitting president could be denied outright the authority to offer up a nominee who would receive evaluation through normal Senate processes. There is a difference between the Senate rejecting, as it s quite entitled to do, a particular nominee on the merits, and the Senate taking the position that a president cannot exercise a constitutionally delegated power,  he added.Trump s nominee isn t exactly qualified, as he has sided against the right of women to have available to them a full array of healthcare options, including a decision related to Hobby Lobby. He has also stated that  secular courts  do not have the right to interfere with [the Christian] religion, even when businesses are practicing discrimination against women.Watch Spicer s latest f*ckup below:Featured image via screenshots",News,1-Feb-17
 Democratic Senator Joins #THERESISTANCE: Says Trump Stole Obama’s SCOTUS Seat (DETAILS),"We all remember when Justice Antonin Scalia died last year, leaving a vacancy on the United States Supreme Court. As a result of his death, President Barack Obama did his job and nominated a qualified federal judge to replace Scalia on the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland.Garland was a centrist, and a completely uncontroversial nominee for the land s highest court. However, Mitch McConnell decided that his goal was to obstruct President Obama, and he and the rest of the Republicans in the Senate decided not to meet with Judge Garland, and to give him no hearing and no vote. Now that we have a new president in Donald Trump, a right-wing extremist approved by far-right activist groups like the Heritage Foundation has been nominated in one Neil Gorsuch. To that end, Democrats are taking to the streets as they have been doing since Trump s election to pressure their elected Senators to oppose Trump s pick.One Democratic Senator, Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) has said that he will defend and keep open the Supreme Court seat that was effectively stolen from President Obama. Merkley says via Twitter:Not only is this a stolen seat, but @realDonaldTrump has nominated a far right extremist. Unacceptable. https://t.co/9bkw4QODXD pic.twitter.com/iVHDdb2Pn9  Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) February 1, 2017Part of the statement reads: This strategy of packing the court, if successful, could threaten fundamental rights in America, including workers  right to organize, women s reproductive rights, and the rights of ordinary citizens to have their voices heard in elections rather than being drowned out by the corrupting influenceof dark money from the richest Americans. If President Trump were serious about healing the divisions in America and undoing the damage wrought by Senate Republicans last year, he could have named Merrick Garland to fill this seat. Garland is a centrist jurist who is respected on both sides of the aisle. Instead, he doubled down on division by picking an ideological and extreme nominee to satisfy the far right. Senator Merkley is right. The Court should not be packed with far-right   or, for that matter, far-left- ideologues. It should be filled with thoughtful, intellectual jurists who will not let personal opinions supercede the rule of law. That means nothing to the GOP, though; they just want their anti-worker, anti-poor, anti-gay, anti-immigrant, anti-woman agenda pushed through   damage to the nation s highest court be damned.In short, Merkley is urging his Democratic colleagues in the United States Senate to stand up to Republican obstruction, to make them look as bad as possible, and to save the Court from far-right ideologues who would destroy and roll back rights for all Americans except the rich, straight, white, and male a century.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,1-Feb-17
" Trump’s SCOTUS Pick Sided With Hobby Lobby Against Women, Thinks Christianity Trumps ‘Secular Courts’","On Tuesday, Donald Trump announced the identity of his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. At first glance, Trump s pick appears to be a typical, hardworking Aryan man who pledges to uphold the Constitution. Unfortunately, he is not the man he pretends to be.The Denver Post notes that Gorsuch is best known for siding against reason and sanity in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores. On top of that, he feels that anything related to Christianity   including attempts to use the religion as a shield while a bigoted corporation denies women full access to their healthcare options   is above  secular courts. It is not for secular courts to rewrite the religious complaint of a faithful adherent, or to decide whether a religious teaching about complicity imposes  too much  moral disapproval on those only  indirectly  assisting wrongful conduct,  Gorsuch wrote in his opinion. Ultimately, the then conservative-heavy Supreme Court ruled in favor of corporations  right to deprive people to healthcare options if they slap a Bible verse next to their explanation of their decision. Gorsuch also sided with a Catholic organization in another anti-Obamacare case. Judge Gorsuch has a record of ruling in a way that does not reflect Colorado values on reproductive rights. This is a pro-choice state that supports the constitutional right to abortion enshrined in Roe v. Wade and the right to privacy enshrined in Griswold v. Connecticut   beliefs that are contradicted in Judge Gorsuch s ruling in Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters,  Karen Middleton, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado, said following Trump s announcement. Colorado has a long, bipartisan history of supporting reproductive rights. Judge Gorsuch does not reflect the will of our state or the constitutional rights of American women and we would oppose his nomination. It s not just Colorado whose values Gorsuch doesn t reflect. A full 89 percent of Americans say that birth control is morally acceptable, compared to 72 percent who say the same about divorce and 13 percent who are in favor of cloning human. He and Trump may be in the minority, but nevertheless Gorsuch has taken his first step toward a lifetime position where he can continue to push his poisonous views and agenda.It might seem like an attractive idea to hope that Gorsuch will do his job well, but we cannot gamble with a lifetime position. It is up to us as Americans to demand that our elected officials say  no  to this man, who clearly is unable to think rationally wherever  moral  issues are concerned.Featured Image via Getty Images/Alex wong",News,31-Jan-17
 It Took A Scathing Letter From Canada’s Prime Minister To Make Fox News FINALLY Correct Fake Story,"Fox News couldn t wait to try to spin the Quebec mosque attack. Jumping on early reports, Fox tweeted yesterday,  Suspect in Quebec mosque terror attack was of Moroccan origin, reports show.  Well, this turned out not to be the case at all. In fact, the shooter was actually a white man who had quietly become a Trump-loving right-wing extremist.However, Fox never bothered to take down the post once the truth became clear. I mean, a right-wing nutjob shooting up a mosque hardly helps convince their  poorly educated  viewers that every Muslim is a terrorist, now does it? The Moroccan guy ended up just having been a witness to the deadly attack. So, the  news  channel (and I use that word very loosely), tweeted this follow-up statement but failed to delete the original post.@FoxNews Mosque attack suspect formally charged w/ six counts of murder; Second man cleared, identified as a witness https://t.co/oRzxGHEXDm  Fox News (@FoxNews) January 30, 2017Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was not about to let Fox get away with using his nation s tragedy to advance their bigoted agenda.

 WATCH: Jake Tapper STUNNED Into Disbelief Listening To Sean Spicer Whine That Press Says ‘Ban’,"Sean Spicer is doing his level best to make enemies out of the press and paint Trump as a victim of the media s alarmist lies. Or something. Today it was about Trump s Muslim ban   Spicer seems to be irritated that the media keeps saying  ban.  Apparently, Spicer thinks that everyone needs to stop using that word because Trump s Muslim ban is not a ban of any sort. Trump said so.CNN s Jake Tapper couldn t seem to keep his jaw off the floor while covering Spicer s comments. Trump said  ban  on Twitter, and Sean Spicer has said  ban  multiple times himself. Tapper starts off with Spicer s comments, and then launches into a fact-check: Not a ban, okay. But I could ve sworn I heard somebody in the Trump administration using the term  ban  before. Was it possibly President Trump, on Twitter? Oh well gee, with it up in print, one would think Spicer would be a little smarter. Not only is he not, though, he seems to have forgotten that he himself used the word  ban  to describe the Muslim ban multiple times himself.Tapper wonders aloud why, if Spicer objects to a term, he keeps using it. The way he ends it is so spot-on that it s almost side-splitting.Watch below:.@jaketapper with a remarkable 2-minute fact-check on @PressSec pic.twitter.com/GGjQ21GMUb  Nolan D.

 An Anonymous Group Just Revealed The Direct Phone Numbers For White House Staffers,"Just after Donald Trump was sworn in, his administration dismantled the White House switchboard comment operating system. But now, there s a way to circumvent the alleged president s attempt to stifle dissention, thanks to an anonymous group. There was a time when this wasn t necessary. The public could call to express concerns during the Obama administration, but that was then and this is now. The public comments line was shut down and people who want to call in to complain are prompted to send messages through Facebook Messenger or other forms of social media. The  for all Americans  fake president doesn t want to hear your complaints. He is in power to receive adulation and nothing less.Then  White House Comment Line,  created by an anonymous group, came to the rescue. Open communication is the foundation of a good, functioning democracy,  a spokesperson for the group explained to the Gothamist in a statement.  But it s a two-way street. Right now there s  information  coming out of the White House to the people, but not much the other way around. They may have shut down the comment line, but we the people still have comments. In light of that, we wanted to create one way for the people to be heard. The group released phone numbers of White House staffers but intentionally did not include any they believed had a role in national security.The Gothamist reports:A solid chunk of the numbers were disconnected, probably during the Obama-to-Trump transition, but it s possible they ll be put back in use if Trump ever gets around to hiring White House staffers. We ve been calling the numbers on the list and have found a few fun ones somewhere in there you ll get a voice mailbox belonging to one  Conway, Kellyanne.

 Trump Jr. Just ‘Liked’ Tweet Praising Mosque Shooting In Quebec; The Reason Why Is Even Worse (IMAGE),"When it comes to how shameless the Trump family seems to be, it seems to be limitless. They seem to only care about what effects them personally, and how powerful they can become at whatever cost comes to others along the way.What Donald Trump Jr. just  Liked  on Twitter is just more proof of this.As several Muslims in Quebec, Canada, perished in a Mosque shooting, many mourned this loss. It was a horrific act of violence, and no one should ever have to be a part of such a thing.However, having no heart and clearly no grasp of the details of the situation, Trump Jr. decided he would appreciate how much political capital could come out of this if the shooter was Muslim.The tweet Trump Jr.  Liked  reads as such: When it s revealed that the #QuebecShooting terrorists are Muslims, #Trump will have a tremendous spike in political capital. #MuslimBan via TwitterTrump Jr. seems to not so much care about the loss of life, but rather about the fact that his dad could score some political points.This is what a sociopath looks like.As it turns out, the shooter wasn t Muslim, and was, in fact, an extremist white guy who is a fan of Donald Trump. This isn t to say that Trump s anti-Muslim rhetoric here in the United States is what led to the shooting, but it certainly is an interesting, and very concerning, coincidence.It s disgusting that one of the first thoughts out of Donald Trump Jr. s brain was how he could use people dying to his dad s advantage. He should be ashamed of himself.Featured Photo by David Becker/Getty Images",News,31-Jan-17
 WATCH: Ellen DeGeneres Cleverly Uses ‘Finding Dory’ To Teach Trump That Walls Don’t Work,"When Ellen DeGeneres found out that Donald Trump watched Finding Dory as his immigration ban was causing worldwide chaos, she used it as a teaching moment.On Friday, Trump signed an unconstitutional executive order banning people traveling from seven countries from entering the United States. International outrage ensued as people and governments around the globs condemned the ban and protests raged across the country.On Sunday, Trump watched the Disney/Pixar film in the White House as the protests continued and apparently learned nothing from watching it.So on Tuesday, DeGeneres told Trump what he should have learned. I don t get political, so I m not gonna talk about the travel ban,  DeGeneres began.  I m just gonna talk about the very nonpolitical, family-friendly, People s Choice Award-winning Finding Dory. DeGeneres explained that the character of Dory lives in the ocean near Australia, but she decides to travel to America to find her parents, whom she remembers after getting her memory jogged. Dory and her friends reach California, only to find a wall standing in their way and they proceed to do what is necessary to get around the obstacle.Finding Dory is about a fish named Dory and Dory lives in Australia. These are here parents. They live in America. I don t know what religion they are but her dad sounds a little Jewish. Doesn t matter! Dory arrives in America with her friends Marlin and Nemo and she ends up at the Marine Life Institute behind a large wall. They all have to get over the wall and you won t believe it but that wall has almost no effect in keeping them out.   Even though Dory gets into America, she gets separated from her family. Other animals help Dory   animals that don t even need her, animals that don t have anything in common with her. They help her even though they re completely different colors because that s what you do when you see someone in need. You help them.Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, walls are a main obstacle throughout the movie, but the characters find a way to circumvent them every time, just as immigrants are going to circumvent Trump s massive and expensive wall along the southern border.As the Berlin Wall teaches us, people will find a way no matter how deadly the risks are.At least 5,000 people entered West Germany across the heavily guarded wall to escape the tyranny of the Soviet Union. 138 people died trying.If people are desperate enough, they will find a way to live in America. Travel bans and walls will not stop immigrants and refugees from seeking a better life for themselves and their families.Featured image via screenshot",News,31-Jan-17
 Hot Mic Catches Someone Saying What We All Were Thinking During This GOP Presser (VIDEO),"On Tuesday, a hot mic at a House Republican presser caught someone saying exactly what we were all thinking.After House Speaker Paul Ryan told press that he was kept in the dark about Donald Trump s Muslim ban, someone was heard complaining that the press conference was a  waste of my f*cking time. Initially, it was rumored that Ryan   who had just told press that he and other Republicans were kept in the dark about Trump s Muslim ban until it was being implemented   had uttered the words. While he would have had every reason, Mediaite quickly quelled the rumor before it spread (a nice contrast to what we see happen in conservative media):Watching the video, Ryan was well away from the microphones when the comment was tossed out. In all likelihood, this was either a reporter or a tech who was a little too close (and loud) to the network s mic.The accusation was initially made by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi s Deputy Chief of Staff Drew Hammill. Because he is adult, he apologized for the error and everyone went on with their day..@BrendanBuck tells me that was not his boss. Will take his word for it and I apologized.  Drew Hammill (@Drew_Hammill) January 31, 2017@Drew_Hammill thank you. appreciate it. he s not really an f-bomb guy.  Brendan Buck (@BrendanBuck) January 31, 2017But Ryan might as well have said it was a waste of his time, because it was. Today, we received confirmation that Donald Trump is completely shutting even his political allies out of the decision-making process. We were briefed on the contents of it as it was being rolled out,  Ryan said.  Clearly, none of us want to see people with green cards get implicated in this. And that s not the goal here. What the president has asked us to focus on, something that we ve ran on, is we ve got to secure our border,  he continued.  We have a border security problem, that s what the physical barrier on the border is all about and we have security concerns given this age of terrorism, given the fact that we have drugs coming across our border, we have an opioid problem. There are lots of reasons why our focus is first and foremost is on border security,  Ryan said.In other words, they ve been told to sit in the corner while daddy does the important stuff.This press conference was a waste of time. The Republican Party (and Congress as a whole) has been largely shut out of any major decisions in this country if Trump even remotely has the power to just do it himself   and unfortunately, he intends to use the full power of the presidency to do the same thing to America that he does to his businesses.Whomever was caught complaining was 100 percent right. There was no need for anyone to be there or for Republicans to pretend that they are even remotely important anymore in Trump s America. Thank you, anonymous hero, for pointing out exactly what is wrong with our country at the moment.Featured image via screengrab",News,31-Jan-17
" Trump Got An Eight-Year-Old American Girl Killed, Along With Other Children And Women","Donald Trump is an incompetent commander-in-chief and he just proved it with the first military raid he ordered.Since December 2014, the United States had refrained from putting boots on the ground in Yemen to fight terrorists because the region has become so dangerous and unstable.President Obama effectively used drone strikes to take down terrorist leaders instead.But in an apparent move to somehow prove that he s a tough guy, Trump ordered a military raid in Yemen that should get him arrested for murder.That s because an eight-year-old American girl was killed after being shot through the neck by American troops during the raid, which Trump and his team bragged about because 14 Al Qaeda militants were also killed.Nawar al-Awlaki surely was not expecting to die at the age of eight. But after two hours of suffering on Sunday, she passed away, thus being denied the chance to grow up by a tyrant thousands of miles away in the White House.Nawar was the daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a United States citizen who joined the terrorist organization and was subsequently killed by a drone strike in 2011. Her 16-year-old brother was killed by a drone strike two weeks later.But we re talking about an eight-year-old girl here. Not a terrorist. And she was an American citizen. She was hit with a bullet in her neck and suffered for two hours,  Nawar s grandfather Nasser al-Awlaki told the press.  Why kill children? This is the new (U.S.) administration   it s very sad, a big crime. Indeed, it is a crime and one that Trump and his entire administration should have to answer for.Nawar wasn t the only child to be murdered, however. Other children were killed in the raid and so were women. Medics on the scene said there were at least nine dead women and children because American military forces obeyed an order from a madman.And what s truly scary is that Trump is so willing to kill American citizens and call it  collateral damage. No one can say that this girl was a terrorist, yet she was killed anyway as if she were.One wonders whether Trump will start targeting Americans he considers his  enemies  now that white supremacist Steve Bannon sits on the National Security Council, the same council that makes the decisions about whether an American should be targeted for assassination. After all, Trump has no qualms about killing innocent children so clearly Trump would do anything and say it s all in the name of national security.White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer made that clear on Monday when he said that it would be  misguided and wrong  to NOT handcuff a five-year-old child who was being detained and separated from his mother by airport security because he was traveling from Iran, on of the seven nations including in Trump s Muslim ban.So not only is Trump killing children, he s having them arrested, too, just because they happen to have brown skin and have connections to nations in the Middle East. Seriously.This is the kind of bullshit that terrorists will use to recruit more people to their cause, which will make our country less safe down the road as terrorists make plans to get revenge.By killing this little girl along with other children and women, Trump is no better than the terrorists who indiscriminately kill Americans on our own soil. And he s going to continue displaying his incompetence when it comes to military matters for the next four years if nothing is done to remove him from power to show the world that we do not in any way condone what he is doing. That being said, it s time for the military to stand up to Trump and be as brave as acting Attorney General Sally Yates was before Trump fired her.The United States military should not be ordered to conduct a raid if it means innocent women and children will be killed. The price is just way too high.Featured image via Twitter",News,31-Jan-17
 WATCH: Trump Gets SKEWERED By Morning Joe For Firing Acting Attorney General Like A True Tyrant,"Joe Scarborough says Donald Trump is acting like a dictator because of the way he fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates.Yates stood up to Trump and refused to defend his unconstitutional executive order banning people from entering the United States if they are traveling from seven specific countries in the Middle East and Africa.The order violates constitutional rights and caused worldwide chaos over the weekend while sparking protests and condemnation around the globe. The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,  Trump said in a statement from the White House.  Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration. Trump s words shocked the Morning Joe host, who compared the way Trump fired Yates to how a tyrant would do it. The word  betrayed,  using the word betrayed for somebody, that s frightening,  Scarborough said on Tuesday morning.  That s what an autocrat would use, whoever put that word in there. An autocrat is just another term for  dictator  or  tyrant. Scarborough went on to slam Trump for acting like a petulant child. There are people that can have reasonable differences without saying that, if they don t agree with you, they ve betrayed you. That is frightening, chilling language, whether they had a right to do this or not  But saying somebody  betrayed  the Justice Department because they don t agree with you? Take that to Venezuela, OK? We don t really want to use that sort of language here. It s time for you guys to grow up. Here s the video via YouTube.Apparently, Donald Trump intends to fire anyone in our government who disagrees with him, and that s dangerous.Yates, as acting Attorney General, explained her responsibilities in a letter that makes it clear that she was trying to protect the integrity of the Justice Department by not jumping to defend an order without all the facts. My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts. In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful. This is particularly scary because once Trump has full control of the Justice Department he will cripple it and no amount of protests or lawsuits will prevent him from doing so. We may even lose the power to oust Trump via elections. As long as Trump is allowed to solidify his power, no election will ever be fair and free again. And he will use the Justice Department to make sure of it, which means we will have no legal means to save democracy.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,31-Jan-17
" Madeleine Albright SLAMS Trump For Muslim Ban, Makes STUNNING Suggestion That Could Save Us All (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s executive order to ban travelers from Muslim-majority countries has been met with an onslaught of criticism.One of the people continuing to speak out against Trump is former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who slammed Trump in an interview with Chris Cuomo earlier today. Criticizing Trump s ban and the team that helped move it forward, Albright made a suggestion that could save America from this doomed, terrifying presidency: It would be helpful if the people at the top of our government actually read the Constitution. Because clearly, Trump knows nothing about it. Albright smacked down Trump s  unprepared plan , stating that what he was doing was actually putting America in danger instead of making  America Safe Again.  She said: It has actually created more danger. Because there are countries that are now, in fact, not able to cooperate with us in terms of intelligence sharing or generally mistrust, and there s going to be tit for tat, where we have troops in Iraq and we have to worry how they are going to be treated. Albright also stated that Trump created chaos and turmoil not only within the U.S., but on an international level as well. I think it s one of the worst decisions. And then blaming a whole religion for this is truly outrageous and un-American. I think the question is, there s danger in the world, no question about it, but all the facts that you have been presenting in terms of who are the ones that commit terrorist attacks, it s not people that come from those seven countries. Albright posed the critical question: why weren t the countries that are actually a danger on the banned list? She stated that Trump s ban was  not based on facts    because no refugee has actually attacked the U.S. in over 40 years. Trump didn t even put the countries that the 9/11 hijackers came from on the list. Albright said: There are lots of questions that have not been answered. Part of what really bothers me is that this country is based on diversity and respecting diverse opinions. What is happening is that this administration is making decisions based on the decisions of people that are uninformed about what is going on in the world. Albright herself was a refugee, having escaped then-Czechoslovakia shortly after Nazi occupation started. Her parents were Jewish and she lost many family members due to the Holocaust. Albright condemned Trump for leaving Jews out of his Holocaust Remembrance Day proclamation. She said: I think that it was really unbelievable, in terms of what day it was issued, on Holocaust Memorial Day, and not to understand the suffering. By the way, that one of the things people remember about the United States is that during the 1930s a ship of Jews was turned away from America. Is that the things we want to remember is how we turn people away from this country when they need help? You can watch Albright crush Trump below:Just a few days ago, Albright stood in solidarity with Muslims and said she was  ready to register as Muslim. We need more voices like Albright s to fight the tyranny that America has just come under.Featured image via Jessica Kourkounis / Getty Images",News,31-Jan-17
" BREAKING: Trump DEVASTATED, Drops Anti-LGBT Executive Order After Facing Public Outrage (DETAILS)","If the halting of Donald Trump s disgusting Muslim ban was any indication, Trump is quickly learning that the American people will do whatever it takes to stop his tyranny from infringing upon the true values of America and the constitutional rights of every citizen.Recently, the Trump administration tried to move forward with an executive order attacking LGBTQ rights, and was forced to drop it after America responded with an onslaught of backlash and criticism. Facing immediate public outcry, the White House released a statement: President Donald J. Trump is determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the LGBTQ community. President Trump continues to be respectful and supportive of LGBTQ rights, just as he was throughout the election. The President is proud to have been the first ever GOP nominee to mention the LGBTQ community in his nomination acceptance speech, pledging then to protect the community from violence and oppression. The executive order signed in 2014, which protects employees from anti-LGBTQ workplace discrimination while working for federal contractors, will remain intact at the direction of President Donald J. Trump. Of course, the statement makes zero mention of the fact that Trump might create another executive order that would allow for workplace discrimination. However, Trump s draft of his halted executive order would have allowed employers to fire workers based on their sexual orientation, and would have allowed federally funded adoption and social service agencies to discriminate against the LGBT community. Federal employees would have also been able to refuse service to LGBT individuals. With that being said, it s hilarious that the White House s statement talks about how  respectful  and  supportive  Trump is when it comes to LGBT rights. But regardless, we re just fortunate that he s been stopped in his tracks.Trump s tyranny is terrifying, but one small silver lining that shouldn t be forgotten is the fact that he is so thin-skinned and sensitive. His narcissism and desperate need for approval make him more easily swayed to public pressure, and public protests bother him more than anything else. The media was swift in reporting Trump s executive order draft before he could sign it, and the public worked just as fast to express outrage. This takes away significant power from Trump, as it is truly humiliating for him to receive so much backlash on the world stage. We need to keep this momentum going, and build upon the resistance we ve already seen   because it is working.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,31-Jan-17
" BUSTED: Trump’s Education Nominee Plagiarized, Which Students Are Taught Not To Do","How can we expect our kids to do their homework when the nominee for the top education post in the nation won t even bother doing her own homework?A Senate questionnaire is not exactly difficult to fill out. You provide your own answers to the questions asked and then your answers are evaluated by the committee tasked with considering your nomination.It s easy for anyone who is intelligent and hard-working.But rather than present her own work, Secretary of Education nominee Betsy DeVos chose to just copy and paste her answers verbatim from other sources without citations.According to the Washington Post,In answering a set of questions from Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) on how she would address bullying of LGBT students, DeVos wrote:  Every child deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment where they can learn, thrive, and grow. That sentence is almost identical to language used by Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department s civil rights division under President Barack Obama, in a news release announcing the administration s controversial guidance to schools on how to accommodate transgender students. Every child deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment that allows them to thrive and grow,  Gupta said in the May 2016 release.Oh, and that s not all. DeVos also copied directly from the the department she wants to destroy.In one response, to a question about whether she would continue the practice of publishing a list of schools under Title IX civil rights investigations, DeVos said,  Opening a complaint for investigation in no way implies that the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has made a determination about the merits of the complaint. That language mirrors an Education Department website:  Opening a complaint for investigation in no way implies that OCR has made a determination with regard to the merits of the complaint. DeVos committed plagiarism throughout the 62-page questionnaire. Apparently, she was too lazy to make a real effort. It s either that or she s just not smart enough to answer easy questions. Either way, plagiarism is something students are taught not to do in school and when they get caught they get punished for it by getting a failing grade on the assignment or even expulsion.But DeVos is not a student in school. She s an adult who is up for the top education post in the country. And frankly, that makes her plagiarism much worse and more embarrassing.She should immediately withdraw her name from the nomination or the Senate should reject her. It would be entirely inappropriate for the Secretary of Education to be someone who refuses to do their own homework in their own words. Surely, we want our Secretary of Education to be someone with integrity and real intelligence. Betsy DeVos has neither.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images ",News,31-Jan-17
 ‘We’re Getting Hammered’: GOP Lawmaker Feeling Pressure Over Obamacare Repeal (VIDEO),"Virginia Congressman Dave Brat is feeling the heat from his constituents, especially women. Republicans are moving to repeal Obamacare and his constituents are putting the pressure on him. Since Obamacare and these issues have come up, the women are in my grill no matter where I go,  he told a conservative audience at an event on Saturday.  They come up    When is your next town hall?  And believe me, it s not to give positive input. I had one woman on my Facebook say she was going to get up in my grill,  he said.  There s paid protesters   paid activists on the far left, not my Democratic friends I go to church with. They re being paid to go around and raise havoc. We re getting hammered,  Brat added.There is a Facebook page dedicated to the Virginia Republican which uses the hashtag #AskBrat so it doesn t appear that they re  paid. Karen Conley of Henrico County said she called Brat s office recently to express support for the Affordable Care Act, which keeps her family insured. Nobody is being paid or put up to this by an outside organization,  Conley said.  Everybody is putting in their time and effort because they re dissatisfied with the representation. They feel dismissed, and that their concerns aren t valid because they re not being responded to. It s not just a partisan issue anymore. Alsuin Preis, another of Brat s constituents, said many of the people who are trying to meet with the congressman had supported him during his campaign. This is not about going to a town hall about haranguing Dave Brat or just throwing out jabs,  Preis told WTVR-TV.  We want to discuss our concerns. Brat plans to hold town hall meetings after the first 100 days of the Donald Trump administration. Over the past couple of weeks my office has been inundated with phone calls, and emails and comments on social media requesting a town hall meeting, and believe me, I fully intend to have plenty of town halls that are open and transparent as soon as our first 100 days agenda is implemented and we come up for a breath of air,  Brat wrote on Facebook.Some of Brat s constituents are requesting a town hall meeting before the first 100 days of Trump s alleged presidency.Watch:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Dave Brat meets with District 1 at Hanover Tavern 1/28/17Thoughts?""When is the next Town Hall meeting?"" is not an accusation, it's a question.

" Trump Whines Because Democrats Are Blocking His Cabinet Nominees, Gets Informed That Karma Is A B*tch","Donald Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Monday and proceeded to whine about how Democrats are blocking his nominees. Twitter responded by teaching him about karma.For eight years, Republicans blocked many of President Obama s nominees, including one nominee who died waiting to be confirmed as the Ambassador to the Bahamas. Cassandra Butts waited for two long years and died without getting the opportunity to serve her country. And Republicans blocked President Obama s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court for almost a year before it expired due to the end of Obama s second term in office.This unprecedented obstruction has rallied Democrats to do the exact same thing to Trump, but Democrats have far better reasons to block Trump s nominees since they intend to help him destroy this country.One particular nominee Democrats are blocking is Jeff Sessions, whom Trump nominated as Attorney General. The problem is that Sessions is a racist who wants to cripple civil rights and voting rights and that will be easy to do if he is allowed to control the Justice Department.So Trump complained about the obstruction on Monday night and again on Tuesday morning.The Democrats are delaying my cabinet picks for purely political reasons. They have nothing going but to obstruct. Now have an Obama A.G.  Donald J.

 The Internet Just Ripped Trump APART For Firing ‘God Damned American Hero’ Sally Yates,"Acting Attorney General Sally Yates refused to back Donald Trump and his bigoted Muslim Ban. In a move that will surprise no one ever, Trump flew into a rage and fired her. Now, the internet is ripping him apart.In a brave act of defiance, Yates announced on Monday that The Department of Justice would not enforce his executive order as long as she was attorney general.Read the message Sally Yates left for Justice Department lawyers before she was fired: https://t.co/c8IE9NfUQX pic.twitter.com/NhECBjKJkp  Los Angeles Times (@latimes) January 31, 2017Trump went full on fascist and fired Yates for her insubordination, sending a clear message to all federal employees: obey me, or else. In a scathing statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Yates was basically branded a traitor. The statement accused her of having  betrayed  the DOJ and described her as an  Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on immigration. Tonight,  the statement read,  President Trump has relieved Ms. Yates of her duties. Instantly, people began referring to Yates  firing as the  Monday Night Massacre.  This is a reference to when Richard Nixon ordered a special prosecutor be fired for refusing to stop looking into the Watergate scandal. As a result, two of the DOJ s top leaders resigned rather obey the shameful order. That night in 1973 became known as the  Saturday Night Massacre. #MondayNIghtMassacre #TrumpFiresYates #FiredForSupportingTheConstitution Thank you @SallyQYates for your bravery. pic.twitter.com/wmFiEDFOE4  Warren Leight (@warrenleightTV) January 31, 2017#mondaynightmassacre: took Nixon 5 years, Trump- 8 days  Janet Reitman (@janetreitman) January 31, 2017Trump now finds himself being absolutely shredded in the court of public opinion yet again while Yates is being hailed a hero for standing strong against his bully tactics.Someone updated Sally Yates  Wikipedia page pic.twitter.com/BkPynP3h3w  Tim Perone (@timperone) January 31, 2017Sally Yates lived her oath like MLK.

 Trump’s Voter Fraud ‘Expert’ Just DISPROVED His Own Voter Fraud Argument In The Most Ironic Way Possible,"Ah, Trump and voter fraud. The subject that he can t let go because, on his warped planet, he s so beloved by everyone that there s no way he lost the popular vote. Donald Trump is just not a loser in any way, shape or form. So why is it that so many people around him are guilty or caught up in one of the things he himself decries: Being registered to vote in more than one state? His chief strategist, Steve Bannon, is guilty of that, which is bad enough.What s worse is that the person Trump is getting his  3 million people voted illegally and if it weren t for them I d have won everything  information from is likewise registered to vote in multiple states.The Associated Press has learned that Gregg Phillips, who praised True the Vote for allegedly uncovering  thousands of duplicate records and registrations of dead people,  is registered to vote in Alabama, Texas, and Mississippi. Three states.This is proof that voter fraud is rampant? Har de har har don t make us laugh too hard. It hurts.Now,  Gregg Phillips  isn t exactly a unique name. What the AP found, though, was that all three of these registrations had identical Social Security numbers. That makes it a little harder to claim that these registrations are to three different people who all happen to have the same name.This is the guy who tweeted, back in November, that he had evidence of three million people voting illegally and then never provided or published said evidence, but Trump jumped on it anyway, which is dangerous as hell.Phillips is on Twitter now, pretending that it s voter fraud in every case except for his:AP just wrote and said I am still registered to vote in MS, a place I haven t lived for 20 years. Makes my point, elections are broken.  Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) January 30, 2017While that s a fair point, what Phillips totally fails to mention (because of course he does) is that it also illustrates the fact that being registered to vote in multiple states isn t indicative of voter fraud at all. Instead, it shows that the states aren t psychic. Most people registered to vote in multiple states didn t do that intentionally   they moved away (or died) and the states didn t realize that.All these people vote multiple times except for the two anal pustules known as Trump and Phillips.Sure. Right. There is no proof there, and if Trump wants to pretend there is, then he s got to find better evidence than one man who s registered to vote in three states.Trump and his little bestie here (at least, insofar as voter fraud is concerned) need to shut their goddamn mouths on this once and for all.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images",News,30-Jan-17
" Fox News Rushes To ID Mosque Attacker As Moroccan Muslim — He’s A White, Christian, Nazi Trump Fan (TWEETS)","Want evidence that Fox News is a functional mouthpiece for the Trump administration? On Monday, the most watched news network in America lied to you. While it may see shocking that an American news agency would push blatant lies, they seem to have had a direct source  the Trump White House.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer kicked off his press conference by claiming (falsely) that the attacker was both a Muslim and from Morocco.  It s a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant and why the President is taking steps to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to our nation s safety and security, Spicer said at this afternoon s briefing when speaking of the Quebec City attack.Fox News reported the same information despite that it was never confirmed, tweeting it out in an almost celebratory fashion:Naturally, things got a bit embarrassing for the network   and Spicer, who is already dealing with the aftermath of saying that it s not only right but necessary to handcuff 5-year-old Muslim children and treat them like terrorists   when information surfaced that he wasn t from Morocco or a Muslim. In fact, he s a huge fan of Donald J. Trump:The actual shooting suspect is 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonnette, a white French Canadian who is, by all appearances, a rabid anti-immigrant nationalist. A leader of a local immigration rights groups, Fran ois Deschamps, told a local paper he recognized his photo as an anti-immigrant far-right  troll  who has been hostile to the group online. And Bisonnette s Facebook page   now taken down but still archived  lists among its  likes  the far right French nationalist Marine Le Pen, Islam critics Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, the Israeli Defense Forces, and Donald J. Trump (he also  likes  the liberal Canadian Party NDP along with more neutral  likes  such as Tom Hanks, the Sopranos and Katy Perry).Fox News responded by changing a few lines in their original report and never actually issuing a retraction or apology. In fact, as of 7:06 P.M. EST, the tweet is still live:Suspect in Quebec mosque terror attack was of Moroccan origin, reports show https://t.co/oRzxGHEXDm pic.twitter.com/aEsEtccMvi  Fox News (@FoxNews) January 30, 2017While it is true that police did question a Moroccan man, the guy was a worshiper and a witness to the attack   not a suspect as conservatives have been saying. In fact, as the person who called the cops in the first place, he was never treated by police as anything other than a witness. Conservative media, on the other hand, just went with it.Naturally, Fox News, Spicer, and all who believed their wacky story found themselves facing, well, quite a bit of mockery for this desperate attempt to blame the deadly attack on Muslims:Fox News was only tryin' to be polite givin' the Moroccan suspect top billin'. Bissonnette liked Trump and Le Pen on Facebook. pic.twitter.com/S1a3tuQhwK  Tea Pain (@TeaPainUSA) January 30, 2017The Moroccan man who people ran with as the suspect was actually a worshipper and witness.

 Trump Just Told Prince Charles To Eat Sh*t For An Absolutely RIDICULOUS Reason,"Donald Trump is slated to visit Great Britain this summer, and meet with Prince Charles while he s there. And the White House warned Prince Charles to avoid  lecturing  Trump on issues like climate change:Members of Trump s inner circle have warned British officials that it would be counterproductive for Charles to  lecture  Trump on green issues during the president s June visit to Britain, and that the president will  erupt  if pushed, the Sunday Times of London reported.Well, isn t that a nice way of telling Prince Charles to fuck off if he brings up climate change. One could even take that to be some kind of veiled threat, but it s more likely that came from Trump needing to feel like he knows everything about everything and doesn t need to be educated on anything.Trump is a known climate-denier and also has, ahem, a tendency to fly off the handle when anyone tries to tell him he s wrong, he screwed up, or basically doesn t kiss his boots and his ass. He still hasn t grasped the fact that he s the least popular person to assume the highest office in our nation, let alone that people won t immediately acknowledge his amazing intelligence and understanding of the world.He s been looking to pull the U.S. out of the big Paris climate accord as quickly as possible, even looking for ways to circumvent the four-year process for withdrawing. He believes that environmental regulations are harmful to business and that we must do away with them. He wants to do away with them so badly he scrubbed all mention of climate change from the White House s website the instant he was sworn in, and started gagging federal agencies directly involved with environmental issues to boot.Prince Charles, however, has not ruled out bringing the subject up, even though he ll probably try and work to avoid the appearance of  lecturing.  Sadly, though, Trump will probably see any talk that doesn t fit his views to a tee as  lecturing. The White House is treating Prince Charles like he s the egotistical know-it-all who should shut up and listen. But what can we expect from an administration that openly and loudly calls for members of the press to be fired for reporting facts they don t like?Photo of Prince Charles by Arthur Edwards -WPA Pool/Getty Images.

 MAJOR Republican Celebrity Turns On Trump; Fans SHOCKED (TWEETS),"It s not tough to imagine that NASCAR races have their share of Donald Trump s  Make America Great Again  caps. Your stereotypical NASCAR is a, as we re told by Fox News and those on the right, real American with real American values, which means no tolerance for those people from other places. A funny thing happens, though, even in NASCAR circles, nearly every American is a product of immigration so some surprising people are taking Trump s Muslim ban very seriously. NASCAR star Dale Earnhardt Jr. is one of them.Earnhardt has been at the top of his sport for years when it comes to fans. For the last 14 years, he has won most popular driver, every single year. Donald Trump is also a big favorite with the NASCAR crowd and the drivers were mostly happy with Trump s electoral victory. Still, while Earnhardt is hardly a Democratic Socialist (he is a Republican), his politics do skew a little to the left of Trump (of course, these days, Mussolini s politics skew a little to the left of Trump).In 2006, Earnhardt was the only NASCAR driver to answer a question about his support of the Confederate flag. He didn t support it. He called it racist. I guess with popularity comes the courage to drive a different direction and over the weekend, he criticized the Trump administration s Muslim ban on Twitter.Unlike Trump, Earnhardt seems to have a grasp on how our country was built   on the backs of immigrants:@GelarBudidarma my fam immigrated from Germany in 1700s escaping religious persecution. America is created by immigrants.  Dale Earnhardt Jr. (@DaleJr) January 29, 2017Reactions were mixed, but a lot more nuanced than if the message had come from someone who s considered a  libtard.

 Stephen King’s New Metaphor For Trump Is Going VIRAL; Trump Will Be FURIOUS (TWEET),"If there s one thing Donald Trump hates, it s being criticized and told he s not good at his job. He has a very fragile ego which, in turn, prevents him from leading properly, because if you re not able to accept criticism or advice and grow from it, you re never going to be able to efficiently lead. Being president needs to be about what s best for the people, not what s best for the current mood of the man in charge.Pointing out how damaging Trump is already being to the United States is none other than the legendary author Stephen King. In a viral tweet, he describes Trump with a perfect metaphor.King tweeted out: Imagine a hooligan pouring sugar into the gas tank of an expensive and well-maintained car. Trump is that hooligan. America is that car. Imagine a hooligan pouring sugar into the gas tank of an expensive and well-maintained car. Trump is that hooligan. America is that car.  Stephen King (@StephenKing) January 29, 2017And he s exactly right. In fact, describing Trump as merely a hooligan may be far too kind. Trump s destructive and bigoted behavior is going to lead the United States down a very dark path. Just like pouring sugar in a gas tank will destroy a car, Trump s plans for the nation will subsequently destroy everything that has made America great.Undoubtedly, Trump will be furious that King made such a criticism of his behavior. Who knows, maybe King will even get an infantile tweet storm thrown directly at him.Hopefully, Congress, SCOTUS, the ACLU, the media, etc. will hold Trump accountable for all the horrendous things he has already done and plans to do.Featured Photo by This Robinson, Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,30-Jan-17
" Arnold Schwarzenegger DESTROYS Trump For Muslim Ban, Making America ‘Look Stupid’ (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s disgusting Muslim ban is being criticized far and wide, as protests and petitions against it have sprung up not only all over the country, but all over the world.One of Trump s own peers, Celebrity Apprentice host Arnold Schwarzenegger, has just weighed in on Trump s ban, and it s particularly brutal. Schwarzenegger himself was once in immigrant   as many of us were   and he added his thoughts about what is truly an unjust, vile way to express hatred and xenophobia.In an interview with Mario Lopez, Schwarzenegger bashed Trump and his administration s incompetent and humiliating rollout of his executive order on immigration, which only led to chaos and public outcry. Schwarzenegger, the former governor of California, stated that Trump s ban was  vetted badly  and that  there is another way to going about it to do it the right way and accomplish all of the goals. I think they were hasty with it. Schwarzenegger then gave his own personal experience of immigrating to the United States in 1968 and shamed Trump for his clumsy delivery. He said: To go and to ban people that have a green card that means that the United States of America has given you permission to work here permanently in this country and you are on the way to permanent citizenship I was in that position  It s crazy, it s crazy and makes us look stupid when the White House is ill-prepared to put these kind of executive orders out there. Schwarzenegger said he hoped Trump and his moronic helpers would learn from this incident and use it as a  wake-up call . Judging from the amount of protests and outcry that was generated from Trump s Muslim ban, America will only stand for more inclusive policies.

" Trump’s Muslim Ban Has One MAJOR Cheerleader That Is Very, Very Dangerous (DETAILS)","While most of the free world, including the majority of Americans, are horrified by Donald Trump s order banning Muslims, there is one group of individuals very excited for it   Islamic Jihad.Trump s order only proves to cement their theory to those they are trying to recruit that the United States hates Islam. It is a theory that holds no basis in reality, but Trump is playing right into their hands.According to The Washington Post: Comments posted to pro-Islamic State social media accounts predicted that President Trump s executive order would persuade American Muslims to side with the extremists. One posting hailed the U.S. president as  the best caller to Islam,  while others predicted that Trump would soon launch a new war in the Middle East.Further: [Islamic State leader Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi has the right to come out and inform Trump that banning Muslims from entering America is a  blessed ban,  said one posting to a pro-Islamic State channel on Telegram, a social-media platform. The writer compared the executive order to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which Islamic militant leaders at the time hailed as a  blessed invasion  that ignited anti-Western fervor across the Islamic world. With former CIA official Robert Richer, who served as  deputy chief of the agency s Operations Directorate during the George W. Bush administration,  saying: This was a win for jihadists and other anti-U.S. forces. It fuels the belief out there that Americans are anti-Islam. Otherwise, it accomplishes nothing, because the ones we are most concerned about can still get to the United States. Trump s order is purely dangerous political posturing to not only the United States but the world. It does nothing to combat the threat of Islamic extremism and only serves to help ISIS and other extremist jihad groups to recruit. Trump made the order without going through the proper channels of advice, and apparently it wasn t even discussed with his Secretary of Homeland Security.Trump is proving to be the danger we all knew he would be before getting elected (by Electoral College only) and hopefully, Congress will take the proper actions to stop him at every turn.Featured Photo by Andrew Harrer   Pool/Getty Images",News,30-Jan-17
 Darrell Issa: Trump’s Muslim Ban Is OK Because ‘This Happens’ To ‘People Of This Color’ Daily (VIDEO),"GOP Congressman Darrell Issa offered the most disgusting defense of Trump s Muslim ban one could imagine. During an appearance on  FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS FAKE NEWS  CNN Monday, Issa was asked if white supremacist piece of shit Steve Bannon wrote the executive order that caused thousands and thousands of people to rise up in opposition to Trump.Issa explained that he isn t sure Bannon wrote the order (it has since been blamed on a close friend of influential Nazi Richard Spencer, who recently got punched in the face in a video that went viral), but explained that The president is trying to react to a crisis that has been ongoing for a period of time.  According to Issa, Democrats are to blame for not confirming Trump s pro-Putin, Muslim ban-supporting Secretary of State pick Rex Tillerson quickly enough. That s deflection,  CNN s Carol Costello replied.  Should he have waited, then, for the secretary of state to be confirmed (so) he could have consulted with Rex Tillerson?  Issa pointed out that Barack Obama took a parting shot at ISIS< bombing militants as he exited the White House because that is totally the same as banning people because they come from a country that Trump thinks has too many Muslims. Your are the president every day you re the president,  Issa says. According to the Hillary Clinton witch hunter, the Muslim ban is fine because this sort of bigoted discrimination  happens every day with to people of this color.  Issa pointed to his own face in an effort to make the point that white people sometimes are asked to step aside for additional screening (something that is normal for Muslims with darker complexions).There you have it, folks. White people sometimes have to deal with a small amount of additional bother at airports, so it s perfectly fine to detain people because of their religion. Nothing to see here, move along.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab",News,30-Jan-17
 Spicer: It Would Be ‘Misguided And Wrong’ To NOT Handcuff 5-Year-Old Muslim Children (VIDEO),"There was a time when a brutal dictator would strip children from their parents, handcuffing and detaining them simply because of their religion. It was a shameful time in our world s history that we must be careful not to repea oh, this happened over the f*cking weekend?If you haven t seen it yet, one incident stemming from the chaos caused by Trump s Muslim ban perfectly demonstrates how far we have fallen. On Saturday, a 5-year-old U.S. citizen was stripped from his family thanks to President Asterisk s Muslim ban. The Maryland boy was traveling to Washington Dulles airport with another family member to meet his mother, who is from Iran, when they were stopped and the child was handcuffed and detained for hours. The Huffington Post reports:A 5-year-old boy who was swept up in President Donald Trump s executive order was reunited with his mother Saturday after enduring a several-hour detention, emotional video shows.The little boy, who U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) identified as a U.S. citizen and Maryland resident, was seen being showered with kisses as his mother embraced him at Washington D.C. s Dulles International Airport, WJZ-TV reported.The child s mother, who is reportedly from Iran, declined an interview as she rushed out of the airport. Family surrounding the mother and son meanwhile clutched balloons and sang  Happy Birthday  to the boy, who had been flying with another family member.But not to worry. On Monday, White House press secretary assured us that this would never happen again   just kidding, he doubled down on the decision to treat a 5-year-old U.S. citizen like a terrorist. To assume someone because of their age or gender, that they don t pose a threat, would be misguided and wrong,  Spicer said during a press conference when asked about the situation.If you thought there would be any repentance over the disaster that was this past weekend, you were also  misguided and wrong.  The United States has entered a terrifying time in its history, one we can only survive if we stick together and continue to stand up for the oppressed   including those who are too small to be heard on their own.Fuck you, Spicer.

 Trump Executive Order Mandates Two Regulation Cuts For Every New One Created,"Donald Trump is literally ordering the government to take two steps back for every step forward.Regulations protect the American people. There are regulations that give us clean water and clean air, regulations that keep workers safe at work with fair wages, regulations that prevent dangerous or poisonous products from being sold to consumers, regulations that keep our food safe, regulations that protect us from predatory banking, and regulations that protect endangered species. And those are just the tip of the iceberg. Without regulations, companies could pollute whenever and wherever they want. Our country would be a disaster. There s a reason why we have regulations.But Donald Trump promised during his first week to kill 75 percent of regulations.  The regulations are going to be cut massively,  he said during a meeting with corporate CEOs on his third full day in office last week.And now he is following through by signing an executive order that requires federal agencies to kill two existing regulations for every new one created and guts funding for new regulations for the entire year.According to Reuters,Trump plans to sign an executive order on Monday that will require that for every new federal regulation proposed, two must be revoked, an administration official said.The order says federal agencies will propose rules they want to eliminate and the White House will review those decisions. The order sets a budget of $0 for new regulations in 2017 and the administration will set a regulation budget each year.Basically, Trump s cabinet could propose a useless regulation and then use it as an excuse to cut two crucial regulations like a food safety rule or rules that regulate pollution.While there surely are regulations that could be loosened to help small business owners, waging total war against regulations and mandating that two be repealed for every new one created is completely asinine and does nothing but hurt the American people and take the country backwards.Again, most regulations on the books were created for a reason and need to remain to protect the environment, our health, and our lives.This is not a game, but Donald Trump sure seems to think it is.Featured image via Shawn Thew-Pool/Getty Images",News,30-Jan-17
" WATCH: Kellyanne Conway Loses Her Sh*t On Fox News, Demands Media Fire All Trump Critics","This is what it looks like when the Wicked Witch throws a temper tantrum.In addition to calling the worldwide chaos a  small price to pay  to keep America safe, Conway went on a long rant against the media on Sunday during an interview with Fox News host Chris Wallace, who let Trump s adviser hang herself rather than save her from humiliating herself.Conway whined about media criticism of Trump and demanded that people who criticize Trump be fired. Who is cleaning house? Which one is going to be the first network to get rid of these people, the people who think things were just not true, it happened last week. Talk about  alternative facts. I went on three network shows and spoke for 35 minutes on three network Sunday shows. You know what got picked? The fact that I said  alternative facts,  not the fact that I ripped a new one to some of those hosts that they never cover the facts that matter. The 16.1 million women in poverty, the 12.4 million who have no health insurance. Everyone should be outraged Of course, Conway conveniently ignored that by repealing the Affordable Care Act her boss is stripping healthcare away from 30 million Americans and will cause millions of Americans to fall into poverty. But she doesn t seem to have a problem with that at all.Oh, but that wasn t the end of her rant. Conway continued to bitch about headlines and demanded that people be fired.We have all the headlines   someone should be embarrassed.Not one network person has been let go. Not one silly political analyst and pundit who talked smack all day long about Donald Trump has been let go. They are panels every Sunday, they are on cable news every day.Who is the first editorial writer? Who is the first blogger that will be left out, that embarrassed him at outlets. We know their names. I m too polite to mention their names, but they know who they are, and they are all wondering who will be the first to go. The election was three months ago. None of them have been let go.If the mainstream media were a thriving private sector business that actually turned a profit, which is not true of many newspapers, 20% of the people would be gone. They embarrassed, they failed to protect their shareholders and the board members and their colleagues.And yet we deal with him every single day. We turn the other cheek. If you are part of team Trump, you walk around with these gaping, seeping wounds every day, that s fine. I m here every Sunday morning. I haven t slept in in a month.Conway literally attacked the free press for reporting accurately on Trump and the things he has been doing since taking office. And considering all those horrible things it s a wonder that Conway is able to actually sleep at night at all.Here s the video via Real Clear Politics.Reporters should not be fired for doing their jobs. Conway and Trump want to force the press to say nothing but good things about them. The problem is that Trump has done nothing but destroy America and ignore American values. Demanding that the media fire Trump critics is the same as demanding censorship and demanding that the media lie for you. That should not happen in a nation where the free press is guaranteed by the Constitution.Featured image via screenshot",News,30-Jan-17
 WATCH: George Stephanopoulos SHREDS Kellyanne Conway With Facts About Trump’s Muslim Ban,"Kellyanne Conway tried to baffle George Stephanopoulos with bullshit on Monday morning and got her ass handed to her with facts.Donald Trump s Muslim ban has caused worldwide chaos as airports across the country are detaining and blocking people traveling from seven countries, including green card holders who are permanent American citizens, children, and the elderly. For some reason, Trump and his team think these people are terrorism threats.But the ban not only violates constitutional rights, it is absolutely wrong about the seven countries listed because none of them are responsible for any deaths on American soil.And during an interview with George Stephanopoulos, Conway took a beating after she claimed that protesters against Trump s ban don t know the facts. I see all these protesters,  Conway whined.  I think if you actually surveyed them, they would probably get the facts wrong. They re being misinformed. Stephanopoulos then unleashed devastating facts, pointing out that Saudia Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates were left off the list even though those countries were home to the 9/11 hijackers. Trump mentioned 9/11 as a reason for the executive order. None of the deadly terror attacks in this country since 9/11 have been carried out by anyone from those seven countries. Eighteen of the 19 9/11 attackers came from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates   there is no ban from that country. Those countries also happen to be countries where President Trump has significant business interests. So why weren t those countries included? Conway responded by blaming President Obama, claiming that Obama banned Iraqi refugees for six months.But that s a lie because it appears there was only a delay in processing visa applications of Iraqi refugees in response to an actual threat. But there was no ban like Conway claims. Stephanopoulos even pointed out the inaccurate claim and informed Conway that there was a lot of media coverage at the time.Conway then whined about not getting bipartisan cooperation, which is quite hypocritical to expect since Republicans refused to work with President Obama for eight years. She also demanded that Democrats and Republicans collaborate with Trump on his tyrannical agenda, which she called an  extraordinary accomplishment. I mean, Donald Trump has been on the job for, what, eight, nine, ten days. Barack Obama was here for eight years. The extraordinary accomplishments in just the first week truly are breathtaking. No reductive curating reporting, in my view, is helpful to the American public to understand. We re being very collaborative and very open. We would just like the same in return.

 Trump Blames Computer Failure For Worldwide Chaos He Caused With Muslim Ban,"In yet another morning rant, Donald Trump blamed anyone and anything but himself for the constitutional crisis and global chaos caused by his Muslim ban.On Friday, Trump signed an executive order banning travelers from seven countries where Trump thinks terrorists come from. However, the countries listed are not responsible for any deaths on American soil, unlike Saudi Arabia, where the 9/11 attackers were from and received their funding.Trump s ban has caused chaos at airports around the world as thousands of people have been detained, even children, the elderly, and permanent American citizens who hold green cards.It s a nightmare that could have been avoided simply by not being racist dick.But Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to defend his ban.Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world   a horrible mess!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017And on Monday, he decided to blame a computer system, protesters, and Senator Chuck Schumer for the chaos and claimed that  bad dudes  would have rushed into the country had he given the world time to prepare for the order.Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage, ..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer. Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. This was a big part of my campaign. Study the world!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the  bad  would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad  dudes  out there!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017Except that  bad dudes  would not have been able to  rush  into our country because our system of vetting is already the best in the world, which is why it can take up to two years for someone to immigrate here. Also, the  bad dudes  who committed the mass shootings in Orlando, Ft. Hood, and San Bernardino that Trump points to in order to justify his ban were all born in America. So unless Trump is capable of finding out whether babies are bad or good, he has no justification for the ban.Also, blaming machines and other people for the chaos your executive order is causing is very weak. The Delta computer outage occurred late Sunday, nearly two full days after the executive order was signed. Protesters and Senator Schumer were not responsible for the many people who were detained or blocked from entering this country to reunite with family. That included two Christian families from Syria who were sent back to the war-torn country where they face persecution and possible death despite Trump promising that Christian refugees would not be impacted by the ban.Twitter users were quick to pound Trump into oblivion..@realDonaldTrump You re the President, not a Ninja Turtle.

 WATCH: Actors At SAG Awards BLAST Trump’s Muslim Ban; Show What REAL American Patriotism Is,"Everyone is rightfully outraged at the Executive Order signed by Donald Trump that has left refugees and other immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries in limbo   and even in dangers. It has ripped families apart and sent a signal around the world that America is hostile to Muslims. Trump s ban is unconstitutional, and, more importantly, un-American. It goes against everything this nation stands for.Well, aside from the massive protests at airports around the world resisting Trump s fascist and bigoted ban, he has a new set of opponents   the actors at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards. At Sunday night s ceremony, actor after actor used their stage time to tell immigrants and refugees that they are welcome in our America. It started with Ashton Kutcher, who welcomed everyone viewing the show, and then extended that welcome to include everyone at airports that belong in my America.  Kutcher then continued: You are apart of the fabric of who we are and we love you and we welcome you. Lily Tomlin reminded everyone that the Doomsday Clock is now closer than ever to midnight thanks to Trump, and said: The Doomsday Clock has been moved to two and a half minutes before midnight. And this award came just in the nick of time. Mahershala Ali of Moonlight fame told a moving tale of how his mother resisted his conversion to Islam, but how it has now deepened and strengthened their loving bond: But I tell you now, we put things to the side and I m able to see her. She s able to see me. We love each other. The love has grown. Julia Louis-Dreyfus s story was the most chilling of all, considering where we are, as her father came to America to escape certain death at the hands of the Nazis when they took over France. She says of her American experience: I m an American patriot, and I love this country. Because I love this country, I am horrified by its blemishes, and this immigrant ban is a blemish and it s un-American. This is just the beginning, to be sure. Everyone knows that this Muslim ban is just like what happened during Hitler s reign and so many other horrors in our world s history. History is repeating itself. If the United States had not sent Ann Frank back, she d be 77 years old today, and would be a proud American. What Trump is doing is exactly what happened during World War II. America surely has blood on its hands as a result of Trump s bigotry.These actors are doing the right thing and standing up for what is right, for what upholds our beautiful American values. Donald Trump will never destroy that, no matter how many of these people become the subject of his Twitter ire.#RESIST.Watch Ashton Kutcher s opening remarks below:[ad3media campaign= 1429 ]Featured image via Kevork Djansezian/WireImage",News,30-Jan-17
" Trump Hotels Asked For People’s Favorite Travel Memories, And Twitter LIT THEM UP (TWEETS)","It s always interesting when people decide to use social media to point out how ridiculous someone or something is. Such was the case with Trump Hotels, where someone dredged up an old tweet asking people for their favorite travel memories. People angry about Trump s Muslim ban and other executive orders decided to use that tweet to, ahem, vent, and it s pretty epic.People tweeted that their favorite travel memory was staying with a competing hotel chain, others talked about President Obama, and still others tweeted about visiting family and friends who are immigrants. Still others pointed out hospitality in other countries, or with what overseas AirBNBs are doing.If Trump saw this, he d be pacing back and forth in the White House, grousing about how people need to be reminded of how beloved he is.In short, it didn t go very well for Trump Hotels. But it went amazingly good for anyone who stands against Trump and his dangerous, white supremacist agenda.

 BREAKING: House Dems Demand ‘Emergency’ Meeting With DHS Over Trump’s Bigoted Muslim Ban,"Donald Trump should be coming to the realization that his Muslim ban may have been just a step too far. But in case he needs help figuring it out, Democrats are ready to help teach him a lesson.According to Politico, high-ranking lawmakers on numerous committees sent a letter to DHS Secretary John Kelly on Sunday night. They demanded that he hold an  emergency  meeting to discuss Trump s unlawful executive order banning Muslims from entering the United States. As ranking members of the committees of jurisdiction for matters of immigration, border security, and admission of refugees, we write to you on an emergency basis to request a meeting to discuss the implementation and guidance concerning the Executive Order,  the congressmen wrote.The letter was reportedly signed by  House Judiciary Committee ranking member John Conyers (D-Mich.), Homeland Security ranking member Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), top Democrat on Judiciary s immigration panel. In their letter, the lawmakers pointed out that  only two days after the Order was signed, it is clear that it has already led to panic and disorder, not to mention protests. Lofgren intends to introduce legislation this week in an effort to fight Trump s bigoted ban. Unfortunately, Paul Ryan being the fickle fellow that he is, is now supporting Trump s order even though he denounced the idea of  religious tests  just six months ago. This means Logren s move will probably end up dead in the water.Democrats are asking Kelly to sit down with them no later than Wednesday. In addition, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi have both reached out to Kelly on their own.In the letter, the lawmakers also blasted DHS for accusations that customs officials have been denying legal counsel to detainees. Given the widespread chaos and confusion caused by the order   and the issuance of stays last evening concerning the Order by federal courts in New York, Virginia, and Massachusetts,  they wrote,  it is vital that we meet as soon as possible so that we may provide needed guidance and information to our committees and our constituents. House and Senate Democrats also intend to stage a protest in front of the Supreme Court at 6 p.m. on Monday night. The fight is only just beginning but Democrats intend to battle Trump s bigotry every step of the way. Some Dems have even said that they are  exploring all legal options, including an Amicus Brief in support of the ACLU. The letter concluded with the lawmakers telling Kelly that they  look forward to meeting with you in short order so that we can have an open and candid discussion about how the Trump administration arrived at this chaotic place, what you understand the meaning of the Executive Order to be, and what guidance you have offered to your employees and other stakeholders.

 CEO Of Starbucks Sends Giant F**K YOU To Trump In Groundbreaking Open Letter,"In what can only be seen as a groundbreaking and unprecedented move, Starbucks chairman and CEO Howard Schultz delivered an open letter to all their partners (employees) regarding Donald Trump s Muslim ban.He titled the letter,  Living Our Values In Uncertain Times  and here it is: Dear partners,I write to you today with deep concern, a heavy heart and a resolute promise. Let me begin with the news that is immediately in front of us: we have all been witness to the confusion, surprise and opposition to the Executive Order that President Trump issued on Friday, effectively banning people from several predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, including refugees fleeing wars. I can assure you that our Partner Resources team has been in direct contact with the partners who are impacted by this immigration ban, and we are doing everything possible to support and help them to navigate through this confusing period.We are living in an unprecedented time, one in which we are witness to the conscience of our country, and the promise of the American Dream, being called into question. These uncertain times call for different measures and communication tools than we have used in the past. Kevin and I are going to accelerate our commitment to communicating with you more frequently, including leveraging new technology platforms moving forward. I am hearing the alarm you all are sounding that the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack, and want to use a faster, more immediate form of communication to engage with you on matters that concern us all as partners.I also want to take this opportunity to announce specific actions we are taking to reinforce our belief in our partners around the world and to ensure you are clear that we will neither stand by, nor stand silent, as the uncertainty around the new Administration s actions grows with each passing day:Support for DACA: As I wrote to Senators Graham and Durbin this week, we are enthusiastically behind their work to support  Dreamers  across our country   including those young men and women who are part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. There are nearly three quarters of a million hardworking people contributing to our communities and our economy because of this program. At Starbucks, we are proud to call them partners and to help them realize their own American Dream. We want them to feel welcome and included in our success, which is why we reimburse them for the biennial fee they must pay to stay in the program and why we have offered DACA-related services at our Opportunity Youth hiring fairs.Hiring Refugees: We have a long history of hiring young people looking for opportunities and a pathway to a new life around the world. This is why we are doubling down on this commitment by working with our equity market employees as well as joint venture and licensed market partners in a concerted effort to welcome and seek opportunities for those fleeing war, violence, persecution and discrimination. There are more than 65 million citizens of the world recognized as refugees by the United Nations, and we are developing plans to hire 10,000 of them over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks does business. And we will start this effort here in the U.S. by making the initial focus of our hiring efforts on those individuals who have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel in the various countries where our military has asked for such support.Building Bridges, Not Walls, With Mexico: We have been open for business in Mexico since 2002, and have since opened almost 600 stores in 60 cities across the country, which together employ over 7,000 Mexican partners who proudly wear the green apron. We have sourced coffee from Mexico s producers and their families for three decades and last fall, we also announced the creation of a farmer support center in Chiapas to help accelerate our collective ability to grow and export some of the world s finest coffees from this important growing region, while donating more than $2 million to support the livelihood, food security and water quality of coffee producing communities in Oaxaca. With the support of thousands of Starbucks partners and millions of customers, we have also donated over a million coffee trees to support 70,000 families, and we will be expanding the initiative this year to generate another 4 million tree donations. Coffee is what unites our common heritage, and as I told Alberto Torrado, the leader of our partnership with Alsea in Mexico, we stand ready to help and support our Mexican customers, partners and their families as they navigate what impact proposed trade sanctions, immigration restrictions and taxes might have on their business and their trust of Americans. But we will continue to invest in this critically important market all the same.Our Healthcare Commitment to You: Finally, let me restate what we have recently communicated with you about the Affordable Care Act   our commitment remains that if you are benefits eligible, you will always have access to health insurance through Starbucks. Many of you have expressed concerns that recent government actions may jeopardize your ability to participate in the Affordable Care Act. If the recent Executive Order related to health care remains in place and the Affordable Care Act is repealed causing you to lose your healthcare coverage, you will always have the ability to return and can do so within 30 days of losing that coverage rather than having to wait for an open enrollment period. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Benefits Center at 877-728-9236.In the face of recent events around the world, let me assure you that we will stay true to our values and do everything we can possibly do to support and invest in every partner s well-being while taking the actions that are squarely within our ability to control. This is our focus: providing a Third Place of respite for those around the world who seek it, daily.Starbucks has and will always stand for opportunity   opportunity for our young people who are working to land their first job in the 75 countries where we do business, opportunity for our farmers who care so deeply for the highest of quality coffee we offer to customers all around the globe, and yes, opportunity for those who come to America in search of their own fresh start   whether that is with Starbucks directly, or through our suppliers or our partner companies.If there is any lesson to be learned over the last year, it s that your voice and your vote matter more than ever. We are all obligated to ensure our elected officials hear from us individually and collectively. Starbucks is doing its part; we need you to use the collective power of your voices to do the same while respecting the diverse viewpoints of the 90 million customers who visit our stores in more than 25,000 locations around the world.So, while we seek to understand what the new Administration s policies mean for us and our business both domestically and around the world, I can assure you that we will do whatever it takes to support you, our partners, to realize your own dreams and achieve your own opportunities. We are in business to inspire and nurture the human spirit, one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time   whether that neighborhood is in a Red State or a Blue State; a Christian country or a Muslim country; a divided nation or a united nation. That will not change. You have my word on that.Onward,Howard Well said, Mr. Schultz, and you are a better American for all that was said. Your dedication to what truly makes America the land of the free and the home of the brave will forever be noticed.Featured Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images",News,29-Jan-17
" #THERESISTANCE Is Working: Homeland Security Spits In Trump’s Face, Won’t Exclude Lawful Residents (DETAILS)","Over the weekend, the Trump Administration implemented one of their most terrifying campaign promises, the Muslim ban. He did it via Executive Order, and framed it as a  travel ban  from seven supposedly  dangerous  Muslim-majority countries. When Trump s hammer dropped, scores of people were detained and questioned for no good reason in airports and other ports of entry around the nation. Many were legal residents, green card holders, those with legal visas and refugee status, and other people who had been thoroughly vetted and had every right to enter this country without incident.The backlash was swift, as protests erupted organically and in massive numbers at major airports everywhere. The ACLU asked for lawyers to volunteer to help these people, and they did. Finally, U.S. District Court Judge Ann Donelly issued an emergency stay on Trump s racist travel ban, but it still took hours to get customs officers and border patrol agents to comply. Well, now Trump has been hit with another blow to his bigoted order, as Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly has issued a statement saying that those with legal residency will not be kept from entering this nation. The statement reads:WASHINGTON   In applying the provisions of the president s executive order, I hereby deem the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest.Accordingly, absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.So there, Trump. I dare you to try to go around Homeland Security and reverse this provision. What you and your administration are doing is unconstitutional, and, more importantly, it is un-American. Now, listen to the Homeland Security Secretary, and to everyone else who is telling you that this is unlawful and wrong, and stop this bullshit.Hopefully, if the sycophants around Trump won t pull the trigger and stop this madness, the Constitution will hold, and we can somehow stop this crazy agenda via the law. In the meantime, #RESIST.Featured image via Amanda Edwards/Getty Images",News,29-Jan-17
 Denver Police Officer Literally Tells Protesters To Stop Doing Anything That’s Free Speech,"Amidst protests all around the country against Trump s Muslim ban are local police departments ensuring that the protests don t get out of hand. One might think one has the right to protest anywhere as per the First Amendment, but apparently, not all police officers agree. In Denver, Police Commander Tony Lopez says that people can t protest at the airport without a permit.So, okay, a lot of places do that in order to maintain peace and public safety. Requiring a permit for gatherings over a certain size makes some sense. But the way he phrased it is shall we say a little strange: Stop doing anything that could be construed as free speech without a permit. There s no context in the video so it s hard to know what the situation was. However, even without the context, that s a strange and frankly alarming way to say that the roughly 120 or so protesters at Denver International Airport need a permit for their gathering.Lopez is also seen telling someone that he can t carry the Constitution around without a permit. Aren t there other ways to tell groups of people that they need a permit? Why phrase it that way? Even if the question he was asked was along the lines of,  We can t exercise our right to freedom of speech here?  there are other ways to explain than  stop doing anything that could be construed as free speech.

" Trump Press Secretary F*cks Up, Idiotically Retweets Satire Video Making Fun Of Him","The Trump administration has a Twitter problem. Donald Trump can t seem to control his narcissistic Twitter rants, but even his Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, is far too impulsive. He retweeted a video that he thought was a flattering portrayal, but the truth is, it was a satirical Onion video, and if he had watched till the end, he would realize it wasn t flattering at all.A good part of Spicer s job is to monitor the media. You would think he would read all the way through, or at least who the source was, but instead, Spicer tweeted,  You nailed it. Period!  to the Onion.The video, entitled  5 Things To Know About Sean Spicer,  should have let Spicer in on the joke in the very first item. It said his role in the Trump administration is  to provide the American public with robust and clearly articulated misinformation. Okay, perhaps he missed the  mis  in  misinformation.  Next?The second one was innocuous enough. It said he was formerly Senior Correspondent on NPR s national desk. Fair enough. Next?Clearly, Spicer didn t get to the third one because in that, the Onion called his speaking style  defensive. As for whether Spicer has lied to the press, the answer to #4 is possibly above most Trumpian s heads: One s own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of one s experience. The last one could be what Spicer was referring to when he said  nailed it!  The question was,  does he nail the pocket square or does he nail the pocket square. Spicer is almost as good at the pocket square as he is at  alternative facts,  so the Onion s answer was:Snowy white, quarter inch of clearance   you better believe he does.Oddly, that tweet is still up, but people aren t letting him forget it. Of course, as one Twitter user reminded us, Spicer also tweeted two passwords last week. In other words, he s clearly not too bright.You nailed it.

 Trump Voter Whines That Her Husband Can’t Get Back Into The Country (TWEETS),"When it comes to how horrible Donald Trump has been behaving with his actions, words, tweets and executive orders, we really can t be all that surprised. Trump was horrible throughout his entire campaign, and the majority of Americans picked up on that, which is why he lost the popular vote by close to three million votes.However, there were still some folks who had high hopes for Trump, despite the fact that he is behaving like the bigot and despot we already knew he would be.It would seem, though, that some of those people are finally starting to wake up   a little too late, mind you.One example of some of this regret was pointed out by a Twitter user:Life comes at you fast pic.twitter.com/e3DJvxSJtk  RJ (@SomeDudeRJ) January 29, 2017Here s Nicole super stoked for Trump back in September before the election:Image via TwitterHere s Nicole much less stoked for Trump after the reality of Trump s leadership kicked in:Image via TwitterIf she and so many like her had only listened to sanity and reason before the election, the popular vote winner, Hillary Clinton, would be president and everything would be absolutely fine, and she d probably be dining with her husband right now.Maybe Nicole will join the resistance movement and help to make sure Trump is held accountable for all his unconstitutionally horrible moves.Featured Photo by Sara D.

 Twitter F*cks Trump Up After He Says Senators Who Oppose Muslim Ban Are Trying To ‘Start World War III’ (TWEETS),"Trump has signed a stream of executive orders stripping federal funding from international, non-governmental health organizations that so much as mention abortion, authorizing a gigantic wall to keep brown people out of our country to create a gigantic  safe space  for his racist followers and authorizing concentration camps in which to keep the millions of immigrants he rounds up, and   in a move that literally mobilized the world against him   enacting a partial ban on Muslims entering the United States, including dual citizens, legal permanent residents, students, people with jobs, and others he considers dangerous.Even the most casual observer can see that Donald Trump s horrific policies are doing nothing but creating a destabilized environment not only in the United States, but worldwide.  On Sunday, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham released a joint statement warning that Trump s Muslim ban is a  self-inflicted wound  in the fight against terrorism. Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred,  the senators said  [Trump s] executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security. We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help,  the senators, added. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children. Trump could take this message to heart, pausing for a glorious moment of self-reflection, and apologize to the world for his actions. He could fire the white supremacists, Kremlin cronies, and imbeciles with which he has stacked his cabinet and replace them with people who will work for the good of the country, once and for all cementing himself as a true legend among world leaders. Trump could apologize to the Muslim community   but that s just not the guy he is.In a statement on Twitter, which is apparently where the President releases important information now, Trump responded to the senators  condemnation of his bigoted executive order, which was literally written by a white supremacist, by informing the world that McCain and Graham are trying to  start World War III  by saying that we shouldn t ban Muslims from our country.The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong   they are sadly weak on immigration.

 While The World Is Freaking The Hell Out Trump Is Watching ‘Finding Dory’,"Alleged President Donald Trump created worldwide chaos with his latest executive order banning Muslims from entering the U.S. Yes, it is a Muslim ban.  I ll tell you the whole history of it,  Giuliani said in an interview with Fox News  Jeanine Pirro.  When he first announced it, he said  Muslim ban.  He called me up. He said,  Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.  Of course, the ban isn t implemented in Muslim countries Trump does business with. Protests have erupted across the country for two days straight over Trump s highly controversial move. Travelers, including a 77-year-old woman and a 5-year-old boy were detained.So, what do you do when you re a newly minted president and you just created worldwide chaos? You watch  Finding Dory  while protesters are outside of the White House, angry over his reckless decision.Trump, along with family members and White House staff, screened the Disney Pixar film in the afternoon after prohibiting foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.Finding Dory is an animated story of a character s attempt to reunite with her parents despite outside forces working against her.The Internet was not amused.The nation is in turmoil over the Executive Order, and @POTUS @realDonaldTrump will be watching @findingdory. https://t.co/snpcZJuU2k  Derry London   (@Derry_London) January 29, 2017Meanwhile in the White House, Trump is watching  Finding Dory  with his unvetted staffers and their families. https://t.co/tLSoAhgh7g  Fernando Espuelas (@EspuelasVox) January 29, 2017If you wonder what Trump will be doing today during a potential constitutional crisis that he d have triggered   he s watching Finding Dory https://t.co/aX7GXzLwZj  Zachary Alfred (@ZacAlf) January 29, 2017And it s  Finding Dory.

 BREAKING: House Dems Have HAD IT With Trump And Are Fighting Back With Protests And Lawsuits (DETAILS),"House Democrats have had it with Donald Trump s unlawful Muslim ban and are planning to fight back against the bigoted executive order. To make their point loud and clear, they are planning to fight not just through legislation but are also staging a protest in front of the Supreme Court.According to a press release obtained by Addicting Info, Democrats are condemning Trump s Muslim ban as a betrayal of  everything the Statue of Liberty and our nation stand for  and insist that the order  is not only unconstitutional but immoral.  They have vowed to continue pressing for answers and are demanding  that the federal court injunction issued last night be honored. Proving just how important our efforts to resist as citizens really are, the statement said that lawmakers were  moved and inspired by the scenes of Americans, including Members of our Caucus, rallying to airports across the nation to demand justice for the men, women and children detained and/or deported under the President s order.  As a result, on Monday night at 6 p.m. Democratic House and Senate members  will gather for a press event in front of the steps of the Supreme Court to demand the President withdraw his disreputable executive order. We are witnessing an historic injustice unfold, and we must keep the pressure on,  said the release.In addition,  Immigration Subcommittee Ranking Member Zoe Lofgren and others will introduce legislation to rescind the Muslim ban  this week. Dems intend to continue reviewing the president s actions to determine if there are any other legal actions that can be taken to fight the bigoted ban.A high-level source tells Addicting Info that House Dems are engaging outside counsel to file an amicus brief against Trump s illegal Muslim Ban. We are also exploring all legal options, including an Amicus Brief in support of the ACLU,  the statement read. As Members of Congress, we take a solemn oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. Democrats intend to honor that oath by fighting the unconstitutional injustice of the President s Muslim ban. Donald Trump passed his bigoted and unconstitutional Muslim Ban on Friday. Over the weekend, people from the seven forbidden countries were detained and deported when they landed at U.S. airports. Widespread protests broke out and attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit. A temporary stay was granted by a federal judge but it does not seem that it is being followed as intended.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,29-Jan-17
" Senate Republicans Blast Donald Trump’s Racist, Dangerous Muslim Ban With Full Force","Public pressure is mounting on Congressional leaders after Donald Trump issued his racist, xenophobic, and idiotic executive order. The order, signed on Friday, bars refugees, immigrants or green card holders from entering the United States if they come from Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Iran, Sudan and Yemen.Shortly after the issue, plans arriving across the United States  busiest airports carrying Syrian families, international students, and dual-citizens were met with hostile authorities. Either sent back on the next flight out, detained for hours on end, and belittled by federal agents, Muslim refugees were subject to the wrath of Donald Trump.At first, only the Democrats (not surprisingly) spoke out. But as public outcry grew into spur-the-moment rallies across the United States, Republicans were forced to take notice.Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a centrist who refused to support Trump during the campaign, spoke out first, saying in a press release:The worldwide refugee ban set forth in the executive order is overly broad and implementing it will be immediately problematic. [It] could interfere with the immigration of Iraqis who worked for American forces in Iraq as translators and bodyguards   people who literally saved the lives of our troops and diplomats during the last decade and whose lives are at risk if they remain in Iraq  As I stated last summer, religious tests serve no useful purpose in the immigration process and run contrary to our American values.Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse, who refused to endorse Trump, lambasted the Administration for lacking  wisdom  with the action:There are two ways to lose our generational battle against jihadism by losing touch with reality. The first is to keep pretending that jihadi terrorism has no connection to Islam or to certain countries. That s been a disaster. And here s the second way to fail: If we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion. Both approaches are wrong, and both will make us less safe. Our generational fight against jihadism requires wisdomArizona Senator Jeff Flake, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and also refused to endorse Trump, blasted the executive action as  unacceptable,  saying:President Trump and his administration are right to be concerned about national security, but it s unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry. Enhancing long term national security requires that we have a clear-eyed view of radical Islamic terrorism without ascribing radical Islamic terrorist views to all Muslim.Arizona s other (and more hawkish) Senator, John McCain, took to Facebook to denounce the order, joining with Senator Lindsey Graham, writing:Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism. At this very moment, American troops are fighting side-by-side with our Iraqi partners to defeat ISIL. But this executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies. Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.When you ve lost John McCain, you know there s a problem. Although the sentiments expressed by the Senate Republicans are accurate and reflect what should be shared by 100% of their caucus, their words come a little too late. It became apparent that Trump s chief adviser, Steve Bannon, had his grubby, racist little hands all over it. Rudy Giuliani admitted on Fox News that Donald Trump knows this is a Muslim ban   he wanted one in the most  legal  way possible. Yet he continues to insist it is not a Muslim ban.What the Republicans also fail to note (or admit) is that the ban is just flat out racist.It s a good start, nut statements won t do a thing. It s time for them to come together with the Democrats to pass meaningful legislation and send a real message to the Trump White House.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,29-Jan-17
 Incompetent Trump WH Already F**king Up; Has To Adjust Their Muslim Ban (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is easily the most unprepared and incompetent person to ever be elected president. His most recent outrage of course is his immigration ban on those arriving in the United States from seven Muslim majority countries. That caused the nation and world to erupt in chaos, and people who were legal residents of the United States were turned away or deported   all because of their nations of origin. Now, realizing that they royally fucked up, Trump and his band of clowns are trying to hurriedly clean it up amid worldwide protests.On Sunday s edition of Meet the Press, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus decided that people who hold green cards and are perfectly safe and legal residents should be allowed to come home. He said to host Chuck Todd: If you re an American citizen travelling back and forth to Libya, you are likely to be subjected to further questioning when you come into an airport. There is discretionary authority that a custos and border patrol agent has when they suspect that someone is up to no good when they travel back and forth to Libya or Yemen. Make no mistake   this is the Muslim ban that Trump promised. The chaotic and dangerous happenings of Friday and Saturday are only the beginning. We could very well be headed for a repeat of what happened during the Holocaust, when The United States turned away boatloads of people who were fleeing Adolf Hitler s Nazi death camps. Most of those people went on to be brutally tortured and murdered   all because we were too protectionist and cold-hearted to help them flee for their lives.What Priebus said is nothing more than a smoke screen to make people think that what they are doing is for the good of the nation and its people. Make no mistake   it isn t. This is administration is nothing more than a coup, the first step in ushering in White Supremacy as an American value and matter of policy. The only saving grace is their gross incompetence, and their inability to hide what they are really doing from the public. In the meantime, we are all in terrible danger as a result of electing a completely unqualified madman as president. #RESIST.Featured image via G. Morty Ortega/Stringer/Getty Images",News,29-Jan-17
 Trump’s Ban Just Sentenced Two Christian Syrian Refugee Families To Persecution And Possible Death,"Donald Trump claimed that his ban would make America safe while favoring Christian refugees. He lied.On Sunday, Trump defended an executive order banning refugees from seven nations from entering the United States by claiming that it won t affect Christians.Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017Well, two Christian families are about to experience that horror despite almost stepping safely on American soil.According to NBC10, two Syrian families whose flight landed in Philadelphia were denied entry into the country and placed on a plane back to Syria despite being Christians and having family waiting for them at the airport.Two brothers and their wives and children fled Syria due to the war, persecution, and suffering taking place in the Middle Eastern nation. They have been working to come live in America for quite some time and it took months to go through the process of obtaining visas to get the opportunity to come here. Their travel plans had been set months in advance and they were looking forward to living in peace and making better lives for themselves in our land of opportunity.Pennsylvania resident and family member Joseph Assali called the situation a  nightmare. This is like a nightmare come true,  Assali said.  They re all Christian citizens and the executive order was supposed to protect Christians fleeing persecution. But it turns out Trump s order doesn t just affect Muslims, but anyone who seeks refuge from the seven countries on the list, even Christians Trump promised would not be turned away. They came as legal immigrants and were going to try sorting things out while they re here,  Assali continued, going on to state that his family members intended to become American citizens.But now they are on their way back to Syria, where they face persecution and possible death because of Donald Trump s bigotry and hatred.Here s the video via NBC10.Trump s order has caused and heartache around the world as families live in fear wondering if they will ever see their loved ones again. People are being detained at airports across the country or blocked from getting on planes just because they happen to be Muslim or from one of the countries on the list. People who have green cards are being affected and now even Christians are being punished by the order.But regardless of religion, any refugee should be granted asylum in this country. We are supposed to be a humanitarian nation, but by signing this ban, Trump turned against our values and gave terrorist organizations propaganda to use for recruitment. Trump is destroying the lives of millions of innocent people with this executive order and he needs to be stopped before he destroys our nation and everything we hold dear.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,29-Jan-17
 Trump Pathetically Tries To Defend His Muslim Ban On Twitter And People Are GUTTING Him For It,"Donald Trump took to Twitter to defend his Muslim ban on Sunday morning and got his ass handed to him by pissed off Americans.On Friday, Trump signed an unconstitutional executive order banning people from seven countries from entering the United States just because they happen to be Muslims.Trump claims that the order is necessary to keep Americans safe, but none of the countries listed are responsible for terrorist attacks against American citizens. In fact, all of the mass shootings in cities like Orlando, Ft. Hood, and San Bernardino were carried out by natural born American citizens. Furthermore, Trump left Saudi Arabia off the list even though the 9/11 hijackers originated from and were funded by the Saudis.In short, Trump s order does not keep America safe and has only caused chaos around the world while violating the rights of Americans.But Trump dared to defend his ban anyway.Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world   a horrible mess!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017Except that our country already has strong borders and immigrants already go through extreme vetting to get here. Refugees have to wait up to two years while they are strenuously investigated by several government agencies. Terrorism won t stop because of a wall or more vetting. But it will increase because Trump s ban will be used as propaganda by terrorist organizations to justify more attacks against America.And the reality is that Trump s order has made the world a bigger mess because people and businesses are scrambling to deal with the complications and families are experiencing fear that they ll never see their loved ones again due to the ban. Airports across the country are also a mess because people are being detained and blocked from entering the country, even those who have green cards and are permanent residents.The American people are already sick and tired of Trump and they absolutely put a boot up his ass on Twitter.@realDonaldTrump The people your order blocks from entering the US have lived here legally, sometimes for decades.

 WATCH: Father Of Slain Muslim-American Soldier Just Ripped Trump A New One Over Muslim Ban,"Donald Trump just got his ass handed to him by a Gold Star father for signing the despicable Muslim ban.Kahzir Khan is the father of Captain Humayun Khan, an American soldier who sacrificed his life in Iraq in 2004 for his fellow soldiers when he was killed by a car bomb that was intended to kill hundreds of American troops at the guard post he was inspecting.Captain Khan is buried at Arlington National Cemetery with the star and crescent adorning his gravestone. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart for his heroism and has become a shining example of why Donald Trump s attacks against Muslims are bullshit.During an appearance on MSNBC with Joy Reid, Kahzir Khan had strong words in response to Donald Trump s Muslim ban, which has caused worldwide chaos as travelers from seven nations have been detained or prevented from entering the country. Even green card holders are being detained.The executive order is a direct violation of the Constitution because it targets people based on religious beliefs, which is why Khan once again talked about his son. I am so saddened for my country, for my nation, for the country and nation for which we have fought and that we continue to defend,  Khan told Reid.  I invite Donald Trump and his racist and his Islamophobe coterie to go to the Arlington Cemetery and go to section 60, face all the tombstones there and if they have any shame, any shame at all, they should refrain from this un-American activity, un-American banning of Muslims, patriotic Muslims coming to the United states. And he didn t stop there. Khan continued slamming Trump and Republicans for abandoning the Constitution and humanitarianism. We are equal citizens and we will remain equal citizens. We defend the values of this country. We defend the Constitution of this country and we will remain standing also on our side, the majority of this country on our side. Donald Trump never got the majority votes of this country, we have the majority vote of this country. This is the time for Republicans to stand up for their values, otherwise like Donald Trump they will be part of this dark chapter that he s trying to write, that he has surrounded himself with unpatriotic Americans. Khan even took Trump minions Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon to the woodshed. They are operating my country, they are running this government by anecdotes, by alternative facts. What is that? This is how they are going to be dealing with the dignity of this country, the dignity of this nation? This country, this nation still remains a beacon of hope and we will stand in their way now and forever to not let them violate the basic foundations, the basic values of this country. The majority of this country is on our side and these protests are a reflection of that. They should get used to it and they should begin to understand what true America is, the true values of this country. We remain standing and we shall prevail. This is an ugly chapter, this is an ugly beginning but we will fix it. Here s the video via VidMe.Thousands of Muslims serve our country and risk their lives for our freedom every day. But this ban only serves as propaganda for ISIS and other terrorist organizations to use as a recruitment tool.Terrorists can point to this ban and say that America hates Muslims and we will pay the price for it. And so will our troops. Donald Trump is not making America safe. He giving terrorists a reason to kill more Americans like Captain Khan.Featured image via screenshot",News,29-Jan-17
 WATCH: Kellyanne Conway Says Worldwide Chaos Is A ‘Small Price To Pay’ For Banning Muslims,"Donald Trump stooge Kellyanne Conway attempted to defend the unconstitutional Muslim ban on Sunday and failed miserably.On Friday, Trump signed an executive order banning immigrants from Yemen, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Somalia, and Libya from entering the United States.The order instantly caused mass chaos as businesses rushed to call back employees from overseas and airports became detention centers. Even people with green cards, which makes them American citizens, are being barred from entering the country.During an interview with Fox News host Chris Wallace, Conway ignored the worldwide chaos and actually had the gall to call it a good thing that somehow makes America safer. You re talking about 325,000 people from overseas came into this country just yesterday through our airports,  Conway said when Wallace asked if Trump made a mistake by not thinking about the consequences of the order. You re talking about three hundred and some who have been detained or are prevented from gaining access to an aircraft in their home countries and must stay for now. That s 1 percent. And I think in terms of the upside being greater protection of our borders, of our people, it s a small price to pay. Here s the video via YouTube:Except that Trump s Muslim ban does not make America safer at all. In fact, it makes us less safe because extremists will use the ban as proof that America hates Muslims, which will be the perfect recruitment tool for terrorist organizations.For instance, this is how Iran responded to the order. While respecting the American people and distinguishing between them and the hostile policies of the U.S. government, Iran will implement the principle of reciprocity until the offensive U.S. limitations against Iranian nationals are lifted. The restrictions against travel by Muslims to America  are an open affront against the Muslim world and the Iranian nation in particular and will be known as a great gift to extremists. So we can expect terrorist organizations like ISIS to use Trump s ban as a recruiting tool to persuade more people to align with them and commit acts of terrorism against the United States and nothing Trump does will stop them because his administration is far too incompetent to do so.The ban also would not have prevented any of the mass shootings conservatives point to as justification for the ban such as shootings in Ft. Hood, Orlando, and San Bernardino, because all of the shooters were natural born United States citizens.And Trump s ban did not include nations that are actually responsible for killing American citizens, such as Saudi Arabia, where the 9/11 hijackers were from and received funding.This Muslim ban is totally unconstitutional and targets people because of their religion. It goes against our values as a nation and every American should be horrified by what Trump has done. Our reputation around the world has just been sullied and we are going to pay a price in blood for it.Featured image via screenshot",News,29-Jan-17
 British PM Had To Hold Trump’s Hand Like A F*cking Child Because Of His Fear Of ‘Stairs And Slopes’,"Try not to laugh too hard at this one.Apparently, conservative hero   our brave President   can face down Muslim terrorists, Mexican rapists, reality, and all other imagined enemies concocted by the American Right   but he completely crumbles into a blubbering mess when confronted with his greatest enemies: slight inclines and staircases.According to British publication The Sun, Trump was seen holding hands with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May for a very interesting reason: he suffers from a disorder called bathmophobia, a severe fear of stairs and slopes so pervasive that he can be triggered just by looking at them.While the handholding that was observed has been presented as a sign of how deeply they have bonded, The Sun published a report on Saturday that shoots down that idea completely:Government sources in Washington DC said they had been told the New York property billionaire is uncomfortable with using either [stairs or slopes].The 70-year-old president is thought to have grabbed Theresa May s hand to steady himself as the pair walked down a ramp in a colonnade, before then rubbing it in thanks.Trump s phobia also means he refuses to visit one close aide s office in the White House because it s up a flight of stairs from the Oval Office.Downing Street last night would not discuss the president s alleged phobia, instead dubbing the hand holding  a chivalrous gesture .Trump also recently confessed to being a germaphobe (to the point that he says he is  going to do everything in my power not to shake hands with teachers  because  they have 17,000 germs per square inch on their desk ) as he attempted to shut down reports that he had paid a couple nice Russian ladies to pee on a bed in a hotel room because President Obama had once slept there.Does this new information matter at a time that the world is fighting his recent attempt to ban Muslims from entering the country? Absolutely not. But this weekend, we all needed a laugh.Featured image via Getty Images (Christopher Furlong)",News,29-Jan-17
 Dulles Airport ERUPTS As Detained Family Reunites After Trump’s Muslim Ban (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s Muslim ban was one of the main focal points in his presidential campaign, but no one imagined that he d actually follow through with it so quickly after officially becoming President.Trump s first week in office was marked by several inhumane executive orders, one of which involved banning refugees from seven predominately Muslim countries. As a result, on Saturday travelers to the U.S. were humiliated and detained for up to 12 hours at airports across the country, receiving word that they could not come into America as their relatives waited anxiously to hear what would happen. It is a disgusting ordeal to put a family through, and signifies the breakdown of the U.S. Constitution under Trump s administration.Fortunately, people like Trump are not the majority. In response to this disgusting ban, thousands of protesters gathered at airports around the country to fight for the rights of the citizens being detained. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and volunteer lawyers got to work, offering their services pro bono to aide the detainees, and last night America finally saw its first win against Trump s tyranny.Brooklyn Federal Judge Ann Donnelly slapped the law down on Trump and was able to enact a nationwide temporary emergency block to Trump s Muslim ban, relieving these families and citizens from their anguish. ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero responded to the ruling: Clearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country. Our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court. If you want to see just how monumental this was, you don t have to look any further than the outpouring of emotion that happened at Dulles Airport in North Virginia, after the Federal Judge granted travelers stay. In a crowd of over 1,000 people, a family reunited for the first time after authorities detained a woman due to Trump s Muslim ban. You can watch the powerful moment below:Amazing, emotional scenes here at Dulles as some passengers finally unite with crying relatives surrounded by protestors welcoming them. pic.twitter.com/h8sW3LR75N  (((YousefMunayyer))) (@YousefMunayyer) January 29, 2017We must never forget that what Trump is doing is not only cruel and ruining people s lives, but it is unconstitutional. While this is only a temporary win, it shows that when Americans unite, we are capable of fighting even the greatest of evils. We need to keep going.Featured image via Scott Eisen / Getty Images",News,29-Jan-17
 Alec Baldwin Just Tore Trump Apart Limb By Stupid Limb After Hellish Weekend Of Tyranny (TWEETS),"After this past week and few days that Trump has been our President*, we as Americans have no choice but to be fully aware of the horrors that are in store for us. Already, he has signed executive orders authorizing a partial Muslim ban that led to nationwide protests before it was ultimately shut down (temporarily) by a federal judge, removing funding from any international health organizations that so much as mention abortion, two major pipelines that will destroy our environment, his stupid fucking wall, and even concentration camps for the millions of undocumented immigrants he intends to round up.Already, the first President in history that was effectively installed by a hostile foreign dictator through an aggressive propaganda and fake news campaign as well as a series of hacks directly authorized and overseen by Russian President Vladimir Putin, is not only proving the naysayers correct, but showing the world that they have underestimated the level of horribleness he can attain. As always, Alec Baldwin rushed to the rescue Saturday night with exactly the words we need to hear:1- This country had a calling card.We all knew what it was.It wasn't Wall Street or Hollywood or the right to bear arms that brought  ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 29, 20172- that brought countless people, America's future, to this country. It was freedom.Freedom was our calling card.Trump wants to kill that  ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 29, 2017 This country had a calling card. We all knew what it was. It wasn t Wall Street or Hollywood or the right to bear arms that brought America s future, to this country. It was freedom,  Baldwin wrote.  Freedom was our calling card. Trump wants to kill that. Baldwin came to the conclusion reached by many, including a growing number of those who voted for him:  Trump s gota go. 3- Trump's gotta go.  ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 29, 2017 All the indignation is fine. But we gotta get him out! We must demand a competency test!  Baldwin later added.  He is ill! Mentally ill! All the indignation is fine.But we gotta get him out!We must demand a competency test!He is ill!Mentally ill!  ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 29, 2017He s exactly right. Unfortunately most options are going to prove to be fruitless. Impeachment would require the rather enthusiastic participation of a Republican-controlled Congress. The 25th Amendment allows the Vice President and cabinet to declare him unfit for pretty much any reason, but that requires the people Trump appointed to turn on him and things are actually going pretty well for them right now as The Donald checks off the Neo-Nazi wish list items one by one. It would also require Republicans in general to be halfway decent people who care about the good of their country.Right now, things seem hopeless but something amazing is happening. Trump is bringing Americans together, causing even those who once were silent in the face of right-wing oppression to rise up and declare that they are not willing to take it anymore. Americans as a whole are facing this adversity head-on and, most importantly, together.Right now, our future is uncertain, but our number one duty to our country is to oppose Trump s hateful agenda at every turn. Our elected leaders   the ones with backbones, anyway   absolutely must obstruct Trump in any way possible. Our nation has never faced a test like Donald Trump, and it is imperative that we do not fail.Featured image via screengrab",News,29-Jan-17
 DHS Officials Tried To Stop Trump’s Unlawful Muslim Ban — Steve Bannon Overruled Them,"Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday which enacted the Muslim ban he has been promising for months. A federal judge temporarily blocked the order on Saturday. But now, it appears that Trump s advisor Steve Bannon, who just happens to be a white supremacist, overruled the Department of Homeland Security to pass the bigoted ban in the first place.Like most of Trump s actions, he didn t really bother to consult anybody except for his inner circle about this executive order. He says that he only surrounds himself with the best people but none of them actually have a clue WTF they are doing when it comes to the law. When Trump signed the order nobody even knew what countries were affected by the ban.According to CNN,  the policy team at the White House developed the executive order on refugees and visas, and largely avoided the traditional interagency process that would have allowed the Justice Department and homeland security agencies to provide operational guidance. It wasn t until after Trump had signed his name on the dotted line that DHS really got a chance to sit down and try to determine if the order was even legal. A person with knowledge of the matter said that homeland security staff didn t even get to lay eyes on the order until Friday. Even Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Department of Homeland Security leadership didn t get to see the document until just before Trump signed it into law. The administration also chose not to allow the Office of Legal Counsel to provide legal guidance on the matter.After they were finally allowed to review the order, DHS reportedly decided that the ban could not apply to green card holders, who are legal residents of the U.S., but Trump s Bannon overruled them. CNN reports:It was finally decided that decisions on whether or not to allow green card holders to enter the U.S. would be made on a case by case basis, but directives issued to airlines clearly state that lawful permanent residents are not included and may continue to travel to the USA.  This would include green card holders as they are  lawful permanent residents  of the United States.A source close to the administration said that Bannon had been heading up the directives regarding green cards. No doubt Bannon, with his racist  alt-right  ideologies, is running point on this whole mission. This is what happens when you let a white supremacist run the country.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,29-Jan-17
 REPORT: Five-Year-Old Girl Is Detained And Separated From Mother At Airport Because Of Trump’s Muslim Ban,"Attorneys are racing to the defense of a child after the little girl was detained by airport security because of the Muslim ban signed by Donald Trump.On Saturday, Trump told the press that his executive order banning Muslims from entering the United was  working out very nicely  amid the mass chaos that has ensued ever since he issued the order. It s not a Muslim ban, but we re totally prepared,  Trump claimed.  It s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over. It s working out very nicely and we re gonna have a very, very strict ban and we re going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years. Except that it s NOT  working very nicely  at all.Thousands of people are finding themselves stranded or detained at airports because of the order. Even holders of green cards are being prevented from entering the United States despite being citizens of this nation. Protests against Trump s order have also been popping up at airports across the country.And things got even worse on Saturday evening when security at Dulles International Airport detained a five-year-old girl and refused to let her mother see her.Seriously, how in the hell is a five-year-old girl even considered a terror threat in this country?Former Governor Howard Dean posted the news on Twitter and pleaded for an attorney to go to the scene to rescue the girl as soon as possible.This is now a violation of a federal court order. A lawyer is needed at Dulles. https://t.co/g2lUc3EYuP  Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) January 29, 2017Indeed, a federal judge issued an emergency stay against Trump s executive order earlier on Saturday which prevents the government from sending people out of the country if they have visas allowing them entry.So a scared little girl is literally being detained and kept from her mother because Donald Trump is an asshole. He needs to be sued into oblivion for this, or better yet, chased out of this country and banned from ever returning. Because his policies are turning America into a disaster.Featured image via Pixabay",News,28-Jan-17
 WATCH: Trump Supporter Gets His A** Handed To Him By CNN On The Air For Lying About Muslim Ban,"CNN host Poppy Harlow absolutely humiliated a Republican supporter of Donald Trump for lying about the Muslim ban that Trump ordered on Friday.The immigration ban is currently causing chaos in the United States and around the world, and has been condemned by leaders across the globe, but Trump and his supporters insist that the executive order is working and keeping Americans safe from terrorism.During an appearance on CNN to defend the ban, former GOP Rep. Jack Kingston repeatedly made claims that Harlow fact-checked on the air, and it didn t go well for the congressman. What data can you point to that justifies that these seven nations have a tie to U.S. terror attacks or a higher incidence of bringing terror to this country?  Harlow asked.Kingston, of course, blamed the nations, including Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Yemen, Sudan, and Somalia, for forcing Trump s hand because they supposedly don t love America, which is somehow part of the criteria now for who we have dealings with. I think maybe the idea that I would say, the evidence is that the countries themselves don t really have a standard that would preclude enemies of the United States from emigrating here. These are not countries that are known to love the United States of America. But that doesn t explain why countries like Russia, which launched cyberattacks against the United States during the 2016 election, is not on the list. And Harlow made sure she asked. So you say these are not countries that love the United States and therefore this is justified. So, what about Russia? Kingston tried to spin that by claiming that Sudan is a bigger threat to America than Russia. Well, I think in Russia   you know, there s a lot of other Islamic countries and other countries that aren t always fond of America, but I don t think you have necessarily the concerns and the vigilance that you need if you re talking about Sudan. After Harlow explained that emigrating into this country is a difficult and complicated process, she dropped the hammer on Kingston with a single question. Congressman, can you point to a single terrorist attack in this country that was carried out by a Syrian refugee? I think you could look at DHS records and see that refugees in general have often been the cloak under which terrorists do move from country to country,  Kingston replied.  And we do not know who s coming in to our country. Harlow countered Kingston s bullshit by asking the question again. But Congressman, I asked if you could point to an event that you feel justifies this ban, that has endangered or killed American people. This time, Kingston replied by naming places where mass shootings have taken place, including Ft. Hood, Orlando, and San Bernardino, as well as terrorist attacks in Europe and other parts of the world.Harlow called out Kingston for making  unfactual  claims, and proceeded to inform Kingston that all the shooters who committed massacres in those American cities were all American citizens who were born here. And none of them, including those who committed terrorist attacks in Europe, were Syrian refugees.Here s the video via YouTube.In fact, no citizens from any of the countries listed in Trump s ban have ever murdered an American on our own soil. However, there are nations Trump left off the list that are at least partly responsible for the murders of thousands of Americans, including Saudi Arabia, which helped fund the 9/11 attacks and was the nation from which most of the attackers came.@TomKingTK pic.twitter.com/eT65nfOb5s  Rafael Esteban (@RafaelEsteban__) January 28, 2017The bottom line is that Trump and his supporters are lying about the Muslim ban, and as long as the media does what Poppy Harlow did, they ll nail them for it in real time instead of letting them get away with lying on the air only to call them out later. Because at this time, catching them later is too late.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video ",News,28-Jan-17
 A Federal Judge Just Told Trump To Take His Muslim Ban And Shove It,"A federal judge in Brooklyn, ruling on behalf of the ACLU and two Iraqis detained at New York s JFK International Airport, has placed a stay on Trump s Muslim ban. The move comes amidst massive protests all over the country, lawyers making sure that those denied entry despite having the necessary paperwork have representation, and more.Two Iraqis were held at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City today, and although they ve been released, many others, including green card holders, people on student visas, people on work visas, and even people on visitor visas, have found themselves unable to enter the U.S. In some cases they re held at their port of entry (such as the international terminal at an airport), and in others, they re actually pulled off of planes before they even leave their countries of origin.Congress enacted a law in 1965 that prohibits us from discriminating against anyone when it comes to immigrant visas on the basis of their race, gender, nationality, place of residency or place of birth. This ban is supposed to make it harder for terrorists to come in, but is probably illegal despite being signed by Cheetolini here.It s also likely having the opposite effect of what Trumplestiltskin thinks it will. As one former CIA agent said on Twitter:I proudly served in the CIA post 9/11. Fought actual terrorists. The ban makes that fight harder. It makes us less safe. pic.twitter.com/THN70v4bOC  Tom King (@TomKingTK) January 28, 2017That goes against everyone who keeps insisting that it s for the nation s own good that we do this. The fact of the matter is, though, that the former CIA agent is right. When we alienate predominantly Muslim countries, we make radicalization far easier. We also make countries want to retaliate, as Iran has done already.Congressional Democrats have gone on record condemning Trump and his Muslim ban:RM @RepEliotEngel s statement on executive action on refugees: https://t.co/hNvbdz8awm pic.twitter.com/KNDBAchjYB  Foreign Affairs Cmte (@HFACDemocrats) January 27, 2017These Exec Orders will only serve to embolden & inspire those around the globe who would do us harm.

Dent seems to be the only one with any compassion right now.The stay is temporary, and it will be up to the courts whether to make it permanent or not. Basically, though, what this judge did was halt an illegal and unconstitutional executive order, effectively telling Trump to take his Muslim ban and shove it.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images",News,28-Jan-17
" Wikipedia BRUTALLY Trashes Paul Ryan, Adds Him To Spineless Animals Page (IMAGES)","Donald Trump s latest executive orders are being protested against and shredded for their xenophobic, hateful nature   and the Republicans who didn t have the backbone to stand up to him are getting equally pummeled.Among the biggest moronic minion who didn t have the balls to stand up to tyrant Trump is House Speaker Paul Ryan, who got absolutely decimated on Wikipedia recently. In reference to his complete lack of spine, a Wikipedia page listed him under invertebrates, joining the ranks of creatures like worms. Truly, there has never been a better way to describe Ryan and similar GOPers   until now.This edit to the invertebrate Wikipedia page was first spotted by BuzzFeed s Alp Ozcelik, and it is SO perfect:According to the Wikipedia page, invertebrates are characterized like this: The trait that is common to all invertebrates is the absence of a vertebral column (backbone): this creates a distinction between invertebrates and vertebrates. The distinction is one of convenience only; it is not based on any clear biologically homologous trait, any more than the common trait of having wings functionally unites insects, bats, and birds, or than not having wings unites tortoises, snails and sponges. Being animals, invertebrates are heterotrophs, and require sustenance in the form of the consumption of other organisms. With a few exceptions, such as the Porifera, invertebrates generally have bodies composed of differentiated tissues. There is also typically a digestive chamber with one or two openings to the exterior. We couldn t have said it better ourselves. Ryan s behavior when it comes to Trump has been extremely disappointing, and he has become more of a pushover since Trump officially became POTUS. Proving that he doesn t have the guts or spine to stand by his previous statements, Ryan quietly allowed Trump to go ahead with his Muslim ban this week, despite the fact that he felt VERY differently in July:To compare, this is what Ryan said after Trump signed his disastrous executive order this week: Our number one responsibility is to protect the homeland. We are a compassionate nation, and I support the refugee resettlement program, but it s time to reevaluate and strengthen the visa vetting process. This is why we passed bipartisan legislation in the wake of the Paris attacks to pause the intake of refugees. President Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country. It is absolutely disgusting to have people like this in power. Fortunately, the internet came to our rescue to provide some much needed humor during a time when doom seems eminent. At least someone still dares to tell the truth   even if they re just anonymously editing a Wikipedia page. We truly hope they will do it again!Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",News,28-Jan-17
 Trump BETRAYED: GOP Rep. DEFENDS Refugees Against His Muslim Ban,"Republican Congressman Charlie Dent represents a district with one of the largest Syrian refugee populations in the country, and he is not happy about Trump s Muslim ban. He spoke to The New York Times  Jonathan Martin, saying: I urge the administration to halt enforcement of this order until a more thoughtful and deliberate policy can be instated. One of Dent s constituents is a family that was detained in Philadelphia, despite having all the necessary paperwork, including green cards, to enter the country. This has been the story all over the U.S.   people held, or even turned around, despite having all of the necessary legal paperwork to enter the U.S.And there are protests erupting all over the place because of this. People are demanding U.S. Customs release those they ve detained, even though Customs officials have to follow Trump s edicts.But Dent seems to be primarily alone in his party. Republicans on Capitol Hill seem to be keeping their mouths shut on the issue, probably because they thought it was a good idea and now can t admit they might have been wrong about what would happen. Or they re still delusional. The New York Times  Glenn Thrush said they haven t been this quiet  since the last positive jobs report under Obama. The few that have spoken about it say it s necessary to prevent terrorists from entering the U.S., but what they re totally missing is that this is just going to provide more fodder for radical elements like ISIS to recruit new members. It also splits families up, prevents people from coming home even if they live here perfectly legally, has already sparked backlash from Iran, and is an overall mess.One immigration expert calls this illegal because of a 1965 law that prohibits discriminating against people based on their race, sex, nationality, place of residence, or place of birth. So where are Republicans?Except for Dent, they seem to be hiding.Featured image by Pete Marovich via Getty Images",News,28-Jan-17

 Malala Yousafzai’s Message To Trump Is Something EVERYONE Needs To Listen To,"With Donald Trump writing Executive Orders that ban Muslims from several countries, including refugees from war torn countries, it s left many wondering if Trump even has a soul.There are literally families dying, children dying, communities ravaged, and Trump has the audacity to turn his cold shoulder to all of them. It s not only cruel, it s brutally un-American and stands against everything we ve ever been as a nation.The Statue of Liberty still stands, and the message of refuge cannot be lost.With one of the most honest and poignant messages yet, Malala Yousafzai wrote a statement regarding Trump and his orders. Everyone needs to listen to it and take it to heart, most especially Donald Trump.Here is Malala s statement regarding Trump s executive orders: I am heartbroken that today President Trump is closing the door on children, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war. I am heartbroken that America is turning its back on a proud history of welcoming refugees and immigrants   the people who helped build your country, ready to work hard in exchange for a fair chance at a new life.I am heartbroken that Syrian refugee children, who have suffered through six years of war by no fault of their own, are singled-out for discrimination.I am heartbroken for girls like my friend Zaynab, who fled wars in three countries   Somalia, Yemen and Egypt   before she was even 17. Two years ago she received a visa to come to the United States. She learned English, graduated high school and is now in college studying to be a human rights lawyer.Zaynab was separated from her little sister when she fled unrest in Egypt. Today her hope of being reunited with her precious sister dims.In this time of uncertainty and unrest around the world, I ask President Trump not to turn his back on the world s most defenseless children and families.  Hopefully, he listens sooner rather than later. Featured Photo by Dan Kitwood   WPA Pool/Getty Images",News,28-Jan-17
 Ex-KGB Chief Who Leaked Incriminating Trump Info Found Dead In The Back Of A Car In Russia,"Trump and his allies expect us to dismiss the 35-page dossier that details Donald Trump and his team s ties to the Russian government, but a lot of crazy stuff keeps happening that makes it impossible.When it was just former MI6 agent and author of the report Christopher Steele, who is in hiding to protect himself from both Trump and Putin s goons, saying that President Asterisk s closet is overflowing with skeletons (and Russian hooker urine) it was one thing, but the existence of audio and even video of Trump engaging in incriminating acts was confirmed by at least four sources, including one in the American intelligence community. Israeli intelligence officials have also been warned about sharing intel with Trump s administration for fear that it will be leaked to Vladimir Putin. And then there s the little matter of what happened to a gentleman who helped Steele compile his incriminating yet not entirely verified report Oleg Erovinkin was a former general in the KGB and the FSB. He is suspected of feeding information to Steele, and he was found dead in his car on Boxing Day. Russian state-run media initially reported that foul play was involved when  Erovinkin s body was  found in a black Lexus  [and] a large-scale investigation has been commenced in the area. Erovinkin s body was sent to the FSB morgue.  Since then, the cause of death has been downgraded to  heart attack.  The Telegraph reports:Erovinkin was a key aide to Igor Sechin, a former deputy prime minister and now head of Rosneft, the state-owned oil company, who is repeatedly named in the dossier.Erovinkin has been described as a key liaison between Sechin and Russian president Vladimir Putin. Mr Steele writes in an intelligence report dated July 19, 2016, he has a source close to Sechin, who had disclosed alleged links between Mr Trump s supporters and Moscow.The death of Erovinkin has prompted speculation it is linked to Mr Steele s explosive dossier, which was made public earlier this month. Mr Trump has dismissed the dossier as  fake news  and no evidence has emerged to support its lurid claims.The Russian state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported Erovinkin s body was  found in a black Lexus  [and] a large-scale investigation has been commenced in the area. Erovinkin s body was sent to the FSB morgue .No cause of death has been confirmed and the FSB continues to investigate. Media reports suggested his death was a result of foul play.It was later claimed he died of a heart attack.  Christo Grozev, an expert on Russia-related security threats, believes Erovinkin is the key source to whom Mr Steele refers in his dossier. Insiders have described Erovinkin to me alternately as  Sechin s treasurer  and  the go-between between Putin and Sechin . One thing that everyone seems to agree    both in public and private sources   is that Erovinkin was Sechin s closest associate, Grozev says. I have no doubt that at the time Erovinkin died, Mr Putin had Mr Steele s Trump dossier on his desk. He would   arguably   have known whether the alleged  story is based on fact or fiction. Whichever is true, he would have had a motive to seek    and find the mole,  he adds.  He would have had to conclude that Erovinkin was at least a person of interest. At this point, it will be difficult for our own intelligence agencies to get to the bottom of this situation. Recently, for example, Trump decided to retain James Comey   yes, the guy who interfered in the election on his behalf   as the head of the FBI. The Donald also has the power to fire Comey if the ongoing investigation is not positive for Trump. At around the same time as the announcement, the Bureau cleared Michael Flynn of any wrongdoing in his numerous, suspicious calls to the Russian ambassador.Our country is in a bad place and we need more information to correctly determine what is going on with any of this   information the current administration and his despotic allies will go to any lengths to hide.Was Erovinkin murdered because of his knowledge of information that could greatly hurt Trump and his BFF Putin? Maybe, maybe not. Putin is exactly the sort of person who has been known to leave a trail of dead journalists in his wake for reporting too much. It s not outside the realm of possibility that he had a former KGB agent murdered for knowing too much.Featured image via Getty Images (Drew Angerer)/Twitter",News,28-Jan-17
 WATCH: Conservative Activist Openly Declares That Contraception Should Be Illegal,"MSNBC host Joy Reid was SHOCKED when a conservative anti-choice activist openly stated that birth control should be banned.During a panel discussion on Saturday, Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life literally admitted that she wants a law that forces women to get pregnant if they want to have sex.The discussion began with Reid pointing out that contraception and mammogram costs will go up for women if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.Reid asked the panel if they agreed that contraception should be legal, and Hawkins not only disagreed, she spewed misinformation about two popular forms of contraception. I believe certain forms can be legal, yes,  Hawkins said.  I don t believe abortion causing contraception should be legal. When asked to specifically name a form of contraception she thinks should be outlawed, Hawkins mentioned  hormonal contraception  like IUDs.REID:  You think IUDs should be illegal? HAWKINS:  I don t think they should be legal. They put women at risk and they kill children. Except that IUDs are one of the safest forms of birth control, and they work by preventing sperm from joining with the egg.According to the Baby Center,Both types of IUDs work primarily by preventing sperm from fertilizing an egg. The copper IUD releases copper into the uterus, which works as a spermicide. The others release a form of the hormone progestin into the uterus. The progestin thickens the cervical mucus so that sperm can t reach the egg.In other words, unless conservatives now believe that life begins BEFORE conception, they should have absolutely no problem with IUDs.But Hawkins also declared that birth control pills should be illegal as well.However, birth control pills also prevent conception by stopping sperm from reaching an egg.According to Columbia University,Birth control pills prevent pregnancy through several mechanisms, mainly by stopping ovulation. If no egg is released, there is nothing to be fertilized by sperm, and the woman cannot get pregnant.So once again, Hawkins is wrong. But she repeated her claims again after Reid asked her to clarify her remarks, and Hawkins confirmed once and for all that anti-choice conservatives want to ban birth control as well as abortion. In my ideal world, yes. But I don t think that s something we re working towards in the pro-life movement. In the pro-life movement we re working towards abolishing abortion. That s why we want Planned Parenthood s money to go to health centers which don t do contraception. By taking money away from Planned Parenthood, millions of women would have less access to birth control that would prevent unwanted pregnancies and abortions. We ve gotten some real clarity,  Reid commented at the end of the segment.  I think the American people have gotten quite a bit of clarity on what your movement wants to do. Here s the video via VidMe.And if conservatives like Hawkins get their way, Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress will strip women of their reproductive rights. And women won t be marching in Washington in defense of their rights next time. They ll declare war on Washington.Featured image via screen capture ",News,28-Jan-17
 Google CEO SHREDS Trump’s Immigration Ban For Being Bad For Business And Families,"Donald Trump s ban on Muslims emigrating to the United States is having a negative effect on businesses and the families of employees. And the CEO of Google just called him out for it.When it became clear that Trump was going to sign an executive order banning Muslims from entering the United States, companies across the country recalled employees who were working overseas back to the United States so they would not be locked out after the order went into effect.Trump s ban has struck fear into the hearts of families who have loved ones working for American companies in other nations.According to Bloomberg, Microsoft  inserted language in a securities filing on Thursday on the issue, cautioning investors that immigration restrictions  may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts.' Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg also expressed his concern about the policy.And now, Google CEO Sundar Pichai is criticizing Trump s immigration ban as well. In an email to employees obtained by Bloomberg, Pichai vowed to fight for his employees  rights and talked about how hurtful it is to witness how this policy is affecting families. We re upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US,  Pichai wrote.  It s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues. Pichai went on to explain that employees are  grappling with what this might mean for them and their families,  and described how an employee was in New Zealand and had to rush back to the United States to make sure they didn t become trapped overseas away from home.A company representative later added,  We ll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere. This executive order has already drawn condemnation from the business community and leaders around the world. Trump is turning America into a totalitarian country, and every human being in this country, and all over the globe, should be frightened by it. Trump s agenda is going to hurt businesses, our economy, and our reputation. And it s just going to get worse because Trump is nowhere near finished destroying this country and everything it stands for. This is just the beginning.Featured image via Wikimedia ",News,28-Jan-17
 Trump Just SLAMMED U.S. Shut To Far More Than Refugees – Worldwide Chaos Reigns,"It s chaos all across the nation s ports of entry today, and indeed, the world over, as Trump s Muslim ban goes into effect. The ban bars not just refugees from Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, Libya, Sudan, and Syria, but also legal permanent residents (green card holders). A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told Reuters simply: It will bar green card holders. That s ridiculous. That s just patently absurd. That s just vile, sick and disgusting. Trump is an asshole   there s literally no other way to put it.But that s not all who will be refused entry to the U.S. Work visa holders, student visa holders, and more also find themselves in limbo today. As The New York Times put it: President Trump s executive order on immigration quickly reverberated through the United States and across the globe on Saturday, slamming the border shut for an Iranian scientist headed to a lab in Boston, an Iraqi who had worked as an interpreter for the United States Army, and a Syrian refugee family headed to a new life in Ohio, among countless others. A lot of these people were in the air, on their way here, when Trump signed that order and now they can t get in, but they can t go home either because they re refugees, or they re people who need to be here for one reason or another.Two Iraqis being held at New York s John F. Kennedy International Airport have already filed a lawsuit over this. One supposedly has been released from detention, but there s no word yet if he s free to go on his way or is being put on a plane back to Iraq.The lawyers for these two say that detaining individuals with valid visas is illegal and it may well be. However, court papers say that authorities from U.S. Customs and Border Protection wouldn t allow lawyers to meet with these two. They were reportedly told to try and talk to Trump directly, and weren t even allowed to speak to U.S. Reps. Jerrold Nadler or Nydia Velasquez: When Mr. Darweesh s attorneys approached CBP requesting to speak with Mr. Darweesh, CBP indicated that they were not the ones to talk to about seeing their client. When the attorneys asked,  Who is the person to talk to?  the CBP agents responded,  Mr. President. Call Mr. Trump. In Istanbul, security officers reportedly boarded a U.S.-bound plane to remove an Iranian woman and her family. Iranian green card holders were dumbfounded as to the legal limbo they ve suddenly found themselves in. They don t know how they re going to get to the country they now call home.Visas for students and visitors have been suspended indefinitely. Refugees are being held where they are, or turned away at U.S. ports of entry. Businesses who were counting on unusually talented people from these countries are angry. Green card holders who actually live here are stuck, or being turned away.This is Trump s America. Our unofficial slogan,  the land of the free,  is dead.Featured image by Olivier Douliery via Getty Images",News,28-Jan-17
 WATCH: Bill Nye Predicts ‘Big Trouble’ After Trump Silences Government Scientists,"Donald Trump s war on science drew a response from  The Science Guy  on Saturday morning.Trump and his team of minions are trying to stop scientists from doing research and sharing the results with the public.From the Environmental Protection Agency to the Department of Energy, Trump is systematically dismantling critical research and testing that helps citizens and businesses make decisions and keeps us safe.Trump is halting water and air quality tests along with climate change research, all of which could mean the difference between life and death for millions of Americans as Trump moves to approve oil drilling and pipelines and doubles down on coal instead of clean energy sources that will cut pollution and slow the effects of climate change.Rather than accept real facts, Trump and his team are touting what they call  alternative facts.  Trump and conservatives are living in a delusional world where facts don t matter because they directly contradict their own worldview.During a discussion with Joy Reid, Nye explained why Trump s rejection of facts is going to take years to reverse and that it will spell  big trouble  for our nation and the world. Well, any time you re burning fossil fuels, you authorize more pipelines, you re headed for trouble in the big picture. But in the bigger picture is this thing, you know, this word we love,  cognitive dissonance,  this phrase. You have a worldview that disagrees with what you observe. So you might expect, if you were as open-minded as a scientist, as a scientifically-literate voter or taxpayer, you might expect that data would change your mind   but that s not how people are.People on either side, the other side and this side, you double down when you find conflict, it s called the  Backfire Effect,  it backfires, and you get more entrenched in your worldview. For example, if somebody believes in astrology, it takes them about two years to get over it. You have to show them over and over there s no such thing as astrology, it doesn t really work, and then they let go. But everybody s expectation that you ll let go in a week is not going to be met.So our problem, everybody, is this doubling down, this backfire effect. So we have to work, I think, diligently in the science community to fight back. Of course there are the facts, we start with those. But there s this human nature thing on both sides to fight back. We have our bubble over here, they have their bubble over there. Here s the video via VidMe:Shutting down our scientists puts Americans in danger. We can no longer keep our environment safe if they can not do their jobs and tell us the information we need to know. Increased mining and drilling will end up poisoning our lands and water supply and increase the effects of climate change. Trump s denial of basic facts is going to get Americans killed and that blood will be on his hands and he should be held accountable for it.Featured image via screenshot",News,28-Jan-17
 WATCH: Bill Maher’s Hilarious Opening Monologue Will Make Trump Explode With Rage,"Bill Maher is definitely not afraid of Donald Trump.Ever since Trump was sworn-in on inauguration day he has been openly whining about media reports on the size of his inauguration crowd, insisting that his crowd was the largest in history despite photographic evidence that shows otherwise.Trump s inauguration was absolutely pathetic and his obsession with the crowd size only demonstrates that he is way too thin-skinned to be president.As you may recall, Trump took a moment during a visit to CIA Headquarters to claim that his crowd filled the National Mall and numbered at least  1.5 million.  He also threatened the media for reporting the real numbers.For the record, here s a side by side of President Obama s inauguration, which drew a record 1.8 million people compared to Trump s in 2017. Both images were taken just as the swearing-in ceremony began.For those saying  Trump can t be that hated, look at the size of the crowd    #Inauguration pic.twitter.com/Sczp6Feta5  Stefan Kay (@5tefanK) January 20, 2017Trump even literally sent his official White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer to complain about media coverage of the inauguration in a press briefing. And Trump is still complaining a week later.Well, Bill Maher returned just in time to mock Trump s inauguration last Friday but only got the chance to address Trump s bitching on this week s edition of Real Time.During the opening monologue, Maher absolutely NAILED the real reason why Trump is so upset about the small crowd size he drew on inauguration day. He can t stand it that when it comes to the size of the crowd, Obama s was bigger. This is about c*ck, right? This is about d*ck! This is about a guy who never brought a woman to orgasm! He probably thinks it s rigged. The rest of the monologue was funny, too, but Trump is going to explode after he hears that one joke.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is a petty loser who can t handle any amount of criticism. If Trump reacts to Maher s monologue it is sure to be an epic temper tantrum the likes of which we haven t seen.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,28-Jan-17
 Trump Begins Day Of Diplomacy By Escalating Hot War With The Press (TWEETS),"Donald Trump is supposed to have several important phone calls with world leaders today, amounting to what is being billed as a  day of diplomacy.  Given Trump s inexperience and impulsive statements, world leaders are especially skeptical of what his being leader of the free world (*SHUDDER*) will really mean for the world. So, one would think that he would spend his morning preparing for his calls, right? WRONG.Instead, Trump is up and tweeting, when he is, as of this writing, set to be on a call with the Prime Minister of Japan at any moment. His target? Why, the press, of course. The Washington Post and the New York Times have been on Trump s hit list for quite some time, and that thorny relationship has gotten worse, since Trump s White House is leaking like a sieve regarding his temperament and inability to do his job as president. It was the Washington Post who said Trump s team is portraying him as a  clueless child,  which of course enraged the thin-skinned sorry excuse for a  president.  To that end, Trump fired off a series of tweets doing his best to discredit those outlets:The failing @nytimes has been wrong about me from the very beginning. Said I would lose the primaries, then the general election. FAKE NEWS!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2017Thr coverage about me in the @nytimes and the @washingtonpost gas been so false and angry that the times actually apologized to its ..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2017 dwindling subscribers and readers.They got me wrong right from the beginning and still have not changed course, and never will. DISHONEST  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2017So, in other words, Trump is proving the aides who are leaking the details of his alarming behavior to the press right. He is clueless, dangerously impulsive, petty, and acting like a child. In fact, they are likely leaking this information to the public in a desperate attempt to make Trump behave like a world leader rather than like the man baby that he is, since he gets all of his information from the cable news shows.Whatever the reason, keep the leaks coming, folks. The American public   and, indeed, the press   need to keep the pressure on Trump and let the nation and world know just what a dangerous fool is currently occupying the Oval Office.#RESIST.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,28-Jan-17
" ‘Calexit’ Is Really A Thing, Might Mean Actual Secession (DETAILS)","California has had a movement going for the last couple of  years that is pushing for the large, deep blue state to leave the union. This state has long been the leader of progressive policies and movements, and with the election of Donald Trump and his supporting regressive federal government, it is looking more and more like California just might be fed up enough to leave the United States permanently.The movement is led by the Yes California Independence campaign, and they have been given the green light to begin collecting signatures to get on the ballot. Thanks to the fact that the Trump administration wants to take America back to the dark ages where people of color are more disenfranchised than ever, where LGBTQ people are subjected to abuses like conversion therapy and routinely discriminated against, where women have no reproductive rights   well, let s just say the idea just got a whole hell of a lot less far-fetched. It s not a stretch to believe that the majority of Californians do not want to live under the tyranny of Trump and Pence and the GOP Congress.The green light is a sign that this could really happen. Yes California has 180 days to rack up 585,407 signatures to be on the ballot in time for the 2018 election. If they get this passed via the voters, there will be another election specifically to decide whether or not California wishes to be its own country. In that instance the state would repeal the part of the state constitution that says that the United States Constitution is the  supreme law of the land,   as well as law codifying California as an  inseparable part of the United States. On the one hand, this sounds like some kind of liberal utopia, and if it were to happen, I d personally be there in a heartbeat. On the other hand, the remaining parts of the United States would be subjected to Christofascist GOP rule for the rest of eternity, because California is a key state when it comes to delivering Democratic victories in presidential races, with its 55 electoral votes. Further, it could lead to a Brexit-like breakdown of the United States, which could spell trouble for democracy at large, with the break-up of countries like the United States and alliances like the European Union. This could be a world-destabilizing force.Either way, it could be interesting to watch, and one must wonder how a huge state like California, which has the world s sixth largest economy, would be stopped from leaving the GOP-infested hellhole that Trump and Pence are sure to turn America into in short order.Featured image via KTLA",News,28-Jan-17
 Facebook Founder Tells Trump to go F*ck Himself In A HUGE Way (SCREENSHOTS),"Donald Trump is horrible, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is not at all shy in letting the world know that. My great grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland. Priscilla s parents were refugees from China and Vietnam. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that,  Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook Friday.  Like many of you, I m concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump. Zuckerberg, of course, is referecing Donald Trump s recent executive orders authorizing the gigantic waste of taxpayer dollars that is his border wall, a partial ban on Muslims entering the United States, and even concentration camps for his planned massive immigrant roundup. We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat,  the Facebook CEO continued.  Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don t pose a threat will live in fear of deportation. We should also keep our doors open to refugees and those who need help. That s who we are,  Zuckerberg says.  Had we turned away refugees a few decades ago, Priscilla s family wouldn t be here today. Though he is critical of Trump s horrible stance and actions, Zuckerberg says he is glad to hear that Trump plans to  work something out  for DREAMers, adding that he hopes the protections available to them survive the Trump administration and that he is glad Trump says he feels the United States should benefit from people of great talent coming into the country. These issues are personal for me even beyond my family. A few years ago, I taught a class at a local middle school where some of my best students were undocumented. They are our future too. We are a nation of immigrants, and we all benefit when the best and brightest from around the world can live, work and contribute here,  Zuckerberg adds.  I hope we find the courage and compassion to bring people together and make this world a better place for everyone.

 It’s Official: Trump Just Created His Muslim Ban Without Ever Creating An Actual Ban On Muslims,"We know that Trump wants to ban Muslims from being able to enter the U.S. at all, but faces significant hurdles to actually do it. So he just did an end run around all those obstacles by instituting what he keeps calling  extreme vetting,  because he apparently believes that our current vetting process for refugees is not only non-existent, but preferential towards Muslims, and discriminatory towards Christians.Today, he signed two executive orders   one to spur new defense spending, and another to ban visa entries from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen (but not countries where he has business, because of course), and to institute  extreme vetting  for refugees: I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. We don t want them here.We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people. Can we say Muslim ban? There s the above, plus Trump actually told the Christian Broadcasting Network s David Brody the following: [Syrian Christians have] been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them. There are a lot of conclusions that can be drawn from that alone, but aside from Trump s insane lie namely that we deliberately discriminate against Christians this action sounds an awful lot like a precursor to his Muslim ban. If he were to support Sen. Tom Cotton s bill that would allow religious minorities to apply directly for refugee status here, while Muslim refugees would likely still have to go through the U.N., suddenly Muslims have a harder time getting here than anyone else.It s true that we get a lot more Muslim refugees than Christian refugees, but there s a reason for that and it s not because we re favoring Muslims. Currently, refugees are generally referred to the United States via the United Nations  refugee camp in Jordan   they don t apply to the U.S. directly. It s a majority Muslim region   therefore most applicants are going to be Muslims.Christians then go to the more urban areas where they re likely to be safer, and they might be coming into the U.S. by way of other immigration pathways.Put all of these things together, along with Republicans  desire to end funding for the U.N., and we re most of the way to an out-and-out Muslim ban without actually creating a law or an edict that bans Muslims.Featured image by Olivier Douliery via Getty Images",News,27-Jan-17
 Trump’s Approval Rating Drops AGAIN To New Record Low,"Gallup Polling recently had Donald Trump s approval rating at a dismal 45 percent   the lowest for any newly inaugurated president in modern American history. Similarly, the poll also had Trump s disapproval rating 45 percent, the highest for any newly inaugurated president in modern American history.It s safe to say that Trump is not off to a good start.And his ratings are only falling further.According to a new Quinnipiac University poll, Donald Trump s approval ratings stand at a disastrous 36 percent, which is, as stated above, the lowest for any new president in modern history. Furthermore, 44 percent of Americans have a negative view of him. That s a net negative eight points.At this same time in his presidency in 2009, Barack Obama had a 59 percent approval rating, and a 29 percent disapproval rating.If there s one thing that Donald Trump cannot stand, it s being hated or mocked. We learned that after his fury over the size of the Women s Marches, and his need to Photoshop the size of his hands.The poll also found that the majority of Americans do not think he has the right qualities to lead the nation, nor do they think he will be good for country. However, the majority of respondents are somehow optimistic about his presidency, and think he will be good for the economy (they probably haven t heard about his 20 percent tariff on Mexican imports).Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said: Stumbling out of the blocks, President Donald Trump is considered a divider not a uniter, flunking on honesty, empathy and level headedness, while his predecessor sees his legacy burnished by better and better numbers every polling cycle. But voters are optimistic in general and confident he will help the economy. Being unfavorably compared to President Obama will no doubt hurt Trump s fragile, thin-skinned ego.The American people are not liking what they re seeing from the authoritarian-in-chief. Judging by how it s going right now, it will only continue to get worse. So far, Trump has signaled that he has no desire whatsoever to change his ways. We re stuck with a fact-suppressing, executive-order signing, loudmouthed fascist for the foreseeable future.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,27-Jan-17
 House Dems To White House Counsel: Trump’s Gag Orders Break Federal Laws – Lots Of Them,"Donald Trump has placed gag orders on multiple federal agencies, telling them to not only cut off communication with the public and the press but also with members of Congress. Go figure, that didn t sit very well with some people, especially since that happens to be illegal. And two House Democrats have decided to take action.Rep. Elijah Cummings and Rep. Frank Pallone sent a letter to the White House Counsel asking that they  take immediate action to remedy the Trump Administration s apparent violations of multiple federal laws by imposing gag orders on federal employees that prevent them from communicating with Congress. The letter explained that the  gag orders appear to violate the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act  as well as the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016  because they do not include a mandatory statement  explaining that employees are still allowed to talk to members of Congress and Inspectors General.The letter points out that the Consolidated Appropriations Act also states that if a federal employee tries to stop another federal employee from speaking to Congress about anything job related, they forfeit their salary.Cummings and Pallone cite  a memo issued by the Acting Secretary of the Department of Health and human Services on President Trump s first day in office,  which states: No correspondence to public officials (e.g. Members of Congress, Governors) or containing interpretations or statements of Department regulations or policy, unless specifically authorized by me or my designee, shall be sent between now and February 3. The congressmen write that this memo and similar restrictions placed on federal agencies such as the Departments of Interior, Transportation, and Agriculture,  appears to violate all of these laws. Cummings and Pallone then urged the Trump administration to  immediately rescind all  of the illegal gag orders. They added that  because of the magnitude of these problematic directives, we request that the President issue an official statement making clear to all federal employees that they have the right to communicate with Congress and that he and his Administration will not silence or retaliate against whistleblowers.

 Malia Obama Is Getting Political And Standing Up Against Trump,"Less than a week after her father left office on a nearly historically high approval rating,  First Daughter Malia Obama is dipping her hat into politics, sort of.According to the former President, both his daughters were  disappointed  that Donald Trump won, but they are both still hopeful. Malia is taking that hope and standing up for the Native Americans at Standing Rock.Malia, who s now 18, skipped a well-earned post presidential family vacation and opted instead to go to the Sundance Film Festival. It was there, in Park City, Utah, where Malia joined a protest against Trump and against the oil companies insisting on putting a pipeline through sacred land.And this past Monday, just four days after her father vacated the Oval Office, Malia made it clear just how disappointed she was in the new commander-in-chief by joining a rally protesting his plans to revive the Dakota Access pipeline project.The 18-year-old student, who will be heading off to Harvard University later this year, was one of approximately 100 people who gathered on Main Street at the Sundance Film Festival to let it be known how upset she was with President Trump s plan to move forward with the controversial transport system.The group braved the blistering cold and heavy snowfall as they held up signs reading  Exist. Resist. Rise.  and  Impeach corporate control. Source: Daily MailLast month, members of the Standing Rock Sioux nation were celebrating after the United States Army announced they would not approve the easement for the pipeline s construction. This was after months of protests.In his first week in office, Donald Trump reversed that decision and chose to screw the Standing Rock Sioux by signing an executive order that would allow the pipeline to go forward. That s what Malia is protesting. Look for this to be the first in a brilliant young woman s life as an activist, if not a politician.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images.",News,27-Jan-17
 Twitter Just Tore Trump To Shreds After His Horrible Holocaust Statement (TWEETS),"If you didn t know, Friday was Holocaust Remembrance Day   a day in which we remember the victims of a man who was very much like our current President*. Surprisingly, someone on Donald Trump s staff took time away from celebrating the  other side  of that battle and put out a halfhearted, generic, and disrespectful statement on his behalf   one which Trump then made his own by tweeting it the American people:Statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day: https://t.co/KjU0MOxCHk  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2017Trump s statement is three paragraphs long and reads like it was written by the same guy who has been writing his executive orders   white supremacist Steve Bannon. Trump says he wants to honor the  victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust    though many of his neo-Nazi supporters would surely disagree with others on the identities of the  heroes  of the Holocaust. Notably, Trump didn t specifically mention Jewish people a single time   a clear fan service for the Klansmen and Sieg Heilers who rally behind him.Trump concludes with a pledge to do  everything  in his power to  ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good.  For instance, if a thin-skinned egomaniac backed by an army of neo-Nazis, Christofascists, and other assorted terrible people teamed up with a foreign dictator to manipulate the election and place himself in the Oval Office so he can build a walkl to keep brown people out of the country, ban people of a specific religion from entering, and generally abuse the powers of the office to make the bigoted dreams of his deplorable supporters come to life Trump would totally put a stop to that. Together, we will make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world,  said the man who is   Holocaust Remembrance Day   signing an executive order banning refugees from countries he thinks have too many Muslims.If this all seems crazy and hypocritical to you, you re not the only one.

 Conway: Mexico Won’t Pay For The Wall Because They Want To Keep Drugs ‘Pouring’ Into America (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s wall is a stupid, money-wasting idea only an idiot would pay for, but unfortunately said idiot has our nation s checkbook in his hand. Recently, Trump signed an executive order written by white supremacist Steve Bannon that begins diverting taxpayer money   your money   to pay for his gigantic monument to bigotry along our southern border with vague promises that our neighbors will pay for it.Unfortunately for Trump, Mexico didn t get the memo about paying for the wall. More correctly, they got the memo and told President Asterisk to go f*ck himself. After Trump signed his executive order, Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto announced that he was canceling a planned meeting between himself and our petulant child of an alleged President. Mexico does not believe in walls. I ve said it time and time again: Mexico will not pay for any wall, Pe a Nieto said in a video posted Wednesday. He also pledged support for any immigrants herded into the literal concentration camps authorized by Trump s order or who are otherwise mistreated by the United States under Trump s rule.Now, most people would view Pe a Nieto as a man who recognizes the tremendous waste associated with build a wall to keep people out when the trend has been that more Mexicans leave than come into our country for quite some time   or someone who refuses to sign on to such a horrifically bigoted plan. But Trump s propaganda minister Kellyanne Conway has a different explanation   Mexicans are all drug dealers and Pe a Nieto wants nothing more than to keep them flowing into our country from his. Well they don t want it, Gayle, because they want to continue to allow people and I assume drugs, since they re not doing much to stop that, pouring over our borders,  Conway told CBS on Friday. We have to look at America. Mexico should pay for that wall because they get an awful lot from this country through NAFTA and through other monetary disbursements. Conway says that if Mexico doesn t jump on board with Trump s racist plan because we can retaliate easily because  the number one source of income into Mexico are Mexicans working here and sending the money back.

 GOP Congressman DEFIES Trump With BLISTERING Attack On His Voter Fraud Investigation (VIDEO),"Early this morning, Donald Trump was up to his usual nonsense on Twitter, spreading misinformation and stroking his ego. Today, he took a break from trying to convince America that the size of his inauguration crowd was respectable and once again complained about not winning the popular vote.In doing so, Trump brought up his tired, pathetic voter fraud conspiracy because he s incapable of dealing with the fact that most of America hates him. In a tweet, Trump brought up his completely unnecessary, expensive and wasteful investigation into a matter that has been debunked several times:For the record, Gregg Phillips is a random dude on Twitter that runs a voter fraud conspiracy app called Voter Stand, and the information that Trump is referring to was officially debunked in November. Phillips even admitted that there was no proof of voter fraud in an interview with Politifact.Trump s voter fraud conspiracy has been condemned by both Democrats and Republicans alike, and earlier today Republican Illinois Congressman Adam Kinzinger took Trump to task on CNN s New Day. In a blistering rant, Kinzinger stated that by spreading this false information and investigating  voter fraud , Trump was undermining America s electoral system and Constitution. Kinzinger, who was one of the few Republicans that would not endorse Trump, said: This basically undermines the idea of an election, this undermines the Constitution. Just as I was upset about the Russian hacking because it s an attack on the election system of our constitution, I don t like this. Kinzinger also slammed Trump for failing to bring forth any real proof that massive voter fraud took place. He said, You have to show why you re undermining the constitution  just show us the proof before you make the accusation.

" WATCH: Dem Senator BLASTS Trump, Calls Him A Liar Live On Air","Senator Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) has about had it with Donald Trump trying to mislead the American people with conspiracy theories, crazy tweets, and outright lies. Appearing on CNN s OutFront with Erin Burnett, Senator Booker lit into Trump and his staff s habit of blatantly lying to the American public. Booker told the host: A week in office and we have seen the President of the United States and his officials repeatedly lying to the American public and pushing out what could be called   what we ve seen in other regimes throughout history   what can be called propaganda to mislead the public. He needs to be called out on it, and we, as an American public, should not accept a president that routinely lies, blatantly, to the American people. When Burnett asked if Senator Booker felt the same way as Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) that Trump is actually delusional, Booker didn t hedge at all, and called Trump a liar: I don t know his mental state. What I do know is he a liar, repeatedly so. Senator Booker also said that he thinks that Trump s message and actions are championing an agenda  that is not in concert with honor or with the facts. Senator Booker is correct. This is the same kind of thing that autocrats do everywhere. They lie to the public, sow discord, division, and fear, and do all they can to discredit any and all other sources of information that do not support their narrative. If we want to survive a Trump presidency with our democracy in tact, we must continue to call Trump and his team out for the lying propagandists that they are.Thank you Senator Booker, for doing what is right.

 Trump Seriously Just Said Waterboarding Is Okay Because It’s Not ‘REAL Torture’ (VIDEO),"On the campaign trail, Donald Trump said he wanted to bring back waterboarding. Now, as president, he is doubling down and says that waterboarding is a-okay because it isn t really even torture anyway.During an interview on Thursday, Trump told Fox News  Sean Hannity that waterboarding doesn t qualify as  real torture  (it does) and claimed that it is an effective interrogation tool to get valuable information (it s not). I mean, torture is real torture, OK? Waterboarding is   I m sure it s not pleasant, but waterboarding was just short of torture,  Trump said.  When   you know, all of a sudden, they made it torture. I spoke with people the other day who are in this world that were talking about it. Absolutely, it works. Absolutely,  he added.Trump told ABC News earlier this week that he is all about bringing back banned torture techniques, such as waterboarding, and said that he will be relying on the advice of his national security team. But he made it clear that he has no doubt in his mango tinted mind that torture works. However, Secretary of Defense James Mattis has long since denounced the practice of waterboarding. As far as I m concerned, we have to fight fire with fire. Now, with that being said I m going with General Mattis. I m going with my secretary because I think Pompeo s gonna be phenomenal. I m gonna go with what they say,  Trump said. But I have spoken as recently as 24 hours ago with people at the highest level of intelligence. And I asked them the question,  Does it work? Does torture work?  And the answer was,  Yes, absolutely,    he added. I will rely on General Mattis. And I m gonna rely on those two people and others. And if they don t wanna do it, it s 100 percent okay with me. Do I think it works? Absolutely. Once again, Trump is using alternative facts. Not only does waterboarding most definitely constitute torture, but it also isn t effective when it comes to getting information. According to a report published by US Senate Select Committee published in 2014, which analyzed the CIA s detention and interrogation program, torture does not work.The report clearly states that the  use of the CIA s enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of obtaining accurate information or gaining detainee cooperation. The report also points out that people who are tortured often make up false information just to bring an end to their suffering. They will tell you whatever you want to hear to get you to stop hurting them (even if it isn t true) because they are desperate.You can watch Trump declare that waterboarding is not  real torture,  here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,27-Jan-17

" After Months Of Concern Trolling, Trump Proves He Really Thinks Chicago Murders Are HILARIOUS","Amid one of the most racist presidential campaigns in modern history, Donald Trump spent a lot of time apparently attempting to appeal to African-Americans by telling them they live in poor, murderous hellholes called,  inner cities.  By and large, they don t.Trump seems particularly concerned about one city: Chicago. Now, Chicago s murder rate is on the rise, there s no question there, but it s not the most murderous city. It s not even close. So what is it about Chicago?Murder rates are up across the country. The biggest jumps in murder rates have been in cities that Trump doesn t call hellscapes. In fact, he doesn t talk about the rising murder rate in these cities at all. Not coincidentally, they are all in states that voted for Trump. Oh, and did I mention that Chicago is President Obama s home town?Among the notable rises outside of Chicago were increases of 56 percent in Memphis, 61 percent in San Antonio, 44 percent in Louisville, 36 percent in Phoenix and 31 percent in Las Vegas. Taken together, those six cities accounted for 76 percent of the overall big city murder rise in 2016.In all there were six big cities   Louisville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Anchorage, Alaska; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Durham, North Carolina; and Indianapolis   that appear to have set records for highest murder counts in one year dating back to 1960.3 There were also at least 16 big cities that tied or surpassed their worst murder years since the start of 2000 in 2016.Source: FiveThirtyEightStill, Republicans insist on holding up Chicago as the perfect symbol of blacks behaving badly and they love it. In fact, on Thursday, Trump and a group of Republicans had a big hearty laugh at the expense of Chicago s dead.

 The United States Government Has Told Trump To Go F*CK Himself,"When Trump began his disinformation campaign and then started trying to muzzle federal agencies, employees of some of these agencies went to Twitter to openly defy him. They call themselves AltGov, and there are dozens of these accounts that are making a point of pushing out the very facts that Trump wishes would disappear, as well as openly fighting his  alternative facts,  and overall disinformation campaign. Many have been verified by Snopes, who now keeps a running list of trusted AltGov accounts.However, no matter who they are, they are all very clear about the fact that they are not doing this on behalf of their agencies. They re operating these accounts independently and are not official U.S. government Twitter accounts, and they re dedicated to maintaining the flow of information from the government to the people that we enjoyed under previous administrations (Please note: Their work does not appear to include any sensitive information, and they appear to be very careful to keep it that way).Below are some of the agencies and departments where members of AltGov work, have inside knowledge of, or can otherwise speak the truth about what the government is doing:There are also two alternate accounts dedicated to sending out facts under the name Alt.

 Hackers Reveal Trump Linked The Most Powerful Twitter In The World To A Personal Gmail Account (TWEETS),"Donald Trump s administration is already proving to be a complete and utter sh*tshow, but did you know his Twitter security is just as bad as his leadership? The Intercept reports that Donald Trump s Twitter account   that s the one used by the President of the United States   was until today  secured  with a simple Gmail account.Hacker @WauchulaGhost, Trump s @POTUS account was set to a personal gmail apparently belonging to Dan Scavino as well as one that appears to be connected to Donald Trump s website:Hey @POTUS, On a serious note. Lets fix your Security settings. Should I email you? #GhostOfNoNation @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/FRdMJnZaNr  WauchulaGhost (@WauchulaGhost) January 21, 2017Ghost says that @POTUS, @FLOTUS, and @VP are all vulnerable to attacks because the administration that says it will make our country more secure hasn t bothered to set up the most basic security features on the accounts. CNN spoke to the hacker, who shared some grim details about exactly how inept the current administration is:According to WauchulaGhost, @POTUS, @FLOTUS and @VP are more vulnerable because they haven t selected a basic security feature on Twitter that requires you to provide a phone number or email address to reset your password. The current security setting for these three accounts allows anyone to click on  forgot password  and type in @FLOTUS, @POTUS or @VP. The next screen says  we found the following information associated with your account  and gives a partially redacted email address to which it will send a password recovery link.WauchulaGhost says being able to fill in the missing letters and guess someone s email address is the first step hackers take when trying to breach an account. It s not hard for us to go figure out that email,  he told CNNTech in a Twitter direct message.  I ve taken over 500 Islamic State accounts. WauchulaGhost says he found the likely email associated with Melania Trump s handle within twenty minutes. He said the email associated with Vice President Mike Pence was easy to guess once you saw the redacted version: vi***************@gmail.com, which WauchulaGhost pieced together as [email protected] It has since been changed, but the president and first lady s email addresses remain the same. (And the VP account still doesn t have the extra layer of security.)After news broke that Trump had his account connected to gmail, someone on his end rapidly changed email addresses but still didn t change security features, which was kind of fun for Twitter:So I'm thinking it's dstrumppresident2017(@)gmail(.) pic.twitter.com/n3HJm6Bxwr  Alexandra Svokos (@asvokos) January 26, 2017UPDATE: Second email account added to @POTUS pic.twitter.com/TcqfLHAfkW  Alexandra Svokos (@asvokos) January 26, 2017Update 2: Gmail account now taken off @POTUS.

On top of that, members of his administration have already been busted using private RNC email accounts of their own, placing our nation at risk. On top of that, Trump still uses his own unsecured Android phone to tweet from his personal account.How can we expect Donald Trump to run the country when he can t even manage his own Twitter account?featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla)/screengrab",News,26-Jan-17
 WATCH: Jake Tapper SHOCKED By Steve Bannon Saying Press Should Shut Up – Gives BRILLIANT Response,"Steve Bannon has a clear, strong agenda for Trump s relationship with the press. The far-right white supremacist just did a rare interview with The New York Times, which is ironic considering how much he seems to hate the press, and he took the opportunity to paint the press as an incompetent enemy. In that interview, he said, point-blank: The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while. Listen to what? More of Trump s lies? The press should let his lies go unchallenged? Just for the record, the press does not like being told they can t challenge public figures. The press does not like being muzzled.So, one member of the press, CNN s Jake Tapper, responded to that with something thoughtful and eloquent, yet appropriately brief. Watch below: No    @jaketapper to Steve Bannon pic.twitter.com/VT2tfyTm3q  Colin Jones (@colinjones) January 26, 2017And he s laughing at the very notion of shutting up and listening. It s brilliant in the face of Bannon saying,  Sit down, shut up, and let him lie all he wants.  That s really what it comes down to   letting the administration put forth unchecked lies so they can create the reality they want. In fact, Bannon actually told the Times to quote him on this: I want you to quote this,  Mr. Bannon added.  The media here is the opposition party. They don t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.  [emphasis mine]So the media should shut up. Stop with the criticism. Stop with the challenges. It hurts Donald s little feefees and we just can t have that.Too bad for them that the press isn t going to listen.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,26-Jan-17
 Trump Considering Incredibly Ironic Choice For Vatican Ambassadorship (DETAILS),"Another day in the Trump Administration means another day of sheer insanity.As Trump begins to name ambassadors to various positions across the globe, one sticks out above all: Callista Gingrich, wife of former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.Aside from having no diplomatic experience whatsoever, Gingrich is an interesting choice for her perspective position  Ambassador to Holy See. Newt Gingrich confirmed to CNN that his wife was  being considered  and said if chosen, he would not be moving to Rome, but instead be  clocking in  a lot of miles between Italy and the United States.The Holy See, which is comprised of the Vatican and the Roman Catholic Church overall, is arguably one of the most important relationships between the United States and the western Judeo-Christian religious order.And in typical Trump form, he nominates someone who is the antithesis of what the position holds dear. Why? For starters, Callista Gingrich is an adulteress.Gingrich, who met her husband Newt when he was House Minority Whip, admitted to engaging in a six year extramarital affair while the Speaker was married to his second wife, Marianne Ginther.So not only is Callista Gingrich an adulteress, she is married to a twice-divorced adulterer, both of which are grave sins in the Roman Catholic Church.Gingrich and her husband are both  staunch Catholics,  and are allowed to receive communion, as Newt had his first two marriages annulled   effectively absolving all wrongdoing in the eyes of God and the church.Still, the decision to hand Callista Gingrich the position of Ambassador to the Holy See is pathetic, given the many Catholic lawmakers and diplomats are currently and formally serving in Washington D.C. and have much more experience.There are currently 24 Catholic members of the Senate alone, including Republicans Pat Toomey, Lisa Murkowski, Marco Rubio, John Hoeven, Thom Tillis, Dan Sullivan, Mike Rounds and Susan Collins.Once again, Donald Trump is considering a joke to lead a very serious and very sacred position in American diplomacy. Why? Because he has favors to pay. Newt Gingrich was one of Trump s biggest mouthpieces throughout the campaign.This is what we call dynasty politics. This is what we call the  swamp  in Washington D.C. God help us (no pun intended) if Callista Gingrich is given this position.Featured image via Peter Marovich/Getty Images",News,26-Jan-17

 Madeleine Albright: ‘I Will Register As A Muslim’ In Solidarity,"Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has pledged to register as a Muslim should Trump succeed in setting up such a registry   which he promised on the campaign trail.The 79-year-old former diplomat and Czech immigrant took to Twitter on Wednesday to protest Donald Trump s executive action that bars refugee status of immigration for people from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen and so forth. Albright, a refugee herself from communist Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic), wrote:I was raised Catholic, became Episcopalian & found out later my family was Jewish. I stand ready to register as Muslim in #solidarity.  Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) January 25, 2017Simply put, Madeleine Albright is a badass.This isn t the first time Albright   a Clinton supporter   has taken Donald Trump to task.During the campaign, Albright made headlines when she described Trump and his campaign as  Putin s useful idiot,  a term that is more evident today than ever.Albright also made numerous postings on Twitter defending refugees:There is no fine print on the Statue of Liberty. America must remain open to people of all faiths & backgrounds. #RefugeesWelcome pic.twitter.com/4LvMiZTRJJ  Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) January 25, 201719 national security leaders agree: Congress must not make refugees the enemy. https://t.co/DkGPlkrPnW #RefugeesWelcome  Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) December 1, 2015Albright s Twitter describes her as a  Grateful American, Czech immigrant, mother & grandmother, fmr SecState, passionate democrat, author, prof, bizwoman, pin collector & occasional drummer.

 Newt Gingrich Says Federal Workers Who Voted For Hillary Clinton Will Be Fired,"Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker of the House who resigned in shame and turned into Trump s biggest cheerleader, has a new litmus test to determine if a federal worker keeps their job: did they vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?While discussing the Trump Administration s budget   in which $10.5 trillion will be cut fro, various government programs   Gingrich told the Heritage Foundation that in order to balance the relationship between Trump and the bureaucracy, federal workers who voted for or supported Clinton would be fired: All those bureaucrats overwhelmingly voted for Clinton. There won t be any real cooperation until we change federal law so we can fire them. The budget, which is modeled after the Heritage Foundation s, is seeking to nearly cut all discretionary spending to every federal bureaucracy, which includes federal agency budget cuts by 10 percent and employee cuts by 20 percent. Coincidentally, 20 percent of the federal workforce is black, and almost 90 percent of blacks voted for Clinton.But, again, I m sure it s just a coincidence The dog whistle is becoming louder and louder. The fact that this revelation isn t making widespread headlines is a failure of mainstream journalism. A former powerful politician with close ties to the current Administration is advocating for the firing of people with different political affiliations.This is a political witch hunt that mirrors the dark days of McCarthyism. Because someone doesn t subscribe to the racist, sexist, xenophobic and authoritarian regime that is the Trump presidency they risk losing their job doing low level, non-political jobs.Whatever happened to the Republican mantra that people be judged based on their ethics and results? In Trump s America, it s all about blind patriotism and racism.Blind ideology, suppression of facts and science, and now vendettas. The GOP has become a vehicle for a fascist authoritarian regime, and Trump is leading the movement.Remember when the GOP was outraged that the IRS was  targeting  conservative groups for their political affiliations? Why aren t Democrats more outraged over this rank hypocrisy?The resistance starts with resisting everyone in Trump s camp, not just Trump himself.Featured image via Flickr",News,26-Jan-17
 Mexican President Just Told Trump To F*ck Right Off (TWEETS/VIDEO),"Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto was scheduled to meet with Trump on January 31, but that isn t happening anymore.

 HOLY F*CK: Trump Literally Has A White Nationalist Writing His Executive Orders,"This may shock you, this may not, but Trump has been delegating the duty of writing his executive orders to some scary people   well, a scary person, that is.If you thought executive orders limiting Muslim entry into the United States, stripping health international organizations of federal funds if they so much as mention abortion, authorizing the building of literal f*cking concentration camps to hold the  illegals  The Donald intends to round up, and beginning the process of stripping health care from millions of impoverished Americans sounded like Breitbart s Christmas list come to life, you were exactly right.According to White House aides, Trump has been delegating the duty of writing the rapid stream of absolutely f*cking terrifying executive orders to the same guy who ran Breitbart. Trump s Chief Strategist and former executive chair called his publication  a platform for the alt-right  (for those who are unaware,  alt-right  means  Nazi )   and the views that would be associated with one who cultivates that sort of cesspool are definitely making themselves apparent in the nature of Trump s orders.Things are a mess in the White House at the moment. According to Politico, no one seems to have any idea what the hell they are doing or, more importantly, what Trump is doing with his flawed orders that might be unworkable, unenforceable or even illegal :Just a small circle of officials at the Department of Health and Human Services knew about the executive action starting to unwind Obamacare, and only less than two hours before it was released. Key members of Congress weren t consulted either, according to several members. And at a conference in Philadelphia, GOP legislators say they had no idea whether some of the executive orders would contrast with existing laws   because they hadn t reviewed them.The breakneck pace of Trump s executive actions might please his supporters, but critics are questioning whether the documents are being rushed through without the necessary review from agency experts and lawmakers who will bear the burden of actually carrying them out. For example, there are legal questions on how the country can force companies building pipelines to use materials manufactured domestically, which might not be available or which could violate trade treaty obligations. There s also the question of whether the federal government can take billions from cities who don t comply with immigration enforcement actions: Legal experts said it was unclear.Aides say that it is often difficult to know what order Trump intends to sign at any given moment or even what is in some of them because of the secretive nature in which they are being drafted by Bannon and the small circle of friends Trump has handling them.To make matters worse, Bannon is in the process of a huge power grab right now, giving two of his former staffers at the white supremacist hate rag seats at the table. The Hill reports:One of Breitbart s biggest stars, Julia Hahn, is expected to join the White House as an aide to Bannon. Breitbart s national security editor, Sebastian Gorka, will also relocate to the White House, likely with a spot on the president s National Security Council, Business Insider reported on Tuesday.The Breitbartization of the White House comes as no surprise to people at the conservative news site. I m surprised it took this long,  one Breitbart reporter told The Hill.  There are a number of people on staff who clearly have resumes that would lend themselves to the administration. These two are ideologically in line with Bannon. They re people he can trust. It makes sense. There is no line of separation between the White House and Breitbart   they are one in the same,  a former Breitbart spokesman who has since disavowed the right-wing hate factory, told The Hill.  They effectively are a state-sponsored/controlled platform designed to advance the administration s propaganda. And the administration, in turn, is bringing Breitbart s propaganda to life.Featured image via Getty Images/Ben Jackson",News,26-Jan-17
 The Exodus: The State Department’s Entire Senior Management Team Just Quit Over Trump,"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson s better get busy running the State Department because the entire senior level of management officials resigned Wednesday over alleged president Donald Trump. This is only part of the ongoing mass exodus of senior foreign service officers following Trump s election.Trump s team was looking for people to fill Tillerson s Number one and two positions as well as three officials and looking to replace the State Department s undersecretary for management, Patrick Kennedy, The Washington Post reports. Kennedy held that job for nine years and hoped to keep it under Tillerson. He was actively involved in the transition.Then suddenly:Then suddenly on Wednesday afternoon, Kennedy and three of his top officials resigned unexpectedly, four State Department officials confirmed. Assistant Secretary of State for Administration Joyce Anne Barr, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Michele Bond and Ambassador Gentry O. Smith, director of the Office of Foreign Missions, followed him out the door. All are career foreign service officers who have served under both Republican and Democratic administrations.On Jan. 20th, Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Gregory Starr retired. On that same day, the director of the Bureau of Overseas Building Operations, Lydia Muniz, left her position. It s the single biggest simultaneous departure of institutional memory that anyone can remember, and that s incredibly difficult to replicate,  David Wade, who served as State Department chief of staff under Secretary of State John Kerry, told the paper.  Department expertise in security, management, administrative and consular positions in particular are very difficult to replicate and particularly difficult to find in the private sector. Since the election, several senior foreign service officers in the State Department s regional bureaus have also resigned or retired. These retirements are a big loss. They leave a void,  said Wade.  These are very difficult people to replace. This sort of mass exodus has never happened before. It s not a partisan issue. These officials worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations.Meanwhile, our newly minted Twitter-addicted president is busy sending out mean-girl tweets on his unsecured Android and trying to prove that he won the popular vote even though he didn t. There s a madman in the White House and senior officials with the State Department want no part of the former reality show star s presidency.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,26-Jan-17
" IRONY: Trump Calls Chelsea Manning A ‘Traitor’ For Criticizing President Obama, Get HUMILIATED By Twitter","Donald Trump s hypocrisy was thrown square into his face.For eight years, Trump and conservatives repeatedly called President Obama  weak,  not to mention just about every other negative word in the book.But now Trump has the gall to call someone a traitor for criticizing President Obama exactly the same way Trump criticized him all these years.Just before President Obama left office, he commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, an army whistle-blower who was sentenced to serve 25 years in prison for leaking classified documents.Manning has been a critic of Obama, but despite that, President Obama signed off on the commutation anyway. He didn t expect thanks or loyalty in return.But Trump says it is treason to not kiss a president s ass after the president does something nice for you, which gives us a glimpse of what he will expect when it comes time for him to issue pardons and commutations.Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader.

" Disgusted Republicans Unable To Reach UNHINGED Trump, Forced To Tweet Their Complaints At Him (IMAGES)","Donald Trump is already making the Republican Party insane, and it hasn t even been a week yet. While many GOPers found Trump s Twitter use concerning, it s reached an entirely new level considering that Trump is unavailable to them by all other means.On Wednesday, the Republican Party suffered another humiliating blow when Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) was forced to go on Twitter and beg Trump   in front of everyone   to force his executive branch to answer Senators  requests so that oversight could be performed. Grassley tweeted: Pres Trump pls issue order to all in ur executive branch ppl to answer all Senator requests for RECORDS so we can do oversight. This was followed by several pathetic attempts to get Trump to respond, probably because Trump and his team wouldn t play by the rules and answer more conventional methods of communication (no surprise there).Grassley tried everything to get Trump s attention   he even tried to educate the 45th President of the United States about  how important  oversight is, probably because Grassley realizes Trump doesn t know anything about how the government actually works Grassley even tried to diss former President Barack Obama in hopes that Trump would respond! Hours later, Grassley s pleas for Trump to do his job had gone unanswered, and things got a little testy:Damn! But honestly, what did the GOP expect from Trump, the guy who took the weekend off from being president after his inauguration?! This is a man who obviously doesn t care about doing the work of a president; he just wanted the title.Trump s first week has been such a disaster, and it s not even over. He s not only becoming a nightmare for all of Americans and Democrats   he s a liability to his own party.

" Trump Is Building Literal, Actual Concentration Camps For Undocumented Immigrants","It s beginning. While some dismissed Donald Trump s campaign promises to ban Muslims from entering the country, dismantle our country s healthcare, build a giant goddamn motherfucking wall to keep brown people from entering the country, and every other horrific thing you can think of and more as  just words  he was using to get stupid people to vote for him, he meant every single one of them   and he s been proving it.One of President Asterisk s first acts was an executive order that is the beginning of his efforts to dismantle Obamacare. He followed up by signing away our environment and authorizing the building of two controversial pipelines, stripping federal funds from international health organizations that so much as mention abortion (in an order conveniently following millions of women lining the streets to protest him). He then withdrew us from a major trade agreement without a single thought about the repercussions, began funneling our tax dollars into his stupid wall, ordered a weekly report on crimes committed by  aliens  and banned Muslims from seven countries he hates from entering the country.Trump even authorized the building of new camps in which undocumented immigrants could be concentrated   for a limited time, of course   until they could be deported (I feel like there s a term for these things, but I can t quite place it). The Washington Post reports: The presidential directives signed Wednesday aim to create more detention centers, add thousands of Border Patrol agents and withhold federal funds from what are known as sanctuary cities, which do not comply with federal immigration laws. One order calls for the  immediate construction of a physical wall. In short, if you re a member of this group that Trump considers undesirable, you ll be sent to one of these camps and any city that might otherwise harbor you will face extreme penalties for doing so. We are going to restore the rule of law in the United States,  Trump told a crowd of DHS employees Wednesday.  Beginning today, the United States gets control of its borders. Trump also vowed to investigate alleged voter fraud in blue states   particularly in  urban  (that s right-wing slang for  black ) areas   so he can prove once and forgodamnall that he actually won the popular vote, because he really is that petty.It hasn t even been a week since Trump took office and he has already made it clear that he has declared war on the American people. The question remains: just how much are we going to take of this bullshit?Make no mistake about it: people will die in Trump s camps and his supporters will applaud.This. Is. Not. OK.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)",News,26-Jan-17
 Trump Gets SMOKED After Telling The American People It’s His Duty To Protect Their Lives,"Donald Trump just posted an outright lie on Twitter addressed to the American people and got righteously taken to the woodshed for it.Since the first day of his dictatorship, Trump has been busy signing executive orders at a pace goes beyond what President Obama did throughout his eight years in office. Trump has ordered federal agencies to start dismantling the Affordable Care Act, programs that deal with slowing or stopping climate change, and regulations that provide Americans with clean air and clean water.In addition, Trump is an ally of the anti-vaccination movement, has placed USDA scientists who deal with food safety on lockdown, and wants to defund the Civil Rights division of the Justice Department.Trump is also preparing to withdraw the United States from the United Nations, is escalating confrontation with China, and has suggested he will weaken NATO.But Trump insisted on Wednesday night that he is doing his duty to protect American lives.As your President, I have no higher duty than to protect the lives of the American people. pic.twitter.com/o7YNUNwb8f  Donald J.

And most Americans are not fooled.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,25-Jan-17
 Trump STUNS An Entire Room Into DUMBFOUNDED Silence With His ‘Proof’ Of Voter Fraud,"Trump won the electoral college on Nov. 8. The electoral college formally voted for him on Dec. 19. Congress certified that vote on Jan. 6. And he was sworn in on Jan. 20. He won the election so why is he still beating his  I only lost the popular vote because millions voted illegally,  drum? He s so obsessed with it that he s promised to open up a major investigation into the massive voter fraud that supposedly denied him his rightful popular vote win:I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017Where the hell is President Asterisk getting his info? It seems he s certain that voter fraud is rampant because he saw something in a polling place once. He supposedly saw Bernhard Langer, a famous golfer, down in Florida sometime after Election Day. Langer told him a story of how he was turned away at the polls, but others were allowed to cast provisional ballots and he was frustrated.The first glaring problem here is this: Langer is a legal permanent resident, but a German citizen, and is therefore barred from voting in national elections. If he did try to vote on Election Day, an official would have been legally obligated to turn Langer away.But still, according to The New York Times: Ahead of and behind Mr. Langer were voters who did not look as if they should be allowed to vote, Mr. Trump said, according to the staff members   but they were nonetheless permitted to cast provisional ballots. The president threw out the names of Latin American countries that the voters might have come from. Because someone s appearance is totally how you can tell whether they re legally allowed to vote here. Of course Trump would focus on how people look. It seems that, in his mind, if they appear to be Latino, they re obviously in the country illegally.And people with more than half a brain cell know that s stupid. Trump told the story to a room full of Congressional leaders at a  get to know you  gathering in the State Dining room. The Times says that this little anecdote was greeted with silence. Then Reince Priebus tried to nudge Trump onto a different topic.This is where Trump is getting his proof that millions of people vote illegally in this country? Anecdotes like this, that might not even be true, are why we re going to waste time and effort on a claim that s been debunked repeatedly, just so he can make people stop pointing to numbers that show he s a loser?ABC News is reporting that the White House has started working on an executive order to open just such an investigation. With all of this, one would think Trump has at least some solid evidence that there s widespread voter fraud. He doesn t.He is way out of hand and he hasn t even been in office for a week.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images",News,25-Jan-17
 Snowflake Trump Whines Because The Media And Protesters Won’t Let Him ‘Enjoy’ Being President,"Seriously. Apparently, he thought being president would automatically make everyone love him.The Women s March on Washington was clearly several times larger than Donald Trump s inauguration. In fact, it was so big that it happened around the world.Trump has been absolutely obsessed with his crowd size since inauguration day just like he is still obsessing over losing the popular vote on Election Day in November.The bottom line is that Trump is an illegitimate president and the truth hurts.And according to White House sources who spoke to the Associated Press, Trump has been whining about the massive protests and media coverage against him because he can t  enjoy  being president as long as both continue to occur.After relishing in Friday s inaugural festivities, the new president grew increasingly upset the next day by what he felt was  biased  media coverage of women s marches across the globe protesting his election, according to a person familiar with his thinking Two people close to Trump said he expected his coverage to turn more favorable once he took office. Instead, he s told people he believes it s gotten worse. The bad press over the weekend has not allowed Trump to  enjoy  the White House as he feels he deserves, according to one person who has spoken with him.If Trump really did not want to be protested, hated, and covered intensely by the media he should not have run for president in the first place. Now he gets to deal with all the pros and cons of the job. Surely, he knew about this stuff prior to throwing his hat in the ring. After all, conservatives constantly attacked President Obama for eight years. Obama also received threats against his life and had all sort of racial epithets hurled at him, something that Trump definitely has not had to deal with.But if Trump wants all the protesting and bad press to stop he has two choices. First, he could simply stop being a dick and start protecting all the progress this country has made over the last 70 years instead of destroying it piece by piece. Or, second, he could just resign.Because the more he whines and the more he tries to restrict the free press, free speech, and the right to protest, the more protests and bad news he will get in return.For some reason, Trump expected everyone to kiss his ass on Election Night and again on inauguration day. He seriously thought he would be adored for destroying the lives of millions of people and embarrassing America around the globe. He assumed the presidency would be just one long vacation and that everyone would worship him and that no one would ever protest him or write something negative about him. In short, he thinks he is the dictator of North Korea, not President of the United States.Donald Trump is a thin-skinned bully, so protests should continue to be a theme over the next years and the free press should get to work telling the truth about Trump every chance it gets. Because the more pissed off he gets, the more clear it will become to the American people that he is totally unfit for the office he holds.Featured image via Specer Platt/Getty Images",News,25-Jan-17
" While We Were Sleeping, Trump Declared Civil War","I woke up this morning completely unfazed over the idea that Donald Trump had yet another overnight Twitter meltdown. After being skewered in the media over his repeated claims that millions of people voted illegally, which is the only reason he lost the popular vote, Trump vowed to investigate.I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017All this, despite the fact that there is no voter fraud.Many, of course, are theorizing that Trump s Twitter tantrums are simply a distraction from his real disasters, and that s true, to a point, but when you dig a little deeper, you ll find something much, much more sinister; Trump is declaring Civil War and three things he s done over the last 24 hours prove it.While threatening to investigate voter fraud might be (and likely is) a distraction, it s more than a threat. It s very specific. He s going after only the states that he didn t win.During Wednesday s White House briefing, Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked about Trump s false claim that millions of fraudulent votes cost him a victory in the popular vote. After that lie was ridiculed Tuesday, Trump tweeted early Wednesday morning that he would order a  major investigation  into voter fraud. But the claim is not just unsupported by any evidence it was contradicted by his own campaign lawyers, who argued there was no evidence of fraud when Green Party nominee Jill Stein sued for a recount in some states. Why should anyone believe him now?Spicer s answer was stunning. There s a lot of states that we didn t compete in where that s not necessarily the case,  he said. You look at California and New York, I m not sure that those statements were we didn t look at those two states in particular   I think when you look at where a lot of places where a lot of these issues could have occurred in bigger states, that s where I think we re going to look. Source: The AtlanticThe second shot fired in the Civil War is against sanctuary cities, or cities where undocumented immigrants can report crimes committed against them without fear of legal retribution. Most of those cities, not surprisingly, are heavily Democratic. Trump signed an executive order that would take away federal funding from states that don t make life a living hell for undocumented immigrants. The majority of sanctuary cities are in firmly blue states, but we ll be curious to see if Trump s threat will come to fruition in red states.The third was on a smaller scale, but in its way, far more frightening. On Tuesday night, Trump quoted some Bill O Reilly statistics and said that he was going to  send in the Feds  to deal with Chicago s violence (Chicago, by the way, doesn t even crack the top 30 in most murderous cities).If Chicago doesn t fix the horrible  carnage  going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017We re still unclear about what  send in the feds  actually means, but the implication is that Trump intends to declare martial law and it might be over a petty feud with Chicago s mayor, Rahm Emanuel. Illinois is also a state that voted for Hillary Clinton.In another time, Republicans would be furious! What Trump is threatening violates state sovereignty. No president has ever won 100 percent of the vote, but we ve never had a president who s threatened those who dared vote against him. We ve especially never had a president who threatened martial law over a political dispute. It s also a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids federal troops from acting as local police except under cases of extreme emergency. If Trump does send troops into Chicago, against the will of the mayor and the governor, it will clearly be an act of war.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,25-Jan-17
 Spineless Speaker: Paul Ryan Caves To Trump’s Most INSANE Campaign Fever Dream (VIDEO),"Just a few months ago, the idea of Donald Trump s actually being able to get Congress to agree to a massive wall along the U.S.-Mexico border seemed like an absolutely insane idea to Democrats and Republicans alike. Now, however, it seems that Trump s crude, nationalistic monument is about to become a reality   and Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan is rolling over like the spineless puppy dog we all know him to be when it comes to Trump, and he insists that Trump s wall will be built. Also, it will come at the cost of the American taxpayer.Sitting down with MSNBC s Greta Van Susteren, Speaker Ryan says of Trump s wall: We re going to pay for it and front the money up. After that, Ryan rambled on about how it s about national security and keeping America safe from immigrants   you know the kind of rhetoric that was unthinkable from an American leader just a few shorts months ago: This is about keeping Americans safe. We are committed to working with the administration to stop the influx of illegal immigration along the southern border, protect our homeland, and uphold the rule of law. I applaud President Trump for keeping his promise to make this a national priority. Then, he went on to agree with the looniest part of Trump s plan   to force Mexico to pay for the wall. Ryan says: There are a lot of different ways of getting Mexico to contribute to doing this. So, let me get this straight   Paul Ryan, who likes to pretend he s one of the reasonable Republicans on Capitol Hill, the guy who people looked to in order to challenge Trump s insanity, is now caving to one of the craziest plans Trump has hatched.If anyone had any comforting delusions that GOPers on The Hill would do anything about Trump s nutty plans, you best get rid of them now and #RESIST.Watch a short clip of the interview below:Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,25-Jan-17

If there was voter fraud, I say let's do it over again!  Joy Behar (@JoyVBehar) January 25, 2017Which is a very honest suggestion that should, in a logical world, make everyone happy. If Trump thinks there was fraud (there wasn t) then he should be in complete agreement with the suggestion of a new election.

 Trump Is Charging Journalists With Felonies For Covering His Inauguration Protests,"In a play right out of Vladimir Putin s Rules for Dictators, Donald Trump is in the process of locking up journalists who don t paint a rosy picture of the Trump administration and his popularity, or lack thereof.So far, six journalists (First Amendment be damned) have been arrested for covering last Saturday s protests that followed Donald Trump s inauguration. If convicted, each of the six could face up to 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine.A documentary producer, a photojournalist, a live-streamer and a freelance reporter were each charged with the most serious level of offense under Washington DC s law against rioting, after being caught up in the police action against demonstrators.The Guardian learned of their arrests after reporting on Monday that the journalists Evan Engel of Vocativ and Alex Rubinstein of RT America had also been arrested and charged with felonies while covering the same unrest on Friday morning.Source: The GuardianClearly, this is a direct violation of the First Amendment. Even if they weren t journalists, it s still legal to protest in this country, but journalists should be assigned even more protection. All they were doing were their jobs. They were recording the protest, not instigating. These charges are clearly inappropriate, and we are concerned that they could send a chilling message to journalists covering future protests,  said Carlos Laur a, the CPJ s senior Americas program coordinator.  We call on authorities in Washington to drop these charges immediately. Trump s apparent role model, Vladimir Putin, has a long and abusive history with journalists in his own country. About a year ago, when Republicans still hated Russia, the conservative blog, The Daily Caller, talked about how in Russia, not only are journalists censored, they far too often end up dead.A 2009 investigation by the International Federation of Journalists reported 96 killings of journalists between 1991 and 2009, by far the highest number among the 20 richest countries in the world.We aren t saying Trump is there. We desperately hope he never goes that far, but his disdain for journalism is public knowledge and his attempts at censorship become more blatant every day. Arresting journalists for simply doing their job is an unacceptable precedent. Please let everyone know.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images.",News,25-Jan-17
 BUSTED: Trump’s Senior WH Staff Have Email Accounts On A Private Server (DETAILS),"When Donald Trump was a running for office, he and his conservative followers repeatedly called for  locking up  Hillary Clinton for handling government work with a private server while secretary of state. Hypocrisy, thy name is GOP. Newsweek is reporting that senior Trump administration staffers have active accounts on a Republican National Committee email system. Kellyanne Conway, Jared Kushner, Sean Spicer and Steve Bannon are among those who are using the system (rnchq.org)   the same one the George W. Bush administration was accused of using in order to evade transparency rules after claiming to have  lost  22 million emails.What they re doing is not illegal but it is ironic.But after then-candidate Donald Trump and the Republicans repeatedly called for  locking up  Hillary Clinton for handling government work with a private server while secretary of state, the new White House staff risks repeating the same mistake that dogged the Democrat s presidential campaign. They also face a security challenge: The RNC email system, according to U.S. intelligence, was hacked during the 2016 race.  They better be careful after making such a huge ruckus over the private email over at the State Department,  says former Bush administration lawyer Richard Painter.And by the way, Hillary Clinton s server use did not violate the law. Still yet, last July, an informal adviser to Donald Trump s presidential campaign called for Hillary Clinton s execution. Al Baldasaro said that Clinton  should be put in the firing line and shot for treason  because of her use of private email server.It s not known yet how the Trump staffers are using the RNC email addresses, however, if they are actively using them then they are subject to the  Disclosure Requirement For Official Business Conducted Using Electronic Messaging Accounts. If White House staffers have already used the RNC emails system for White House work, they must copy or forward those communications into the government system within 20 days.But wait, there s more!The New York Times is reporting that Trump is still using his  old, unsecured Android phone  to take calls and tweet despite  protests from some of his aides. Last night when Trump tweeted that he would send in the Feds  to Chicago, he was using his Android. As for the White House phones, Trump said they are  the world s most secure system,  adding,  The words just explode in the air. Notably, this is the same RNC server that multiple intelligence agencies and officials claim was hacked during the 2016 race.Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images.",News,25-Jan-17
" Washington Post Issues PRICELESS ‘Apology’ To Trump, Puts Out ‘True, Unbiased’ Inauguration Story","The Washington Post, after being repeatedly dragged through the mud at the (tiny) hands of Donald Trump, not to mention also being labeled  fake news,  has decided it owes Trump an apology. They ve (sarcastically) conceded that the press has been mean and has hurt Trump s feelings, and that they ve even lied through their teeth. And they ve published the  true, unbiased  version of Trump s inauguration that he no doubt sincerely believes we should all heed.And it s amazing. It s hilarious. Its sarcasm is over the top, as it should be because Trump s overinflated opinion of himself is over the top. If it wasn t, he wouldn t have told the CIA,  Wait a minute, I made a speech. I looked out, the field was   it looked like a million, million and a half people. The Post s story addresses all of this and more with hilarious abandon. Written by Alexandra Petri, it starts off with an abject apology: I apologize to Donald Trump. As Sean Spicer so wisely said at his first news conference on Monday (It was the first. The one that happened on Saturday did not happen at all, and I recognize that!), it is unfair to be so mean and negative all the time.Here is the fair and unbiased story about the inauguration written in compliance with the Trump style guidelines that we should have been obeying all along. She also  reports  on the  apology  that all the media gave to Trump, which touches on his childish temper tantrums, his inability to let even the tiniest of slights go, and Sean Spicer s whining that the press hurts Trump s feelings:The media was there, too, and they were very sorry.  Donald,  the newscasters said,  we were mean to you. We used to laugh and call you names. We were no better than all of the other reindeer. How can you ever forgive us? Forgive you?  Donald Trump asked.  I ve already forgotten.  He smiled a big, beautiful smile.And she says,  Nothing that has ever happened or will ever happen was as great as Donald Trump s inauguration. Truth. Not. But Trump doesn t know that. In his mind, he can do no wrong. His accomplishments are great and many, his failures and faults don t exist, and the press is very, very wrong to not focus on his great accomplishments. He s a legend in his own mind.Trump, we should all remember, has the best speeches, the best words, the best everything, and Petri highlights his incessant, exaggerated bragging with this: Everyone liked Donald Trump s speech and the words that he used. They liked even more the part where he rolled up his sleeve and showed off his bicep. It was a great bicep. It made the Rock so upset to see it that he threw something down on the ground and said  darn. However, the true zingers start when Petri talks about how Trump walked through the crowd (he didn t), touching everyone  in a way that they all thought was welcome and appropriate,  (ha!) and curing diseases, kind of like Jesus, so nobody would ever need vaccines again. She then points out a piece of Trump s agenda in this gem of sarcasm: It was like the Oscars, but also like Woodstock, but also like the Super Bowl, but also like the Sermon on the Mount. If you were not there, you should just go home and die, because nothing in your life will have purpose or meaning by comparison, not even holding your newborn child in your arms or having health insurance.  [emphasis mine]And finally, she closes with the biggest zinger of all: Donald Trump is the star. People love him.He won the popular vote, too.  [emphasis mine]Considering he plans on wasting taxpayer dollars with an investigation to prove he won the popular vote, that s the best of all of them. Maybe Trump will notice this story, but not its sarcasm, and make an even bigger fool of himself on this.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",News,25-Jan-17
 Trump’s Stupid ‘Voter Fraud’ Witch Hunt Just ‘Busted’ One Of His Own Top Minions,"On Wednesday morning, Donald Trump announced that he would be launching a full-scale investigation into why so many women and minorities were allowed to vote for his opponent voter fraud, including  those registered to vote in two states.  Depending on the results of his investigation, President Asterisk says he plans to  strengthen  regulations to ensure that only white, straight men get to vote for the rest of time our elections are fair and only corrupt government officials and brutal foreign dictators have a say.I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017Now, Trump is completely wrong about it being a crime to be registered in two states. Voting in two states is a crime. But let s humor him. Let s say that is voter fraud. He really doesn t have to look far at all to find someone.Trump senior advisor Steve Bannon is a lot of things: he s an anti-semite, a white supremacist, a douchebag, and an alleged domestic abuser. He s also a proud registered voter in the state of New York   and in Florida.Bannon registered to vote in New York shortly before the election and cast his ballot for Trump in only that state. But he is also registered to vote at the home of a friend, Andy Badolato, in the Sunshine State. He changed his address in Florida in August, shortly after reports surfaced that he was previously registered at an abandoned house. Bannon did not commit voter fraud in any way, but according to Trump he is a criminal simply because he has an outdated registration in Florida.This must be uncomfortable for Trump, whose false claims about what does and does not constitute fraud has nailed one of his senior minions, but it s likely that he will ignore it because it doesn t quite fit his narrative that millions of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton, and that is why he lost the popular vote.Did you ever think you would see the President abuse the powers of his office to satisfy his ego and push a debunked conspiracy theory? Yeah, we didn t either, but here we are.Featured image via Getty Images/Mark Wilson",News,25-Jan-17
 REPORT: Trump Will Likely Force US Taxpayers To Pay Mexican Companies To Build His Border Wall,"Adding insult to injury, not only will Donald Trump force U.S. taxpayers to build the wall along the southern border, he will use that money to hire Mexican companies to build it.During his inaugural address, Trump claimed America would follow tow rules.We will follow two simple rules: BUY AMERICAN & HIRE AMERICAN!#InaugurationDay #MAGA??  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 20, 2017That s right. The man who buys materials for his hotels from overseas and has his products made by overseas laborers literally commanded Americans to buy American made goods and to hire American workers.And Trump is already breaking those rules as president.Trump repeatedly promised his supporters that he would build a wall alongside the entirety of the U.S.-Mexican border and force Mexico to pay for it. Trump then said that American taxpayers would pay for it and Mexico will simply reimburse us for the cost. Just before taking office, Trump went to Congress to ask them for the money to build the wall.Yesterday, Trump declared once again on Twitter that he is following through with building the wall.Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017But now it appears that Trump is getting ready to screw over American taxpayers, American workers, and American companies because he intends to hire Mexican companies to build the wall.According to The Guardian,The construction consultants Gleeds Worldwide said building a 1,000-mile wall   the border is 1,889 miles long but large parts are protected by natural barriers including mountains and the Rio Grande   would cost $31bn and take 40,000 people more than five years to construct.And because Mexican laborers and Mexican companies are less expensive, Trump will likely pay them to build it, thus depriving American workers and companies from benefiting. The idea of building a 1,000-mile wall which is designed to be impenetrable is something that may well come back to haunt the president,  Gleeds chairman Richard Steer said.  You ve got to build roads to move the materials and machinery and get the workforce to the location as the wall is being built. You would need a very big labor force to build it   some 40,000 people working over five years. Steer went on to state that Mexican workers would benefit the most from the massive project because they are closer to the site and make less pay.Mexican companies are also poised to benefit most from the project because materials are cheaper.Analysts at Bernstein investment bank plotted the location of nearby plants and quarries and found that the Mexican building company Cemex was best-positioned to provide materials on both sides of the border.In short, Trump is going to do the same thing he did in order to build his hotels. He s going to screw over American companies and American workers by using foreign labor and buying materials from foreign companies to do the job. And the taxpayers are going to fund every last wasteful dime of the cost and get nothing in return except a useless ugly wall that will do nothing to stop immigration and will draw comparisons to walls built by other tyrannical regimes such as the Berlin Wall built by the Soviet Union.It s time for Trump supporters to wake up and realize that Trump doesn t give a damn about them at all.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,25-Jan-17
 CNN Smacks Trump With Inauguration Day Ratings Facts After He Praises Fox News,"Donald Trump just got humiliated by CNN with facts after he attacked the network on Twitter.Trump once again referred to CNN as  fake news  while praising Fox News for having higher ratings during the inauguration ceremony.Congratulations to @FoxNews for being number one in inauguration ratings. They were many times higher than FAKE NEWS @CNN   public is smart!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017It s absolutely petty, not to mention totally biased, for a president to promote one news organization over another. It s especially embarrassing for a president to attack the free press like Trump has been doing.But CNN fired back on Twitter soon after Trump s post, informing him that CNN and Fox actually tied in total viewership for the day and CNN had an additional 16.9 million on digital platform. According to Neilson s cumulative numbers, 34 million people watched CNN s inauguration day coverage on television. 34 million watched Fox News. There were an additional 16.9 million live video starts on CNN digital platforms. Those are the facts. @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/bTtBoNr0Bn  CNN Communications (@CNNPR) January 25, 2017So while people tuned into Fox for the ceremony itself, most people tuned in to watch CNN s commentary and analysis as the day continued. In other words, while people were willing to watch Fox to catch the inauguration, they did not want to watch Fox News  biased propaganda afterward and chose to watch CNN instead.Donald Trump has been targeting CNN for awhile now. He repeatedly attacked them on the campaign trail and now he is still attacking them now, even going so far as to call them  fake news  during a press conference earlier this month. If President Obama has called Fox  fake news  during a press conference conservatives would have screamed bloody murder and accused Obama of attacking the free press.But as usual, conservatives are hypocrites because they don t seem to have any problem with Trump attacking the free press as long as he only attacks the real free press.Featured image via Steve Pope/Getty Images",News,25-Jan-17
 Trump Is HOPING People Won’t See This Video That PROVES He’s Lying About Voter Fraud,"CNN talked to the man who conducted the study Donald Trump cited as  proof  that 3 million people voted illegally in the 2016 Election and Trump will not like what he said.During an interview with Wolf Blitzer, political science professor Brian Schaffner absolutely shattered Trump s claim that he only lost the popular vote because over 3 million people voted illegally.Trump s claim has been debunked multiple times and even many Republicans are embarrassed by it enough that they are begging him to stop repeating such a blatant lie.Blitzer asked Schaffner about the data his team collected in a 2014 study which found that  14 percent of non-citizens said they were eligible to vote. Schaffner has since called the study unreliable because his team went back to talk to the participants and found that none of them actually voted. As it turns out, they merely clicked the wrong button when answering the question.SCHAFFNER: Well, what the authors did was essentially use a question on our survey that asked people whether or not they were a citizen. What we did was actually go back and ask those people again whether or not they were a citizen, and a lot of people had just basically erroneously clicked on the wrong button, and the people who we could actually confirm were actually noncitizens, they were basically no voters among that group.BLITZER: Either   so, what you re saying, that no non-citizens voted as far as your study, your data was concerned, in those elections?SCHAFFNER: That s right. We could find   of the people who we were sure were noncitizens, we could not find any who had actually cast a vote.So Trump is literally citing an unreliable study as evidence of his claims, something that Schaffner finds absolutely  frustrating. It s very frustrating,  Schaffner said. The data certainly do not show that. We published a study basically showing that the study that the data   that uses our data to say that, is wrong. That study has been widely cited by news outlets to basically say what the administration is saying is false.And the notion that millions of people could vote illegally and no one would have any data to be able to show this is the case is just absurd. It s absurd that millions of people, millions of noncitizens, would have voted in 2016. It s just   it s just not even plausible. Schaffner went on to concede that a handful of non-citizens may have voted in the election, but the scale of voter fraud Donald Trump is talking about is impossible.Here s the video via Media Matters.Indeed, Trump claimed that massive voter fraud was being committed during the campaign, only to be refuted by Ohio s Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted. Our institutions, like our election system, is one of the bedrocks of American democracy,  Husted said in October.  We should not question it or the legitimacy of it. It works very well. The idea of widespread voter fraud would require some systemic problem in our system, and so if there s a systemic problem, please identify it. Don t just make an allegation on Twitter. Tell me, tell the secretaries of state around the country what the problem is so that we can fix it. But right now we re not aware of any systemic problems in our voting system. Are there cases of voter fraud? Absolutely, there are cases of voter fraud. But it s rare, and we catch these people. Most times we catch them before their vote is even counted. And that goes for every state across the nation. Trump should be embarrassed and ashamed. And if he really thinks our election was rigged then we should hold a brand new election immediately and give him something to really cry about when the American people reject him.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,25-Jan-17
 The Numbers Are In: Trump Is The Most Hated Newly Inaugurated President EVER,"It s been less than a week since Donald Trump took the oath of office, and already he s breaking records left and right (and none of them are good).Simply put: Donald Trump is the most hated incoming president this country has seen in at least 60 years.According to Gallup Polling:President Donald Trump is the first elected president in Gallup s polling history to receive an initial job approval rating below the majority level. He starts his term in office with 45% of Americans approving of the way he is handling his new job, 45% disapproving and 10% yet to form an opinion. Trump now holds the record for the lowest initial job approval rating as well as the highest initial disapproval rating in Gallup surveys dating back to Dwight D. Eisenhower.Congratulations, America. You nominated a man you vehemently hate (more so than George W. Bush).To put it in perspective, let s look at the numbers for Trump and past presidents:Donald Trump  Approve: 45 percent. Disapprove: 45 percentBarack Obama  Approve: 68 percent. Disapprove: 12 percentGeorge W. Bush  Approve: 57 percent. Disapprove: 25 percentBill Clinton  Approve: 58 percent. Disapprove: 20 percentGeorge H.W. Bush  Approve: 51 percent. Disapprove: 6 percentRonald Reagan: Approve: 51 percent. Disapprove: 13 percentJimmy Carter  Approve: 68 percent. Disapprove: 8 percentRichard Nixon  Approve: 59 percent. Disapprove: 5 percentJohn F Kennedy  Approve: 72 percent. Disapprove: 6 percentDwight D. Eisenhower  Approve: 68 percent. Disapprove: 7 percentOuch. If Trump can t even beat out Richard Nixon and George W. Bush (who won a contentious and blistering recount), that says something.Of course Trump s biggest base of support   men, whites and no college education   loved him while all the others   women, people of color and the educated   despise him. Ninety percent of Republicans give him approval while 81 percent of Democrats disapprove. Independents have a slightly more negative view than they do positive (44-40 percent).Knowing that his pre-inaugural numbers and the turnout for the Women s March sent him into a frenzy, these numbers should only exasperate the new authoritarian-in-chief.Featured image via Getty Images",News,25-Jan-17
 Protest Group Puts GIANT Sign On Crane Next To White House; Trump’s Gonna Lose His Mind (IMAGE),"If there s one thing Donald Trump doesn t like, it s not being liked or loved. He seems to want people to only say nice things to him or about him, and only do things that are favorable to him.The moment anyone dare criticize Trump, or write a bit of negative press about him, he flips out, becomes unhinged, and will go on a rant about how horrible those who dare criticize him are. Usually via his medium of choice   Twitter.Well, one group doesn t really seem to give a flying f*ck about what Trump thinks of them and are giving him the ultimate middle finger by placing a protest sign on a crane pretty much next to the White House, and definitely visible from the White House.That group? Greenpeace.Here s the protest sign of the rallying cry  resist  that many protesters are using:So @Greenpeace is hanging this banner from a crane that's visible from the White House pic.twitter.com/3lRgjnKes5  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) January 25, 2017Here s a better view:via TwitterAnd here s a close-up:via TwitterGreenpeace is sending Trump a message that they will not be bullied into submission, and the fact of the matter is, there are many, many people who do not like him whatsoever.Be prepared for a Twitter hissy fit soon about this very sign.Featured image via Twitter",News,25-Jan-17
 Trump Targets Clean Water And Clean Air Regulations At Environmental Protection Agency,"It s official. Donald Trump is literally trying to murder the American people.As humans, we need clean air and clean water to survive as a species. Without them, we would suffocate or die of thirst. Crops and livestock also require clean water and clean air to produce our food supply.This is basic stuff, but Donald Trump doesn t care about the needs of human beings. He only cares about corporate greed and that greed is going to kill millions.Trump has already launched an all-out assault on the Environmental Protection Agency, which works every day fighting for clean water and clean air for the American people.The agency has been ordered to freeze grants and contracts which has halted air and water quality tests.But now Trump is looking to chip away at the bedrock of what the EPA exists to do.According to Vox,Jonathan Swan of Axios got a look at an  agency action  plan that Trump s advisers have written up for the EPA. Among the initiatives they plan to target:  Clean Air Act greenhouse gas regulations for new (NSPS) and existing (ESPS or the  Clean Power  Plan) coal and natural gas power plants   [CAFE] Standards   Clean Water Section 404: Waters of the U.S. Rule (wetlands)   TMDL (Total Maximum Daily Load) for Chesapeake Bay. By attacking the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, Trump would be sentencing America to a deadly polluted future the likes of which have not been seen since the EPA was created.Americans look at Beijing in horror as China allows the air in that city to be so thick and poisonous that people need to wear gas masks every day if they go outside.Here s an image of New York in 1973 before the EPA aggressively fought for air standards via the National Archives.And here s one of Los Angeles.If Trump has his way, American cities will once again be choked by smog and our air quality with significantly decrease. One wonders if Trump has investments in gas mask companies.Fresh water has also been a worry among millions of Americans over the years as Republicans continue to make decisions that allow companies like Koch Industries to pollute our waterways. Trump s executive order to let the Keystone XL pipeline move forward is a direct threat to the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides water to millions of Americans in the Midwest and is responsible for creating what is now called  America s Breadbasket. The Washington Post reports,In some places the aquifer is buried 1,200 feet deep, but in many places it is at or very close to the surface, often less than five feet below ground That s where concerns about the Keystone XL came in. Its original route traversed 92 miles of the Sand Hills and the Ogallala. TransCanada, which said it would bury the pipeline at least four feet underground, could in many places be putting it in water TransCanada submitted a revised route to the State Department, bypassing the Sand Hills but still passing over some parts of the aquifer.Should a massive oil spill occur, it could seep into the aquifer and poison it. And that would be a disaster even bigger than the lead poisoned water in Flint, Michigan because it would literally affect every American across the country.And these spills can contaminate water for decades. The reason why Flint s water supply was tainted with lead is because Republicans decided to save money by switching the city s water from Lake Huron to the Flint River, which was contaminated by lead decades ago, which is why Flint got it s water from Lake Huron. This is public knowledge, but Republicans ignored that and switched anyway.Trump also wants to expedite oil and gas permits and open up pristine natural lands to fracking and mining, which threatens habitats and our water supply. As we should all know, fracking has already poisoned water supplies in places around the country. Some people can even light their water on fire because of the chemicals fracking companies use. That will increase under Trump.Republicans now control Congress, so they will likely help Trump weaken the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts no matter how much the American people protest.So by letting Trump and the Republicans remain in office we are letting them kill us. Literally.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,25-Jan-17
 Scientists Planning A March On Washington To Protest Trump,"Now that the Women s March successfully outnumbered President Trump s pathetic inauguration (which humiliated and enraged him), there s a new group planning a march in the nation s capital: scientists.For years scientists have become the brunt of the GOP s rage over facts and environmentalism. Their echos of  Well, I m not a scientist  was always safeguarded by the intelligence and compassion of President Obama and his commitment to tackling the threat of climate change.Well now those are the days of that past, and we have a president who believes climate change is a  hoax  made up by the Chinese to make competition harder for the United States.And as such, it should come as no surprise that the new Administration is taking authoritarian measures to clamp down on scientists  ability to combat climate change. From blackouts to gag-orders, agencies responsible for scientific research (Agriculture, EPA, Park Services) have seen their life s work sullied by a petulant man-baby and his band of  alternate facts  promoting hooligans.Well, like the women of America, they aren t going to take it.Starting from the poplar sharing website Reddit, two scientists called for a March on Washington similar to the Women s March. In just two days, a Facebook page sprang up, accumulating over 88,000  likes  (and still growing rapidly).Dubbed the  March for Science,  the group hopes to have a protest in D.C. as well as  sister cities  Seattle and Boston, which have currently have plans in the works. A date will be announced in about a week, according to the group.In an email to the Washington Post, one of the chairs of the Facebook group, science writer and public health researcher Caroline Weinberg, wrote:We were inspired (well, infuriated) by the current attacks on science from the new administration. Slashing funding and restricting scientists from communicating their findings (from tax-funded research!) with the public is absurd and cannot be allowed to stand as policy.With a pledge to be welcoming to all (with special emphasis on the minority community), the visionaries for the march have one simple message:  Anyone who believes in empirical science can participate. That s it. That s the only requirement. An inclusive, fact based uprising of intellectuals of all stripes and backgrounds, here to promote the safety and survival of the planet. Now that s what America is all about.Featured image via Flickr",News,25-Jan-17
 Secret Service Agent Risks Everything To Denounce Trump: ‘I Ain’t Taking A Bullet For Him’ (SCREENSHOTS),"Would you die to save the President? What if it was President Trump? A longtime secret service agent recently risked time in prison to promise the world that if she is all that stands between Trump and a bullet, the bullet wins.Kerry O Grady, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service s Denver district, didn t mention Trump directly in her Facebook post, but she didn t have to. Her words make it clear whom she means: As a public servant for nearly 23 years, I struggle to not violate the Hatch Act. So I keep quiet and skirt the median. To do otherwise can be a criminal offense for those in my position. Despite the fact that I am expected to take a bullet for both sides. But this world has changed and I have changed. And I would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what I believe to be disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here. Hatch Act be damned. I am with Her. The Hatch Act prohibits executive branch members aside from the President, Vice President, and other selected people, from making partisan statements. The Hatch Act is designed both to protect employees from being forced to support a particular candidate, but it also acts to limit the political activities of executive branch employees.After several days, O Grady removed the post. It was an internal struggle for me but as soon as I put it up, I thought it was not the sentiment that I needed to share because I care very deeply about the mission,  she said. However, she has not stopped posting her thoughts on social media. She also changed her cover photo to images of the Women s March in Denver, writing all of these women represent me! Proud to say it! #nasty  and uploaded a photo of Princess Leia, captioned A woman s place is in the resistance. My government is the most important thing to me,  she says.  I serve at the pleasure of the president, but I still have the First Amendment right to say things. The Secret Service refuses to discuss the situation, but that the posts will be  seriously and swiftly investigated. While some may criticize her for her posts, she probably made the right decision. After all, he is already threatening to march on American cities, isn t he?featured image via screengrab",News,25-Jan-17
 Trump Plans To Issue Executive Order Allowing CIA To Use Torture,"Torture is illegal in this country and the United States is bound by the United Nations and the Geneva Convention to not commit such a war crime.But Donald Trump intends to sign an executive order that would open the door for the CIA to use torture on detainees and reopen secret  black sites  that are used to make people disappear.According to the New York Times, the  sweeping executive order would clear the way for the Central Intelligence Agency to reopen overseas  black site  prisons, like those where it detained and tortured terrorism suspects before former President Obama shut them down. Republicans have been defending the use of torture since it was revealed that former President George W. Bush authorized waterboarding during his presidency. It s a form of torture that simulates drowning. Even Senator John McCain says that waterboarding is torture. He would know. He was tortured in Vietnam while Trump dodged the draft and spent his days womanizing and spending his daddy s money.Most tellingly, conservatives who say waterboarding isn t torture, like Trump propagandist Sean Hannity, cowardly refuse to be waterboarded themselves even though they claim it s not torture.The only thing standing in Trump s way is a 2015 law that Republicans can easily repeal now that banned American officials from torturing detainees.Of course, it really doesn t matter what the law is since Trump will likely ignore it anyway like he ignores everything else such as facts and reality.The United States Constitution expressly forbids the use of cruel and and unusual punishment. Furthermore, torture does not work as an information gathering technique because the victim will say anything to make the torture stop. So if the CIA tortures an innocent person, they would get false information no matter what they do. And such bad information is a threat to the lives of our soldiers in the field and can lead to disastrous decisions by government. This country should not be making decisions based on what a torture victim is telling their torturer.Using torture also opens the door for other nations to use torture against us and we would be no better than the nations that currently do use it.Donald Trump is not making America great. He s an embarrassment who is only weakening this country every single day he is allowed to continue being president. Our power and reputation in the world is becoming a joke that nations like Russia and China are laughing at because our loss is their gain. America is not only losing international prestige and respect, we are being destroyed from within as Trump continues to take a jackhammer to the foundation of this country, which will destroy lives both inside and outside our nation.Resistance to Donald Trump s regime is no longer enough. If we want to save America s soul it will take something more. Because waiting for four years will be too late.Featured image via Wong/Getty Images",News,25-Jan-17
 Trump Takes His Voter Fraud Conspiracy To A TERRIFYING New Level,"Donald Trump has been obsessed with the fact that he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton ever since the election results came in. Not satisfied with the Electoral College victory that handed him the White House, Trump has continued to double and triple down on an insane and unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that massive voter fraud is what cost him the popular vote.Well now, with the power of the presidency behind him, Trump has taken a terrifying step: Saying he will open a  major investigation  into the 2016 election. He also seems to be laying the groundwork for even more voter suppression and disenfranchisement of voters who are least likely to vote for him. He tweeted early Wednesday morning of his plans:I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017What makes this even more disturbing is that Trump s Attorney General pick, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, has a long and storied history of opposing civil rights, and specifically voting rights. This is just a way for Republicans to sow discord and deny facts, and to help assuage Trump s ego by allowing him to make himself feel better in this new world of  alternative facts,  that White House counsel Kellyanne Conway infamously pushed on Sunday.This is dangerous beyond anything we ever could have imagined. We have a conspiracy theorist as president, who also happens to be a narcissistic madman who cannot accept the truth. Even worse, he has people around him who are defending his antics, and who are perfectly willing to lie to the American people about the most trivial of matters. If they ll lie about this, what else will they lie about?This administration is a threat to our democracy. Regardless of political ideology, it has to be concluded that Trump is undermining the fabric of our republic before our very eyes.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,25-Jan-17
 National Park Service Officials HILARIOUSLY Troll Trump Over Silencing Government Agencies (TWEETS),"Trump may be working to silence government agencies like the Department of the Interior, home to the National Park Service, as well as the EPA and the USDA s science and research office, but some government employees are not having it. Operating anonymously, a group of rangers from the National Park Service, with the help of some friends, are running a Twitter account that s going after Trump s efforts to muzzle science.The name on the account is AltUSNatParkService. They ve been around since 2015, but only became well known over the last day or so as Trump worked to remove scientific information from the White House website, and seems to be ordering any agency or department that publishes climate science to shut it.In addition to posting photos from our beautiful national parks, these rangers have also launched a very obvious offensive effort against Herr Trump by being a veritable fount of climate science.These are people who will not be silenced.These are people who will not allow their colleagues to be silenced either.And besides the climate science they re tweeting, they re also taking very pointed digs at Trump.

US national parks posted tweets about climate change that were later deleted.

AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017President Trump has called climate change a hoax & the White House deleted the climate change policies on its website on inauguration day.  AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017A media blackout has also been introduced over our colleagues at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017Fun fact: The White House is surrounded by NPS land, and during Occupy they supported the protesters despite the mayor s objection.  AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017Can t wait for President Trump to call us FAKE NEWS.You can take our official twitter, but you ll never take our free time!  AltUSNatParkService (@AltNatParkSer) January 25, 2017They re also actively supporting a Scientists March on Washington to show this administration that science will not go down without a fight any more than women, people of color, LGBTQ people and anyone else marginalized will.Perhaps the sudden popularity of this account will give employees of other muzzled agencies some ideas for how to keep their information flowing. In the age of social media, it s far more difficult to silence people. Trump is going to have some serious problems here.Featured image by Workman, CC-BY-3.0 via Wikipedia",News,25-Jan-17
 Trump Just Praised Fox News’ Ratings And Attacked CNN Again Then Got CRUSHED By Twitter (TWEETS),"If you haven t yet heard that Fox News came out on top in ratings during Donald Trump s inauguration, all you need to do is check President Asterisk s Twitter timeline. After a rousing first few days of working toward dismantling Obamacare, endangering the health of women and girls worldwide, and signing our environment away for a few short-term construction jobs, The Donald hopped on Twitter to get right back to what appears to be his real job: attacking news agencies that report unflattering details about him. Congratulations to @FoxNews for being number one in inauguration ratings,  Trump tweeted.  They were many times higher than FAKE NEWS @CNN   public is smart! Congratulations to @FoxNews for being number one in inauguration ratings. They were many times higher than FAKE NEWS @CNN   public is smart!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017Neilson estimates that 30.6 million people tuned in to watch the trainwreck that was Trump s sparsely-attended inauguration   millions fewer than Barack Obama s first swearing-in (maybe that s why he just threatened to send  the feds  to march on Chicago). Trump is correct that more people watched Fox News than any other individual news station, but he is also correct that the public is smart. What he fails to realize is that the majority of the  smart  public didn t watch Fox.Mediaite reported Monday that during the peak coverage block of 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST, Fox News drew 8.77 million viewers. This may seem like a lot, but NBC brought in 5.90 million people, ABC attracted 4.90 million, CBS had about 4.65 million viewers, 2.61 million watched CNN, and 1.38 million tuned in to MSNBC. In other words, the smart people watched different networks than the vapid, meth-addled freaks who enjoyed Trump s victory with the whitest news team on television.Naturally, the Internet wasn t about to tolerate the President* attacking legitimate news agencies:@realDonaldTrump This is beyond sad.

 Trump’s Labor Pick Belonged To Group That FORCES Workers To Listen To Right-Wing Lies At Work,"Andrew Puzder, Trump s nominee for Secretary of Labor, hasn t had his confirmation hearing yet, but he ll probably end up getting confirmed despite opposition from pro-worker Democrats and labor groups. That s unfortunate, because he was once a part of a group with a ridiculous name: The Job Creators Network. This group is anything but pro-job creation, as they push all sorts of right-wing, anti-worker propaganda that s been shown to harm the economy and jobs.According to a report in The Nation, JCN pushes employers to pepper their employees with anti-government, pro-big business ideology, and while they don t specifically have their employers hold guns to their workers  heads to force them to pay attention to this stuff, they encourage employers to send out  government policy  emails, stuff paycheck envelopes with flyers, run their videos during team-building meetings and other company exercises, and post notices and infographics around the workplace, where they can easily see it and read it.In other words, this group that Puzder belonged to until just recently works to ensure employees don t have much of a choice but to pay attention to at least some of their stuff.And their stuff is insidious. For instance, their website, informationstation.org, has a film that ominously depicts cartoon workers disappearing into thin air and getting replaced with robots. It talks about how minimum wage hikes in California and New York could kill 700,000 jobs and 500,000 jobs, respectively. It also says that 16.8 million jobs could disappear if we raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour.What it doesn t say is that the 16.8 million number is the uppermost number in a range derived by the right-wing American Action Forum, and that the low end is 3.3 million.It certainly doesn t mention anything whatsoever about higher minimum wages having a positive effect on jobs, like what the CEO of Wetzel s Pretzels noticed in California after their minimum wage went up.Watch the spin below:JCN also paints minimum wage earners as less-than deserving of a living wage. An infographic neatly informs workers that over half of minimum wage earners are ages 16-24, that 64 percent of them are part-time workers, that 65.2 percent have never been married, and 27.9 percent have not graduated high school. These statistics are true, but they re using them in very deceptive ways to push an anti-minimum wage message.And that message is quite clear: Minimum wage earners don t deserve a living wage, and since all raising it will do is destroy your job, you should vote for people who don t want to raise the minimum wage.They paint the new overtime rule as a job killer, too. And on and on it goes   all of this is stuff that employees at many companies are forced to watch or read. According to The Nation s report, this propaganda effort has actually effected dramatic changes in the way workers see these issues, which, in turn, affects how they vote.This bullshit is why we have such terrible income inequality. JCN is selling the very myths that have created such a problem with income inequality and stagnant wages, and harms the workers they claim they want to protect. If any of this was going to actually work, it would have worked by now. It s had over 30 years to work.And Puzder belonged to this group until at least December, although JCN claims he never belonged. We re about to have a Secretary of Labor who isn t just in favor of these policies, but appears to have supported forcing workers to view propaganda, and outright lies, for the purpose of brainwashing them so the so-called  job creators  can continue to fatten their wallets, and for the purpose of getting them to vote Republican.Featured image by Jason Kempin via Getty Images for Dream Foundation",News,25-Jan-17
 Trump Just Threatened To ‘Send In The Feds’ To March On Obama’s Hometown (TWEETS),"Holy f*ckballs, it hasn t even been a week since President Asterisk was inaugurated and he s already talking about martial law. Trump s presidency is off to a great start for people who like to sit back and watch the world burn (special shout-out to Jill Stein voters). Trump has taken the first step via executive orders to dismantling Obamacare, begun destroying our environment with two massive pipeline projects, and financially crippled any international health organization that so much as mentions abortion, and all of that is pretty f*cking scary, but a tweet he sent out Tuesday night is downright horrifying.

Darren Goble (@DarrensThinking) January 25, 2017@realDonaldTrump Hitler did the same when the Reichtstag building burned in 1933. Martial Law was declared & the rest is history. @maddow https://t.co/WpPvDprekK  markevans (@markevans08) January 25, 2017As it turns out,  the feds  (in this case, the Justice Department) have already been there and have diagnosed the problem with violence in Chicago: police brutality and racism, but Trump and his Republican compatriots typically dismiss such well-research opinions in favor of licking the badges of cops who make the rest look bad.What will happen when Trump  sends in the feds?  Well, we don t need to look past what Hitler did after the Reichstag fire:Using emergency constitutional powers, Adolf Hitler s cabinet had issued a Decree for the Protection of the German People on February 4, 1933. This decree placed constraints on the press and authorized the police to ban political meetings and marches, effectively hindering electoral campaigning. A temporary measure, it was followed by a more dramatic and permanent suspension of civil rights following the February 27 burning of the parliament building.Though the origins of the fire are still unclear, in a propaganda maneuver, the coalition government (Nazis and the German Nationalist People s Party) blamed the Communists. They exploited the Reichstag fire to secure President von Hindenburg s approval for an emergency decree, the Decree for the Protection of the People and the State of February 28. Popularly known as the Reichstag Fire Decree, the regulations suspended the right to assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and other constitutional protections, including all restraints on police investigations.Justified on the false premise that the Communists were planning an uprising to overthrow the state, the Reichstag Fire Decree permitted the regime to arrest and incarcerate political opponents without specific charge, dissolve political organizations, and to suppress publications. It also gave the central government the authority to overrule state and local laws and overthrow state and local governments.Donald Trump is moving quickly, and we can no longer ignore the threat he poses. Write your legislators right now   seriously, do it right now   and demand that someone (anyone) begin organizing his impeachment immediately. The longer we wait, the more we lose.Featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla)/screengrab",News,24-Jan-17
 MSNBC Just Fact Checked Trump’s Voter Fraud Lies In Real Time And It Was GLORIOUS (VIDEO),"Although most of America did not want Donald Trump to be the country s next President, many of us were holding on to hope that we might see an improved version of what we witnessed during the former reality TV star s presidential campaign. Unfortunately, Trump and his team are proving to be worse than we thought, and they re only churning out more fear mongering and lies during his first week in office.New White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has continuously been backing up Trump s voter fraud claims since starting his new position. Trump has been trying to convince America that millions of illegal immigrants voted in the 2016 election, and Spicer has doubled down on those comments recently. Fortunately, the media has been on top of it, obviously frustrated at the lack of transparency from the new President. As Spicer lied his ass off on national television, MSNBC s Katy Tur fact-checked him in real time, and it was pretty amazing. Despite having zero actual evidence that voter fraud occurred, Spicer said: I think there s been studies that came from Pew in 2008 that showed fourteen percent of people who voted were not citizens. There are other studies that have been presented to him. It s a belief he maintains The President does believe that, I think he s stated that before, and stated his concern of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence people have brought to him. Here s what Tur said as she fact-checked Spicer on air: We want to do a little bit of fact checking on that statement because the White House now is referring to the same research that the campaign had referred to, and the transition had referred to. One was a Washington Post commissioned study which the Washington Post itself debunked, and the other one was a Pew study from 2012, which is actually from 2008, which said that approximately 24 million   one in every eight people are on voter registrations in the United States that no longer valid   and they are significantly inaccurate. Listing people who had died in the past, obviously, on the voter rolls. It doesn t mention anything about undocumented immigrants, so their basis of evidence isn t quite correct at all. You can watch that brilliant moment below:Here s @KatyTurNBC with an instant fact-check after Spicer said Trump believes millions voted illegally  based on studies and evidence  pic.twitter.com/Eb10dxtmqd  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) January 24, 2017MSNBC is far from the only network to prove Trump wrong. CNN, the media outlet that Trump has dubbed  fake news,  ran a headline that said, Trump believes millions voted illegally, WH says   but provides no proof .Hopefully, we re going to see more real-time fact checking from the media, because Trump and his team are the most dishonest administration we ve ever seen.Featured image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images",News,24-Jan-17
" Trump Tries To Stick It To Press With Inaugural Photo, TOTALLY Misses One YUGE Problem (IMAGES)","As of Tuesday morning, it seemed that Trump was still obsessed with the size of his inaugural audience. He s so intent on proving that his crowds were enormous big enough to serve as evidence of his total, utter and complete awesomeness that he s planning to post a panoramic photo of the inauguration in the press halls of the White House, and he tweeted it out with a thank-you to the photographer.Ordinarily, that would just be another facepalm-worthy tweet. However, given his fixation on crowd sizes (penis sizes? Maybe both), we can probably safely assume that he s putting these photos in the press halls as a giant  told you so  to the press that so shamefully refused to report the truth about his crowds. Based on that, one would also assume he d want the photo to be as accurate as possible, so as to avoid any potential embarrassment.It didn t work. Here s the photo:Image via TwitterAnd here s the problem: The caption reads  January 21, 2017,  which is the date of the Women s Marches that so enraged him over the weekend:Image via TwitterAs Ms. Kalb points out, he s posting an error in the press halls. Way to stick it to them, Cheetolini.This follows not just the poorly-thought out presser on Saturday, where Sean Spicer scolded the entire White House press corps and left them with their jaws on the floor, but it also follows yesterday s press briefing where Spicer whined that the press isn t focusing enough on Trump s successes and achievements (he s been in office for five days, what successes does he think the press should be reporting on right now?).The man is ridiculous. There are more important things to think about. Trump, however, is obsessed, and the reason it s important to keep pointing this out is because it s evidence of his instability, his willingness to turn lies into truth, and his inability to actually be a real leader.Featured image via Twitter",News,24-Jan-17
 The Netherlands Just TROLLED Trump In His Own Words And It’s Hilariously BRILLIANT (VIDEO),"While Donald Trump likes to go around saying he s only going to put America first, the rest of the world has its own opinion about that.One of the nations speaking out against Trump just absolutely and hilariously satirized him using his own words   or rather, words he s notoriously been known to use with his figures of speech. That nation is The Netherlands.The satire show Zondag Met Lubach, much like our own The Daily Show, put together a fake tourism commercial using a voice that sounded just like Trump s, and using language that he would use, including some policy proposals.Needless to say, they re not huge fans of Trump whatsoever.Dutch comedian Arjen Lubach says, as he introduces the pretend advertisement: He had a clear message to the rest of the world:  I will screw you over big time.  Well okay, he used slightly different words:  From this day forward. It s going to be only America first .And we realize it s better for us to get along [so] we decided to introduce our tiny country to him in a way that will probably appeal to him the most. From there, it was absolutely comic genius.Watch the hilarious video here:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,24-Jan-17
" Trump Just Signed Away Our Environment, And Americans Are Sick Of His Bullsh*t (TWEETS)","Donald Trump betrayed Americans on Tuesday by proving to be exactly as large an environmental threat as was predicted. Trump gloated on Twitter that he was signing authorizations to move forward both with the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Signing orders to move forward with the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines in the Oval Office,  Trump tweeted Tuesday afternoon. The Washington Post reports:Dealing a blow to former President Barack Obama s legacy on climate change, President Donald Trump signed executive actions Tuesday to advance the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, a move cheered by congressional Republicans and decried by environmentalists.Trump told reporters at the White House that the actions on the pipelines will be subject to the terms and conditions being negotiated by U.S. officials.Not everyone is happy about Trump s new order.  Americans know this pipeline was unfairly rerouted towards our nation and without our consent. The existing pipeline route risks infringing on our treaty rights, contaminating our water and the water of 17 million Americans downstream,  said Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock tribe with whom thousands upon thousands of protesters have joined in opposition to a plan to route the Dakota pipeline under a lake near the tribe s reservation. Such a move, anyone with critical thinking skills realizes, would threaten the area s water supply and sacred Native American sites.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers agreed late last year to begin an environmental assessment and consider alternative routes, but it is unclear what will happen now that Trump has given his go-ahead. It seems the whole of Twitter also disagrees with the move.

" Democrat Forces Trump’s Own Nominee To MOCK Him, Admit Obama’s Inauguration Was Bigger (VIDEO)","Donald Trump is fuming over the size of his little inauguration last weekend. Not only did his inauguration have embarrassingly low attendance numbers when compared to Barack Obama s previous inaugurations, but it was also completely outnumbered by the Women s March, which was a protest AGAINST him!Trump has tried to make his inauguration look less pathetic by having his team spew lies, despite the fact that photographic evidence clearly shows that almost no one went to see him get sworn in as the 45th President of the United States. While Trump continues to soothe his monstrous ego on Twitter, his political opponents are having the time of their lives mocking him   and what Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley just did was the perfect way to troll someone like Trump.At the confirmation hearing for Rep. Mike Mulvaney (R-SC), Trump s pick for director of the Office of Management and Budget, Merkley forced Mulvaney to humiliate Trump in front of everyone by showing side by side photos of Trump s inauguration and Obama s 2009 inauguration. To make things even worse, Merkley asked Mulvaney to publicly state which inauguration crowd was bigger.Faced with the evidence and a room full of peers, Mulvaney was forced to admit what Trump and his team wouldn t: that Obama s inauguration crowd was bigger. Merkley then tied it all together, making sure to state his point in mocking Trump. He said: The reason I m raising this is because budgets often contain varied deceptions. You and I talked in my office about the  magic asterisk.  This is an example of something where the president s team, on something very simple and straightforward, wants to embrace a fantasy rather than a reality. You can watch this beautiful moment below:Later, Merkley made sure Mulvaney got the point by calling on him to give actual budgets instead of the  alternative facts  Trump s team has become well known for.This was absolutely brilliant, and we need more senators calling Trump and his team out for their lies. They need to be held accountable, and this was a great way to do it.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,24-Jan-17
" Just Days In, Trump Administration Ready To Dump Top Staffer","Brand new White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer is off to a rough start. In just a few days, the media has been relentless for calling him out on his never-ending stream of lies, or, as Kellyanne Conway put it,  alternative facts. Publicly, everything seems peachy keen   after all, the boss has been known to fudge a truth or a few thousand. Privately, though, there s word that the Trump White House is already looking to replace its first scapegoat. Not, though, because of the lies. Trump s not a fan of Spicer s performance because of optics:Politico Playbook alum Mike Allen writes,  This West Wing is a tough neighborhood. Even AFTER Sean Spicer s successful get-back-on-the-horse presser yesterday, I m told that a top White House official was discussing his possible replacement. On Day 4! He continues, reporting that Trump himself is displeased with Spicer for reasons completely divorced from his argumentative skills.  Unfortunately for Spicer, Trump is obsessed with his press secretary s performance art. Our Jonathan Swan hears that Trump hasn t been impressed with how Spicer dresses, once asking an aide:  Doesn t the guy own a dark suit? Source: MediaiteTrump s problem with Spicer has nothing to do with the media s calling him out on his lies. If anything, for Trump, Spicer didn t lie enough, and he certainly didn t prop up his new Commander-in-Chief enough:Many critics thought Spicer went too far and compromised his integrity. But in Trump s mind, Spicer s attack on the news media was not forceful enough. The president was also bothered that the spokesman read, at times haltingly, from a printed statement.Trump has been resentful, even furious, at what he views as the media s failure to reflect the magnitude of his achievements, and he feels demoralized that the public s perception of his presidency so far does not necessarily align with his own sense of accomplishment.Source: Washington PostAs for Trump preferring a woman, don t take that as a sign that the glass ceiling will break during Trump s administration. Trump wants a spokesmodel who he can easily manipulate.While Spicer might get better at his job and at predicting his boss  wants, press secretaries don t have a lot of job stability. None have lost their jobs after less than a week though.Featured image by Shawn Thew via Getty Images ",News,24-Jan-17
 ‘No Real Logic’: French Translators Having A VERY Hard Time With Trump’s Limited Vocabulary,"Reality show star turned president Donald Trump has a limited vocabulary. French translators have noticed that, too, and say they are having a tough time translating Trump s speeches into the language of Moli re. Trump is not a great orator, which is something we ve all be subjected to. Words like,  sad!  are used in his tweets as if that s a complete sentence. Trump said  bigly  when he really meant  big league.  Or maybe he didn t mean  big league.  We ll never really know. After Trump gives a speech, his supporters inevitably jump in to explain to the rest of us what he really meant.Translator B reng re Viennot told the LA Review of Books, you have to be able to get into someone s mind  to translate the speaker but  when he (Trump) speaks he seems not to know quite where he s going. He seems to hang onto a word in the question, or to a word that pops into his mind, repeating it over and over again,  said Viennot.  He shapes his thought around it and, sometimes, succeeds in giving part of an answer   often the same answer: namely, that he won the election. Trump seems to go from point A (the question) to point B (himself, most of the time) with no real logic,  she continued.  It s as if he had thematic clouds in his head that he would pick from with no need of a logical thread to link them. Trump s vocabulary is limited, his syntax is broken; he repeats the same phrases over and over, forcing the translator to follow suit,  she said.She continued to say that  reading Trump in French, which is a very structured and logical language, reveals the poor quality of his language and, consequently, of his thought. As the Independent notes, Trump once referred to  swatches of land,  when he really he meant  swathes of land. Bigly swatches of land.Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images.",News,24-Jan-17
 FBI Clears Michael Flynn Of Wrongdoing As Trump Lets Comey Keep His Job,"On Tuesday, it was announced that Donald Trump has elected to keep James Comey (that nice gentleman who helped swing the election in Trump s favor by sending Republicans a letter falsely indicating that a new investigation into Hillary Clinton was being opened just before the election) as FBI Director. That s a move The New York Times notes will  keep Mr. Comey at the center of the F.B.I. s investigation into several Trump associates and their potential ties with the Russian government. Comey demonstrated with his attacks on Hillary that he has absolutely no integrity whatsoever, which makes him exactly the sort of guy Trump would want to keep around. Also on Tuesday, purely by coincidence of course, news broke that Trump s national security adviser was cleared of any wrongdoing in his frantic communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak on the same day President Obama announced sanctions against Russia for their cyberattack on our nation during the election.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who also says that Trump had the most heavily-witnessed inauguration in history, and for whom Kellyanne Conway created a new term,  alternative facts,  in an effort to normalize his lies, explained Monday that the two aren t in frequent contact but have spoken recently on a number of issues that were completely innocent, like logistics for a post-inauguration call between Trump and his Russian dictator friend who 17 intelligence agencies say directly interfered with our election on The Donald s behalf.The problem here is that Americans cannot be sure if the presented results are legitimate, as the FBI is headed by someone who went out of his way, breaking precedent and probably the law, to aid Trump in the election with misleading information about Clinton. This same man was just rewarded for his actions when Trump allowed him to keep his job. But Trump also has the power to fire him if he isn t satisfied with the results of any of the numerous investigations into his team.In November, Trump said that Comey  made a mistake  when he announced that Hillary Clinton had committed no crimes and would not be charged, but  brought back his reputation  when he released the letter that gave right-wing propaganda outlets (and Putin s team of propagandists) much-needed ammo just before the election.So now, we as Americans are presented with a dilemma: Do we accept the words of the FBI, knowing that Trump can fire the person in charge of the investigations, when he is someone who has shown a corrupt desire to interfere in important things like elections in the past? Or do we demand a full release of investigatory documents and transcripts just to be sure the truth is being told?Probably better to be safe about this.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images ",News,24-Jan-17
 Trump Reportedly Lost His Sh*t When He Realized The Women’s March Was Bigger Than His Inauguration,"Donald Trump threw a petty hissy fit in the White House.Prior to Sean Spicer scolding the media in the White House press room for accurately reporting on the crowd size at the inauguration, Donald Trump apparently threw a massive temper tantrum.According to White House sources who spoke to the Washington Post, Trump became  visibly enraged  after watching some of the Women s March on Washington the day after his inauguration because he realized that the march was way bigger than the meager crowd who showed up to for his swearing-in ceremony. Trump turned on the television to see a jarring juxtaposition   massive demonstrations around the globe protesting his day-old presidency and footage of the sparser crowd at his inauguration, with large patches of white empty space on the Mall,  the Post reported.  As his press secretary, Sean Spicer, was still unpacking boxes in his spacious new West Wing office, Trump grew increasingly and visibly enraged. Trump was adamant, aides said. Over the objections of his aides and advisers   who urged him to focus on policy and the broader goals of his presidency   the new president issued a decree: He wanted a fiery public response, and he wanted it to come from his press secretary.So now we know why Trump lied his ass off during a visit to CIA Headquarters about his inauguration crowd size and why Trump mouthpiece Sean Spicer was sent out to whine about press coverage of the inauguration.Trump completely lost his shit because he watched television expecting to hear nothing but nice things being said about him and instead heard the news that the Women s March was more popular.Seriously.It didn t even take a day for Trump to overtake George W. Bush as America s most embarrassing president. And considering Trump s agenda, it won t take him long to become the nation s most disastrous president either.Featured Image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,24-Jan-17
 Texas Republican Introduces Bill To Put Women In Prison For Having An Abortion,"Women in Texas may have to literally fight for their freedom and their lives to make sure this Republican lawmaker doesn t get his way.During the presidential campaign in 2016, Donald Trump actually mentioned jail and stated that women should receive  some form of punishment  for having an abortion.Well, Texas GOP Rep. Tony Tinderholt has introduced House Bill 948, which would punish any woman for having an abortion with prison time. The legislation contains ZERO exceptions for rape victims, victims of incest, and women who have to have an abortion to save their lives.During an interview with the Texas Observer, Tinderholt claimed that women use abortion as a form of birth control and that they are not  personally responsible  when they choose to have sex. Right now, it s real easy,  Tinderholt said.  Right now, they don t make it important to be personally responsible because they know that they have a backup of  oh, I can just go get an abortion.  Now, we both know that consenting adults don t always think smartly sometimes. But consenting adults need to also consider the repercussions of the sexual relationship that they re gonna have, which is a child. Tinderholt went on to interject his religious beliefs as one of his reasons for writing the legislation, stating that women should be forced to carry pregnancies to term because he s  a firm believer that God creates children in his own image, regardless of how that child is brought into the world, it s created in his image, and how can someone want to destroy that? The conservative lawmaker hopes to ban abortion by threatening women with the punishment of prison.Make no mistake, this is the most dangerous and extreme piece of anti-abortion legislation that has been filed across the nation and it would literally punish women for making decisions about their own reproductive health. The punishment could even extend to women who take birth control pills since many conservatives believe that contraceptives are a form of abortion, even though such medication prevents conception in the first place. It also could punish women who have natural miscarriages. The fact that Republicans even want to jail rape victims for refusing to carry their rapist s baby is also monstrous.And now we know why Tony Tinderholt has been divorced four times. Clearly, the women in his life can t stand him.Featured Image: Woman Survival",News,24-Jan-17
 Restaurant Owner Calls Black Customer ‘N*****’ Then Throws Him Out Because ‘Trump Is President Now’,"A Pennsylvania restaurant owner is under fire after he allegedly told a black customer that Donald Trump s election gives him the right to kick  n*ggers  out of his establishment. Rickey Lee Bugg Jr., a player on the Lebanon Valley College men s basketball team says he went to Just Wing It in Annville early Sunday morning.Shortly after ordering and paying, he had a rather unforgettable encounter with the owner. Bugg s sister posted about the incident on Facebook, explaining that the owner came out of the back and told him and some friends with whom he planned to eat to leave, informing them that  I own three restaurants and I don t need you n*ggers  money. Bugg asked the waitress for his money back and she agreed. After he got his money back, the owner decided to share more of his wisdom with Bugg: Trump s president now so I can say what I want. You ni*gers need to get out. According to Bugg s sister, the waitress was chiming in, telling the men,d  you guys can t eat here, you need to go.  Bugg admits that at this point, he flipped some chairs on his way out the door. I flipped a few chairs,  Bugg told PennLive, adding he yelled at the owner,  That s not the way to treat people.  He said the manager told him that now Donald Trump is president,  I can say what I want. He left and got some friends for support and returned to confront the racist store owner, but found that the police had been called. Unfortunately for the Trump fan, police were on Bugg s side. According to Bugg, police  reassured  him that the manager is  known for doing stuff like this. A quick search on Facebook reveals that the owner, Chris Behney, has quite a reputation: Others stopped by the comment section of PennLive to share their experiences and information:  An investigation into the incident is ongoing, but in a world where Trump supporters start a national incident because they thought Starbucks  delay in making their coffee was discrimination because the barista magically knew they were conservatives or think they shouldn t have to pay for a reusable bag because Trump won (and dissolve into a rage-filled racist rant), it s not exactly outside the realm of probability that the incident unfolded just as Bugg says.Featured image via Getty Images (Win McNamera)/screengrab",News,24-Jan-17
 You Can’t Make This Sh*t Up: Kellyanne Conway Punched A Dude At Inaugural Ball (SCREENSHOTS),"Remember that time Sarah Palin and pretty much her entire family got into a drunken brawl at a snowmobile company owner s birthday party? Well, she s not the only vapid right-wing lady who can throw a punch at random people at a party. Fox Business Network correspondent Charles Gasparino wrote on Facebook Monday that he personally witnessed something, well, something pretty hilarious at a private inaugural ball.Gasparino says he was hanging out with Scott Baio when the two were  accosted  by  anarchist thugs.  According to Gasparino, one of the  anarchists  moved toward them and he assaulted the man, shoving him. After Gasparino shoved him, the man allegedly told the pair touch me again u little prick and I ll smack u    you know, because most people don t appreciate being randomly shoved. It is unclear if it was said with the same terrible spelling. Gasparino says he told the man to  GFY  when his producer intervened and  crisis was averted. It is unclear if Gasparino realizes he admitted to assaulting a guy simply for moving in his direction (allegedly), but what he says next is far more interesting:Part two was even more insane: inside the ball we see a fight between two guys in tuxes and then suddenly out of nowhere came trump adviser Kellyanne Conway who began throwing some mean punches at one of the guys. Whole thing lasted a few mins no one was hurt except maybe the dude she smacked. Now I know why trump hired her. Btw I exaggerate none of this-cgLet s get this straight: Conway lost control of her own people, whom she could not keep from duking it out at a major political event celebrating her boss s big win, then decided to join in the fray and just beat the living hell out of one of them.Hell of a team Trump s building, huh?You can read the full post below:Featured image via Getty Images (Mark Wilson)",News,24-Jan-17
 WATCH Trump Absolutely CRUSH His Wife In Viral Video Clip From Inauguration,"Many people have long suspected that Trump is abusive, if for no other reason than he s outwardly abusive to so many people. His Twitter feed alone is rife with abuse. He seems to take pleasure in hurting people, and that appears to include his family, because abusers abuse everyone in one form or another.During his inauguration, as he stood facing Melania, he apparently said something extremely hurtful to her. She s smiling and, if you look at his cheeks, he seems to be smiling too, and then suddenly, his smile disappears and he turns pointedly away from her. You can see from the change in her expression that whatever he said just crushed her.Watch below:Wouldn t he want the world to see how happy the two of them are, even if it is a fa ade? What could she have possibly done to warrant this, anyway? Say she really did do something worthy of rebuke   he could have, and should have, waited until they were alone to say something to her. The way he did it wasn t just crushing to her, it was probably also humiliating for her.That wasn t the only time he was demeaning, either. When he greeted the Obamas prior to his inauguration, he left her behind in the car, and then left her behind again to walk into the White House. It was President Obama and Michelle who actually escorted Melania inside.But that s where Trump gets satisfaction   in shaming and humiliating people as much as possible for even the slightest transgressions. Typical emotionally abusive behavior. Some may say she knew what she was getting into when she got involved with him, but that s victim-blaming, and it comes from those who don t get it.It s extremely unlikely Melania deserved whatever he said to her, or his self-satisfied, deliberately supercilious manner when he turned his back on her.Featured image by Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images",News,24-Jan-17
 Trump HUMILIATED By Presidential Historian’s Devastating Evaluation Of His First Days,"Trump s first few days in the White House have been tumultuous, and not just because he s so upset about his inauguration numbers being less-than record-setting that he had his press secretary flat-out lie about them. His aides have revealed that his thin skin is making things difficult, and because of that, presidential historian Douglas Brinkley has weighed in with something rather embarrassing for a man obsessed with numbers and image: [H]e can never let go and stop watching cable TV. Now he s off to the worst start of a presidency in a very long time.  [emphasis mine]The worst. In a very long time. Those are words Trump won t want to hear, seeing as how he thinks he is the best and has the best of absolutely everything. An expert calling him the worst at anything just burns.Brinkley believes Trump had a successful inauguration despite his numbers being lower than expected, and he should have built on that. However, given that he s so quick to anger when someone anyone makes him look bad to the world, he fixates on that instead of real issues and real work, and it s causing huge problems. Sources within the White House revealed that his aides have to control what information he s exposed to: One person who frequently talks to Trump said aides have to push back privately against his worst impulses in the White House, like the news conference idea, and have to control information that may infuriate him. He gets bored and likes to watch TV, this person said, so it is important to minimize that. Really? We have someone in our nation s highest office who gets bored easily and so he watches TV to, what, look for reports about how great he is? And then TV doesn t deliver, which pisses him off, and he goes off on tangents and people get frustrated. Even members of the GOP are floored by his behavior, like the news conference about his inaugural audience: It s surreal. We finally have the White House, and it s this. Yes, it s quite surreal that we have a narcissistic toddler in the White House.The Washington Post s Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker and Matea Gold said that, when he came back from his final inaugural event on Saturday, he turned on the TV, saw the Women s Marches, saw them protesting his presidency, and worst of all, saw that the protesting crowds appeared bigger than his own audience. So he got increasingly pissed off, and, seemingly on a whim, had Spicer give that press conference that was one lie after another, and culminated in Kellyanne Conway s  alternate facts  bullshit.And then Trump was unhappy with Spicer s  visuals    meaning he didn t like how Spicer appeared nervous, flubbed some of his words, wore a badly-fitting suit, and was apparently not forceful enough with the  lying press. Besides that, there are all the power struggles plaguing Trump s administration that are very reminiscent of the power struggles that plagued his campaign. Some are upset with his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, trying to shove anyone he sees as a threat to his position as a close adviser aside. Aides are unhappy that Kellyanne Conway can do what she wants, when she wants, because she s outside the official communications department. And the list goes on.The word  worst  is not in Trump s vocabulary when he s talking about himself. Brinkley, however, knows what s what and is apparently not afraid to say it.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,24-Jan-17
 Trump Legally Declares His Inauguration A Historic Day,"Donald Trump is apparently so upset about his inauguration s turnout, and the negative press attention afterward, that he s literally used his power as president to declare it a historic day   four days after it happened.Using the power of the executive order, Donald Trump has arrogantly designated January 20, 2017 as the  National Day of Patriotic Devotion. No, this isn t a joke. This is reality. And no, this isn t North Korea, this is the United States of America.The order reads (in part):Now, therefore, I Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 2017, as National Day of Patriotic Devotion, in order to strengthen our bonds to each other and to our country   and to renew the duties of government to the people.While millions of women march for equality, the White House Press Secretary lies to the American people, and the unavoidable conflicts of interests and Russian secrets sow doubt in American minds, Trump decides to make his  special day  a national holiday  for the people. This is what American politics has come to.I m young enough to remember when Republicans thought President Obama was arrogant and narcissistic for putting arugula on his hamburger.But Trump wants to proclaim a day all for himself and his glory (after losing the popular vote by 3 million)? Not a peep from the right.Imagine the outcry from the Republicans and Fox News if President Obama had even referred to his inauguration day as such   to say nothing of what they d do if he d ordered it.Remembering that Trump did indeed lose the popular vote by 3 million, it would seem inappropriate to declare his inauguration a national day of  devotion. No one devoted themselves to Trump. No one devoted themselves to Mike Pence. And no one devoted themselves to the government. Want to know why? The government devotes itself to the people, not vice versa.Trump has turned the office of the presidency into a spectacle showboat of admiration for himself. Woe to all the pundits and those in the media who promised and hoped for a pivot. And an even bigger woe to all those who voted for him thinking the same thing.Move over Kim Jong-Un, there s a new  Dear Leader  amongst us.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images",News,24-Jan-17
 People Are Going To LOSE IT When They Discover What Trump Is Doing With DAPL,"This should come as a surprise to no one ever because alleged president Donald Trump has a seedy financial interest in the Dakota Access Access Pipeline. Energy Transfers Partners, the very company that is the pipeline, donated $100,000 to a Trump Victory Fund before the election in the hopes that he d greenlight it, Mother Jones reported.In fact, according to disclosure forms at the time, Trump had as much as $300,000 personally invested in the project.As it happens, our alleged president will likely overturn a permit denial that prohibited the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which was the focus of months of massive protests by Native Americans and others who took part in the demonstrations, the Independent reports. I m not going to get in front of the President s executive actions,  Spicer said,  but I will tell you that areas like the Dakota and Keystone pipeline are areas that we can increase jobs, increase economic growth, and tap into America s energy supply. That s something that he s been very clear about. Without elaborating, Press Secretary Sean Spicer did not provide specifics about the newly minted president s plans regarding continuing construction of the DAPL and the Keystone XL Pipeline. However, Spicer did suggest that the new administration would move forward with the project.Trump s plan to go forward with the Dakota Access Pipeline isn t going down well on social media.Spicer won t  get in front  of Trump on Keystone or #DAPL, but people will sure as hell get in front of Keystone & #DAPL to stop them.  Travis Nichols (@travisjnichols) January 23, 2017The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced this past December that it would not grant the final permit that was needed for the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline to be completed. It additionally stated that it would conduct an environmental impact review before continuing any part of the process.Get this: Trump is not behind the Standing Rock Tribe, and that is most likely because he has a financial interest in the pipeline.

 WATCH: Bill O’Reilly Just Said The Women’s Marches Were Just Like Totalitarian Regimes,"Bill O Reilly can always be trusted to be a total ass, especially when it comes to anything that runs counter to his myopic worldview. The Women s Marches, which took place all over the world and included three million women here at home, seem to be his latest target. In a conversation with Charles Krauthammer, O Reilly went completely off the rails and actually compared the marches to totalitarianism.As Krauthammer talked about the real people who showed up to the Women s March on Washington, he obviously touched a nerve with O Reilly, who thinks women don t do anything unless they re told to: Don t you feel they showed up because they were told to show up? If you look at the totalitarian governments in the 20th century- Krauthammer, despite having his own bizarre view of the marches, seemed incredulous. He tried to interrupt with,  You re told to show up? Who tells anybody to show up in this country? It s important to note that Krauthammer is not exactly the most liberal of pundits, yet O Reilly really floored him with this. Krauthammer did bring up a good point: When people do what they re told, it s because there will be negative consequences if they don t. O Reilly decided to try and explain what the consequences are, and he fell flat on his face: Well, they have to go   they don t have to go through a negative, they have to go to be with her brothers and sisters, and to show their solidarity and that they are good people and fight the fascist racists. I mean, it s a whip up, and if you study history, all the totalitarian regimes were fueled by whip-ups, okay? Really? It s not possible that anybody went because they had something to say? Nobody went because they were told to or because they were afraid of bad things should they not go. Women went because they had something to say.And if anybody s totalitarian here, it s the massive Cheeto living in the White House now. O Reilly is being just as stupid as ever with this and Krauthammer can t really believe it. Watch below:Featured image via screen capture",News,23-Jan-17
" Obama And THREE Other Presidents Dwarf Trump’s Inaugural Audience, And These Numbers PROVE It","Trump and his minions act like they re dead certain his inaugural numbers broke records, and that the press is lying about it via deceptively edited photos and numbers that can t possibly exist. Sean Spicer claimed that Trump s inaugural audience was the biggest in history, period, while Trump himself said he could see maybe 1.5 million people out there. Then Spicer tried to spin it to sound like he was talking about all viewers   the live crowds, television audience, and people who streamed it online.Oh, well, when you put it that way, we suppose it s possible Trump s inauguration was the most-watched in history.Or is it?It s not.The actual numbers don t support any version of their insistence that Trump s numbers broke records. The Washington Post did an analysis of inaugural numbers, past and present, and found that Trump doesn t even rank in the top three.In fact, he s in fifth place in modern history when you count the television audience. He s behind Obama in 2009, Nixon in 1973, Carter in 1977 and Reagan in 1981. In fact, Reagan s  81 inauguration at 41.8 million is where the record is, and where it will remain. Trump s 33.5 million total misses that by a hefty factor:Chart via the Washington PostAmazingly enough, Spicer does have one fairly accurate number   the 16.9 million people who he says streamed the inauguration. He s using it in a very deceptive way, though. That number is how many started streaming, but then switched to something else or turned it off entirely. The number of people who started streaming and stayed put was just 2.3 million at the time Trump took his oath of office.He s still behind Reagan and Obama, and also behind Carter s 34.1 million.And he misses Obama s numbers by a whopping 6 million. Obama had over 30 million presumable streaming starts for his inauguration that year. Even if all 30 million turned it off (they didn t), Obama still comes out ahead.The Post report also mentions that Trump s audience is older than Obama s audience was, so it s not nearly as likely that more of his remote viewers streamed it online rather than watched it on TV.It doesn t matter how you slice it; Trump s numbers were nothing special.Featured image by Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images",News,23-Jan-17
 Trump Escalates Confrontation With China In Move That Could Spark A Massive War,"Donald Trump is moving the United States closer to a war with China over some tiny islands.The relationship between the United States has been cordial and peaceful for decades now, but Trump plans to change all that. For someone who claims that our military is depleted, Trump sure has no problem putting our country on the brink of war.China is currently making claims to islands in the South China Sea, which is an international body of water. The matter could probably be settled through diplomacy, but Trump has chosen to bully China instead. And he is inviting a catastrophic war in the process.According to Reuters,The comments at a briefing from White House spokesman Sean Spicer signaled a sharp departure from years of cautious U.S. handling of China s assertive pursuit of territory claims in Asia, just days after Trump took office on Friday. The U.S. is going to make sure that we protect our interests there,  Spicer said when asked if Trump agreed with comments by his Secretary of State nominee, Rex Tillerson, on Jan. 11 that China should not be allowed access to islands it has built in the contested South China Sea. It s a question of if those islands are in fact in international waters and not part of China proper, then yeah, we re going to make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country,  he said.Tillerson s remarks at his Senate confirmation hearing prompted Chinese state media to say the United States would need to  wage war  to bar China s access to the islands where it has built military-length air strips and installed weapons systems.The strong language suggests Trump is considering military action or a naval blockade to keep the islands out of Chinese hands, but even Chinese state media has warned that such action would lead to war between the two nations.And that would be a catastrophe. Not only would this be a war between two nuclear powers, it would be a war between the two largest economies in the world, which means a war between China and the United States would have serious global ramifications.But war is apparently what Trump is thinking about as he has repeatedly treated China with antagonism since before Election Day.And Americans should not expect our allies to help us either. If Trump starts a war with China, America would be on its own. Our troops would be fighting and dying because of Trump s fragile ego. The deficit and the national debt would also skyrocket, especially since Trump has promised Corporate America that he will cut their taxes in half, which would deprive the government of revenues to keep our military strong. That means Trump will get the revenues from the middle class and the poor.China s military and navy are improving rapidly, and they are the most populous nation on Earth. That means Trump would have a reinstate the military draft he himself dodged during the Vietnam War to get enough soldiers to put on the front lines. Even thinking about a military confrontation is insane.The longer Trump is allowed to remain in office, the more dangerous he becomes. This country is now on a path to a war that will cripple our nation and Trump doesn t give a damn because he thinks it makes him look tough. In reality, it just makes him look like an idiot.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,23-Jan-17
 Sean Spicer Just Gave ‘Alternative Facts’ About Women’s March And Got OBLITERATED (TWEETS),"Is there any level to which Trump s press secretary, Sean Spicer, will not sink on behalf of his lying boss? It seems not. In another press conference today, he addressed the sheer size and scope of the Women s Marches, which took place all over the world, and said that they weren t protesting against Trump: A lot of these people were there to protest an issue of concern to them and not against anything. Yeah, sure, alternative facts aren t facts and people aren t buying the alternative facts that Spicer and Trump have to sell. The Women s Marches were absolutely about Trump, his election, and his misogyny   women were sending him a message that we will not tolerate any efforts to step up oppression of us.That s reflected in the way Twitter responded to Spicer:@seanspicer I travelled 1200 miles to DC from Nebraska for the Women s March, and every marcher I spoke to along the way was anti-trump.

 Trump Gets Revenge On Women’s March By Signing Executive Order That Will Kill A Bunch Of Women And Girls,"How mad is Trump that millions of women made him look like a fool? Mad enough to kill, apparently. While he can t order the executions of American women for defying him yet President Pussygrabber did the next best thing. He signed an executive order that will lead to the deaths of multitudes of women and girls worldwide.On Monday, The Donald continued the path of destruction he began with his first executive order attacking Obamacare by unleashing an assault on the women and girls of the world. One of Trump s growing number of executive orders reinstates the  global gag rule,  which blocks federal funding for international, nongovernmental organizations that provide or  promote  abortions.In short, if your organization were to partner with Planned Parenthood to inform girls and women across the globe about reproductive health like, say, the Clinton Foundation, people like Trump could argue that you are  promoting  abortion by mentioning it as a medically legitimate option.The policy was originally developed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Ever since then, Presidents who care about human rights like Obama and Clinton have been rescinding it. Republicans, however, being part of a party that combats women s rights at every turn, typically reinstate it.How harmful is it? Mother Jones reports:According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, women in poor countries suffer the most from this policy. A 2003 analysis found that the rule leads to unsafe abortions, which are the second-leading cause of death for women of reproductive age in Ethiopia and account for more than 40 percent of the maternal mortality rate in Kenya. Peru has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in Latin America, in part because of its high rate of clandestine abortions.The United States currently spends about $600 million annually on family planning and reproductive health programs in foreign countries. The Guttmacher Institute, a think tank that studies reproductive health care, estimates that a loss of this funding would translate to 38,000 more abortions. Marie Stopes International, one of USAID s biggest family planning partners, estimates that the global gag rule will lead to an additional 2.2 million abortions worldwide.Trump s order comes on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade and directly follows a nationwide three-million women march against Trump and his hate.

 Inaugural Cake Baker Brilliantly Schools Anti-Gay Bakers In How Protest Is Done,"Around the time same sex marriage was making headlines, a handful of cake bakers across the country threw temper tantrums and refused to bake wedding cakes for anyone who didn t pass their rigid moral test (i.e., wasn t marrying someone of the opposite sex). While these cake bakers claimed it was their First Amendment right to refuse service, the Supreme Court said it wasn t.What a difference a couple of years makes. Today, we have a new president and bigotry is now cool. One cake baker, though, was asked to bake Donald Trump s inaugural cake. They did it, but they donated the profits to a charity Trump would hate, the Human Rights Campaign.The whole situation is weird to begin with. Trump wanted an exact duplicate of the cake that celebrity chef Duff Goldman baked for the 2013 inauguration.The cake on the left is the one I made for President Obama s inauguration 4 years ago.

 Trump Bans The Public From Calling The White House To Comment Or Protest,"In another attempt to stifle freedom of expression, President Trump and his administration have dismantled the White House switchboard comment operating system. Instead, callers will be told to take their complaints and comments to Facebook and other White House social media platforms.When called, the White House switchboard states: Thank you for calling the White House comments line. The comment line is currently closed but your comment is important to the President and we urge you to send us a comment online at www.WhiteHouse.gov/contact or send us a message through Facebook messenger. Trump really is becoming the social-media president.Since the end of the transition, when the lines were apparently shut off, the Trump administration has been purging the White House website off all things that generally resemble the Obama White House   and thus anything that has to do with equality and inclusion. So this is just another instance of curtailing the openness of the people s house.It seems that the 15 percent of American households without internet will not be able to have Trump hear their concerns, who promised to be a champion of all people and listen to their needs.There is no indication yet from the White House whether this is permanent or temporary, as the incoming administration settles into their positions.Still, there was no downtime for this crucial line of democracy when the Obama administration took over in 2009.Given the Trump administration s penchant for lying and ignoring the people, this should come as no surprise. However, it should worry the public if no future action is taken to address this. The people s house should be readily available at all times, in all fashions.It s only day three, and Donald Trump and his team are showing a brazen disregard for the little things that make us great. When studying authoritarians, one must look at how the littlest of things change before their eyes.This might be one of them   a White House that doesn t want to be bombarded with calls from an outraged public.Featured image by Ron Sachs via Getty Images",News,23-Jan-17
" Press Asks Sean Spicer To Prove Trump Left Businesses, His Response Is INFURIATING (VIDEO)","Donald Trump and his team are getting absolutely hammered for their lies or   as they called it    alternate facts.  And rightfully so   Trump hasn t even been President for a week and his team is already proving to be riddled with falsehoods and a complete lack of transparency.On Monday, new White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer gave a truly infuriating response during his first White House press conference. When a member of the press asked Spicer if he could produce some sort of proof to validate the claims that Trump had resigned from his businesses, America got a terrifying look at what the next four years were going to bring.Spicer said  I believe we have  to a question regarding documents showing that Trump had handed his businesses over to his two sons. However, White House staffer Hope Hicks jumped in and stated that these documents are not public.  Spicer continued: Yeah, but he has resigned from the company as he said he would before he took office. Don and Eric are fully in charge of the company. He s taking extraordinary steps to ensure that that s happened. So once again, we have more and more secrecy from Trump s team combined with a lack of kept promises to the American people. It should be noted that ProPublica stated that Trump has not stepped away from his businesses at all.As of last Friday, ProPublica examined several of Trump s major companies. These companies were registered in three different states   Florida, Delaware and New York.

" Because Of Trump, We Need An Equal Rights Amendment NOW","The Women s March was historic. Over four million women all across the country (and world) came out in solidarity to protest against the incoming avalanche of assault from the Trump Administration.Contrary to popular belief, the Women s March was not a protest against President Trump   it was a protest in support of women s rights.Before taking the oath of office, the Trump Administration pledged to defund all programs at the DOJ which enforce the Violence Against Women Act. Donald Trump himself has released the names of 21 conservative judges who are potential Supreme Court nominees that mirror the late Justice Antonin Scalia (who does not believe the 14th Amendment extends to women).On Monday, January 23, Trump signed an executive order imposing the  Mexico City  rule   that overseas operations (including clinics) that perform or encourage abortion will lose all federal funding from the United States.The war on women is in full force, and Trump is at the reins.That is why, now more than ever, an Equal Rights Amendment is needed.The proposal is a simple one:Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.Aside from the 20th Amendment, which gives women the right to vote, there is no specific mention of women in the United States Constitution. The word  men  is mentioned a handful of times. The words  women,   ladies,  or  female  is nowhere. Not one line in the United States Constitution even alludes to the rights of women when considering historical context (aside from the 20th). Nor is the word  equality  found anywhere.Even though the Constitution states  All men are created equal,  we know that the Founders truly did not understand that. If you weren t white, a landowner, or male, the Constitution was not written with your rights in mind. Thomas Jefferson, who authored the Declaration of Independence and made significant contributions to the Constitution, wrote:Were our state a pure democracy there would still be excluded from our deliberations women, who, to prevent deprivation of morals and ambiguity of issues, should not mix promiscuity in gatherings of men.What many people fail to realize is that the rights of women that hinge on the 14th Amendment s Equal Protection Clause can easily be taken away. The 14th Amendment says that states may not  deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.  Should a Congress or bench of judges hold hostile views of women s equality, they could deem it necessary to roll back on much of the social progress made through common or statutory law. Should Trump appoint one, two or even three new Justices to the Supreme Court, who hold originalist views like Scalia, many issues such as equal pay, abortion, insurance discrimination, and so forth could vanish or become embedded in sex discrimination.The only thing women truly, inarguably have is the right to vote. But what s the point of voting if your rights as a human being could be taken away down the road in the name of jurisprudence?The argument  women already have everything the ERA would guarantee them  is not only wrong but na ve. First, women don t have  everything  equal to men in current law. There are still many statutes that separate on the basis of sex. Second, only the ERA would truly guarantee them these fundamental rights without fear of being stripped away so easily. So those opposed to the ERA actually give us a reason to support it   they admit it would guarantee equality if enacted.This wasn t always a divisive issue. Republicans use to support it. Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford supported the ERA in the 1970s, as did President Carter. This was not a partisan issue until Phyllis Schlafly came along and derailed it using scare tactics (one argument was that this would lead to same-sex marriage).But Schlafly is gone (as is Ford and Nixon), and a new era for women is on the horizon. If women came out in support for an Equal Rights Amendment as they did on January 21st, equality would be the true law of the land.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,23-Jan-17
" Border Chief Just Gave Trump A BRUTAL Reality Check About His Border Wall, Supporters DEVASTATED (VIDEO)","During his presidential campaign, former reality television star Donald Trump received a lot of criticism for his highly controversial (and completely wasteful and illogical) U.S.-Mexican border wall   a concept his supporters latched onto despite the fact that it was shot down by several experts.Just days after officially becoming the 45th President of the United States, Trump is getting another brutal reality check about why this stupid wall won t work. Now, the outgoing chief of the Customs and Border Protection agency is speaking out against the idea, crushing every racist s hopes and dreams.In an interview with ABC News  Brian Ross, border chief Gil Kerlikowske basically said that Trump s border wall was a massive waste of both time and money, and not a viable solution to tackling illegal immigration. Completely humiliating Trump for being an ill-advised moron, Kerlikowske said: I think that anyone who s been familiar with the southwest border and the terrain  kind of recognizes that building a wall along the entire southwest border is probably not going to work. There s nothing that Trump hates more than being called out for being stupid and wrong. Maybe if he d actually spent more time learning about his new job than crying on Twitter, he would have known this. Kerlikowske also stated that not only would this wall not work, but the cost of this wall in both time and finances would be a major burden on taxpayers   because despite how many times Trump says Mexico is going to pay for his wall, they ve made it VERY clear that they re not. Kerlikowske continued: I don t think the wall is feasible. I don t think its particularly the smartest way to use taxpayer money on infrastructure. To make matters even worse for Trump, Kerlikowske used this interview to defend and praise the Obama Administration for its record on illegal immigration. Take that, Trump!You can watch the interview below:Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,23-Jan-17
 Conservatives Attack The Pope And DEFEND HITLER After The Pope Warns Against Donald Trump (TWEETS),"As Donald Trump was being sworn in as Grand Wizard of the United States, Pope Francis was throwing shade at our new President-With-An-Asterisk in an interview with a Spanish newspaper.He didn t address Trump directly in his interview with El Pais   after all, where s the fun in that?   but instead talked about someone of whom many Trump supporters are fond, Adolf Hitler: Germany   was looking for a leader, someone who would give her back her identity and there was a little man named Adolf Hitler who said  I can do it .   Hitler did not steal power. He was elected by his people and then he destroyed his people.  The Germans at that time also wanted to protect themselves with  walls and barbed wire so that others cannot take away their identity. It doesn t take much imagination at all to see the similarities. Immediately after Trump assumed office, any mention of civil rights disappeared from the White House website and he immediately signed an executive order aimed at taking healthcare away from millions of Americans. The case of Germany is classic,  he said, adding that Hitler gave his citizens a  deformed identity and we know what it produced.  In other words, Germany first, America first, it s all the same. But Pope Francis says to give Trump a chance to prove him right: Let s see. Let s see what he does and then we will evaluate. Naturally, conservatives are furious.

 Trump Plans To Turn Medicaid Into A Death Panel Program With Limited Funding,"People who voted for Donald Trump and receive Medicaid are about to get some really bad news.For decades, Republicans have wanted to destroy Medicaid, a healthcare program that helps low income people with a combination of federal and state resources.The idea of block grants would mostly achieve this goal by slashing the amount of money the federal government provides and would shift the fiscal responsibility to the states.According to the New York Times,A block grant would be a radical change. Since its creation in 1965, Medicaid has been an open-ended entitlement. If more people become eligible because of a recession, or if costs go up because of the use of expensive new medicines, states receive more federal money.If Congress decides to create block grants for Medicaid, lawmakers will face thorny questions with huge political and financial implications: How much money will each state receive? How will the initial allotments be adjusted   for population changes, for general inflation, for increases in medical prices, for the discovery of new drugs and treatments? Will the federal government require states to cover certain populations and services? Will states receive extra money if they have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, but decide to do so in the future?Also, Republicans could punish blue states by giving them less money while giving more money to red states.But once the money runs out, people will suffer regardless of which state they live in because that s what a block grant is. It s a set amount of money. States would have to decide if they want to spend more money on healthcare after the funding dries up. Basically, lawmakers will be deciding if you get medical care or not. In other words, death panels.Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker told Republicans in Congress that,  States would most likely make decisions based mainly on fiscal reasons rather than the health care needs of vulnerable populations. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards echoed the same concerns. Under such a scenario, flexibility would really mean flexibility to cut critical services for our most vulnerable populations, including poor children, people with disabilities and seniors in need of nursing home and home-based care,  he said.Again, this is basically the death panels Sarah Palin was freaking out about when the Affordable Care Act passed, only these are real and would be run by the states because the federal government is forcing them to decide who gets care and who doesn t by imposing funding limits.Medicaid covers more than 70 million Americans across the country, many of whom are conservatives in some of the poorest states. That s 70 million people who are going to face great suffering and death over the next four years if Trump and Republicans have their way.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,23-Jan-17
 Trump Tells Corporate CEOs He Will Slash 75 Percent Of Regulations That Protect Workers And Environment,"Donald Trump just promised Corporate America that they ll be able to rape the environment and screw over their workers at will after his administration is done killing every regulation in the book.During a meeting with corporate executives on Monday, Trump told them that he will cut their tax rate  massively  by up to more than half the current rate of 35 percent, which would significantly reduce revenues the federal government will take in.In short, that means Trump is copying what Republicans did in Kansas, a move that has destroyed the state s economy while blowing up the budget with massive deficits.Trump also said that if a corporation wants to build a factory his team will expedite the process to make sure it happens even if doing so threatens vital habitats.He then stated his intention to wipe out  75 percent or more  of the current regulations that protect workers and the environment. The regulations are going to be cut massively,  Trump said.  And the taxes are going to be cut way down. But he insisted that workers and the environment will somehow still be protected despite the loss of the regulations that actually do protect them.Here s the video via Facebook.Donald Trump just became even more of a threat to workers, the environment, and the nation s fiscal health.Most of these regulations exist for a reason and we should not just be cutting because Trump heard a sob story from a greedy corporate CEO.But he s apparently going to do it anyway and that means American workers can expect to see regulations that protect their safety, wages, and rights disappear and then when they get home they ll have to deal with the dirty air and poisoned water that results from Trump s repel of environmental regulations.Every voter who sat home pouting or voted for a third party because Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee should be ashamed of themselves. Because in the end, while Trump is going to be responsible for our nation s destruction, you are to blame for enabling him to do so in the first place.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,23-Jan-17
 The Dallas Stars HILARIOUSLY Troll Donald Trump Over The Size Of His Inaugural Crowd (IMAGE),"While Trump is busy trying to convince the world that he s the most popular president in history, others who know the truth are sitting back and laughing. That includes the Dallas Stars, the hockey team from the very-red state of Texas. They decided they were going to poke fun at Trump over his claim that there had to be at least 1.5 million people at his inauguration (there weren t), and they did so using their Jumbotron:Stars Jumbotron with a topical joke. pic.twitter.com/9vsmTG1Agj  Kate Morrison (@unlikelyfanatic) January 22, 2017Yes, that says their attendance was 1.5 million. This is their way of drawing attention to the fact that, as Mashable put it: Donald Trump is really, really obsessed with numbers, especially those that reflect his popularity, sending members of his staff into the world armed with  lies  and  alternative facts  to claim the attendance at his inauguration was HYUGE. Kate Morrison, the person who tweeted the pic of the Stars  Jumbotron, apparently received several thousand retweets within a half hour. As of the time of this posting, she had well over 18,000 retweets, and more than 37,000 likes.The Stars do tend to be irreverent when it comes to egotistical celebrities and their own opponents. They ve trolled Justin Bieber and Toronto; and they went after the city of Winnipeg, too, where they posted a list of  reasons  to visit Winnipeg that included,  Any suggestions?  and  Go visit Vancouver instead. So this isn t anything new, but it is hilarious given Trump s inauguration and his ego. He s so embarrassed by the size of his inaugural crowd that his press secretary, Sean Spicer, told a a series of outright lies in an attempt to convince us that all evidence to the contrary, no matter how obvious, was fabricated.The Stars actually had a crowd closer to 18,500   there s no sports arena in the U.S. that can hold anything close to 1.5 million people. But that doesn t matter   if Trump will lie about his numbers, then there are people who will counter with something as embarrassing as possible for him.Featured image via screen captures from embedded tweet",News,23-Jan-17
 Dan Rather Takes Kellyanne Conway To The Woodshed; Advises The Media On How To Handle Lies,"After Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the gall to defend blatant Trump administration lies as  alternative facts,  Dan Rather, one of the few real journalists left in our country, took to Facebook and called for action. These are not normal times,  Rather said.  These are extraordinary times. And extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. Conway wasn t the only person who suffered Rather s wrath, but he called her phrase  Orwellian,  which it was. Rather also talked about Sean Spicer, who, as he said, threatened, bullied and lied to reporters before walking out of the briefing room without even answering a question. He also called out the administration for its lies.Rather remarked that we ve never seen this before, but he has some suggestions for the media. The first of which is to not be afraid to call a lie a lie. Even more than from the press, though, Rather wants to see that kind of bravery come from Congress.There is one group of people who can do a lot   very quickly. And that is Republicans in Congress. Without their support, Donald Trump s presidency will falter. So here is what I think everyone in the press must do. If you are interviewing a Paul Ryan, a Mitch McConnell, or any other GOP elected official, the first question must be  what will you do to combat the lying from the White House?  If they dodge and weave, keep with the follow ups. And if they refuse to give a satisfactory answer, end the interview.Facts and the truth are not partisan. They are the bedrock of our democracy. And you are either with them, with us, with our Constitution, our history, and the future of our nation, or you are against it. Everyone must answer that question.It s true. If the media does its job, the truth will win out and  alternative fact  will be called simply,  lies. Featured image via Kirk Irwin/Getty Images",News,22-Jan-17
 WATCH: Former Clinton Aide BLASTS Lying Sean Spicer; Says He Should Resign,"The internet has been destroying the Trump administration s press secretary, former Republican National Committee mouthpiece Sean Spicer. As everyone now knows, Spicer spent his very first press briefing lying about Trump s inaugural crowd size as compared to those of President Barack Obama. Of course, we all know that President Obama s 2009 crowd size reached historic numbers, exceeding one million people. When comparison photos were tweeted out, this was clearly just too much for Trump s fragile ego, so he sent Spicer out to rag on the press for reporting, well, facts about Trump s pathetic crowds.Well, since this administration clearly has no issue with lying straight to the faces of the American people, Brian Fallon, the former press secretary for Hillary for America, went on CNN to weigh in on what he would have done had he ever been put in the position of lying to the American public regarding this or anything else. Fallon said: There s clear intent. It was a lie. It should be called a lie. And if he was put in the situation by [Chief of Staff] Reince Priebus or his boss, Donald Trump, to go out and tell a lie to the American people, he should have resigned rather than go out and take the podium. Spicer, of course, lied through his teeth, and said, as he blasted the press: This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe. This is simply untrue, and there are photos and numbers to prove it. But the ease of fact-checking such a thing matters not to the Trump White House. In fact, while speaking to NBC s Chuck Todd on Sunday, Kellyanne Conway called Spicer s lies  alternative facts,  as if refusing to call them what they are lies makes everything just a-okay.Fallon continued, saying that he s never been asked to do any such thing, but he hoped he wouldn t do what Spicer did after being asked by CNN s Brian Stelter what he d have done if he were asked to lie like that: But I d like to think that if I ever was, I would have too much integrity to go out and look in the cameras and say something that was provably false. Then again, Brian Fallon would never be in such a position, because a) Hillary would never ask her staff to do such a thing because she s not a petulant brat like Trump is, and b) she wouldn t need to, because her inaugural crowds would have reached record highs as well.Too bad we ll never know what could have been, and we re stuck with this orange moron for at least four years.Watch the exchange below:[ad3media campaign= 1422 ]Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,22-Jan-17
 Beloved NBA Coach Openly Calls Trump A Dangerous Liar (DETAILS),"San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich is no fan of Donald Trump. He sharply criticized Trump in the run-up to the election, and now that Trump is officially in office, he seems to have no interest in giving the Orange One so much as an inch. In a recent interview, Popovich openly called Trump a liar, and specifically criticized his activities when he went to speak to the CIA   especially Trump s speaking about the size of his crowds in front of a wall representing fallen operatives. He also said that the massive women s march was  great.  Popovich said: That message is important, and it could have been a whole lot of groups marching. And somebody said on TV,  What s their message?  Well, their message is obvious. That our president comes in with the lowest [approval] rating of anybody who ever came into the office. And there s a majority of people out there, since Hillary [Clinton] won the popular vote, that don t buy his act. Popovich then went on to criticize Trump s bigoted remarks against any number of groups of Americans during the campaign and since: He could talk to the groups that he disrespected and maligned during the primary and really make somebody believe it. But so far, we ve got [to] a point where you really can t believe anything that comes out of his mouth. You really can t. The coach then moved on Trump s speech at the CIA, and called him emotionally immature and a liar: That s worrisome. That s worrisome. I d just feel better if somebody was in that position that showed the maturity and psychological and emotional level of somebody that was his age. It does boggle the mind how somebody can be so thin-skinned. It s all obvious   it s about him. If anything affects him, if it s  Saturday Night Live  or  Hamilton  or she got 3 more million votes than you.  They re illegal.' It doesn t matter what it is, there s a pattern there. And that s dangerous. I d like to have someone with gravitas, but he got there through the Electoral College, which is part of our system, and I hope he does some good things. Hopefully, people with megaphones continue to speak out against Trump and his dishonest, autocratic administration. If we hold their feet to the fire, we just might survive the next four years.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,22-Jan-17
 The Dictionary Delivers EPIC Smackdown Of Kellyanne Conway’s ‘Alternative Facts’ Bullsh*t,"This morning, Kellyanne Conway attempted to spin White House press secretary Sean Spicer s blatant lies about Trump s inauguration numbers into simply an alternate version of the truth. This isn t the first time she s said something like this, and so it s getting more than a little ridiculous. Fortunately, Chuck Todd nailed her to the wall for it, but he wasn t the only one. Merriam-Webster decided to nail her for it too, with a short, concise tweet:?A fact is a piece of information presented as having objective reality. https://t.co/gCKRZZm23c  Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) January 22, 2017Nothing like having the dictionary troll you when you try to redefine words in front of the whole damn world.Merriam-Webster didn t stop with just a single tweet, though. That link goes to an entire article blasting Conway for pretending the word  fact  doesn t mean what we think it means. In addition to the modern definition, which is their tweet, they gave three obsolete definitions which further puts Conway to shame: There are three obsolete senses of fact in English. Two of these senses are no longer used:Fact meaning  a wrong or unlawful deed  is rare, but is still used in the phrase  after the fact. Merriam-Webster also reported, in that story, that lookups for the word  fact  spiked after Conway spewed her nonsense all over Chuck Todd. Fact  is their #2 lookup today, and  feminism  is their #3 lookup. Their #1 lookup, though?  Fascism.  That s been one of their trending lookups for a few months now, which says something about how people on both sides view Trump.You know you ve screwed up big time with a word when you ve got the dictionary coming after you for it.Featured image by Yana Paskova via Getty Images",News,22-Jan-17
 House Republicans Begin Process To Withdraw America From The United Nations,"Since 1945, the United States has been a crucial member of the United Nations, and a leader on the world stage. If Republicans have their way, however, that will end.Republicans in Congress have been whining about the United Nations for decades, and now that Donald Trump has taken over the White House, they are starting the process to force American withdrawal from the peacekeeping organization.Why?Because Trump and Republicans are mad that the United Nations condemned Israel for building illegal settlements on Palestinian land. In other words, Republicans are whining because they think the United Nations works for the United States instead of the entire world. Just as Trump thinks everything is about him, Republicans think international relations should be all about the United States.So, GOP Rep. Michael Rogers has filed The American Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2017 to formally withdraw the United States from the United Nations, which would effectively create a power vacuum within the international body that the Russians and Chinese will seek to fill.Without American influence, which we have had since the organization s founding, we will be left behind as the world moves on without us. Either that, or international cooperation will collapse entirely and throw the world into chaos as nations follow the United States and adopt isolationist policies that will ultimately lead to global wars. The United Nations was created to prevent such large scale conflicts in the first place, which is why we have avoided a World War III.The bill specifically directs Trump to  terminate all membership by the United States in the United Nations, and in any organ, specialized agency, commission, or other formally affiliated body of the United Nations. And that means the United States would also be withdrawing from the World Bank, the International Court of Justice, the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the International Atomic Energy Agency, among many others.Not only would America be going it alone, withdrawal would affect our ability to keep wannabe nuclear powers like Iran in check without starting a war. Our withdrawal from international financial institutions could have a devastating effect on the world economy, including our own.The United Nations would also have to move headquarters out of the United States, which would be a humiliating loss of international prestige.For decades, the world has looked to the United States for leadership and cooperation. But Republicans apparently want America to withdraw from the world stage   a move that would erase all the progress made over the last seven decades, and tarnish our reputation forever.This cannot be allowed to happen. This country has worked too hard to bring democracy and peace to the world to quit now. We should be leaders on the world stage, not isolationists.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,22-Jan-17
 Caroline Kennedy Is Eyeing A White House Bid,"Caroline Kennedy, daughter of President John F. Kennedy, has left her post as Ambassador to Japan. After being forced out by the incoming Trump Administration (with no replacement) Kennedy is returning back to civilian life in New York.According to the New York Post, Kennedy is eyeing a potential Senate bid in New York for 2018, in which she would face popular incumbent Kirsten Gillibrand and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney.But the sources from the Post also say Kennedy s eye is going even further, which includes a White House bid in 2020. Should Trump still be in office (and seek a second term), Kennedy would be seen as a liberal alternative to the populist billionaire.According to one source, who is close to the Kennedy family and Caroline Kennedy herself: Caroline had a successful ambassadorial run in Japan and feels really very confident about putting her hat in the ring for a New York congressional or Senate seat, with even possibly bigger political objectives down the road. Another source added: Caroline is seen in some quarters as the next Hillary Clinton. She has the Kennedy name but no Clinton baggage. After serving as Ambassador for three years, Kennedy oversaw an expansion of relations between the U.S. and Japan, which included controversial stances against whaling, and ending nuclear arms expansions.During Kennedy s tenure, her office came under intense scrutiny from the Inspector General s office. The report, which was described as  damning,  alleges that Kennedy, like Hillary Clinton, used a private email server and mismanaged many aspects of her office. Kennedy has defended her use of private email, as well as her handling of the Ambassador s office.Before becoming a diplomat, Kennedy had been a steadfast advocate for many progressive issues, including her uncle Ted s  mission in life    universal healthcare. Kennedy also holds progressive views on a variety of social issues, which include supporting abortion rights and LGBT causes. She has called for reauthorizing the assault weapons ban, and says NAFTA needs to be re-examined. One issue that bogged Clinton down in the primary was her initial support for the Iraq War, but Kennedy claims to have opposed it from the beginning.While Kennedy has the money (her net worth lies between $80 million and $500 million), the name recognition, and the support to run, nothing has been set in stone. Everything is speculative.Aside from Senator Cory Booker, Kennedy has become the first rumored potential candidate for the 2020 election season.Featured image via Slaven Vlasic via Getty Images",News,22-Jan-17
 Crowd Scientists Have BAD News For Trump Over Inauguration Crowd Size Vs. Women’s March,"Team Trump is having a war on math. Alleged president Donald Trump spoke at CIA headquarters and literally lied to the U.S. Intelligence agency about his Inaugural crowd size. He said he  looked out, the field was, it looked like a million, million and a half people.  White House Press secretary Sean Spicer said,  This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period.  Kellyanne Conway defended Spicer by saying he was presenting  alternate facts. Well, we have some bad news for Donald. Previously, it was estimated that the historic Women s March on Washington had twice the crowd size of Trump s big event. Crowd experts looked into that and the numbers are not in Donald s favor. It s worse than what was previously reported.Crowd scientists Marcel Altenburg and Keith Still of Manchester Metropolitan University in Britain shared their estimations with the New York Times.Professor Still was a crowd safety consultant for the 2011 royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, and has advised the Saudi government on crowds for the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.Nearly 3 million around the world gathered for marches on Saturday. In Los Angeles, 85,000 people were expected to protest but 750,000 showed up to march.The previous analysis was limited in scope because there wasn t any footage of a larger area available yet. As per the analysis, about three times the amount of people attended the Women s Watch than those who attended Donald s inauguration.The Hill reports:Estimates by crowd scientists shows at least 470,000 people were in Washington, D.C., near the National Mall at 2 p.m. Saturday. At Trump s inauguration, there were about 160,000 people in the same area The Washington, D.C. metro reported that Saturday was its second-busiest day in the city s history, with more than 1 million trips taken on the metro. The busiest day ever was former President Barack Obama s Inauguration Day in 2009. On Trump s Inauguration Day on Friday, about 570,000 trips were taken on the metro.On top of that, Donald s inauguration was met with a crowd about one third the size of President Obama s inauguration in 2009, according to the crowd scientists.Three million women, men and children attended the marches across America. By the way, that s almost the amount Donald lost the popular vote by to Hillary Clinton. In response to the number of protesters, Donald asked  why they didn t vote.  But we did vote, and he lost by three million.Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,22-Jan-17
 ‘Not-Racist’ Trump Fan Goes On Hours-Long Twitter Rant About ‘Nigs’ And ‘Obamaphones’ (TWEETS),"If you ever need to know exactly how divisive Donald Trump has been, if you ever need a perfect example, you don t need to look much further than Donald Trump s Twitter timeline.

 WATCH: Fox Host Chris Wallace HUMILIATES Trump’s Chief Of Staff For Lying About Inauguration Crowd Size,"Even Fox News knows that Donald Trump and his administration are making false claims about the size of the audience at the inauguration.During a press briefing on Saturday, Trump s White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer whined about media coverage of the inauguration, claiming that they lied about the crowd size. Yesterday, at a time when our nation and the world was watching the peaceful transition of power and, as the President said, the transition and the balance of power from Washington to the citizens of the United States, some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting,  Spicer began.He proceeded to make all sorts of claims that have since been shot down one by one, especially since aerial photographs taken at the time of Trump s inaugural address clearly show that he did not draw even half the crowd size President Obama drew in 2009. This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period,  Spicer said, claiming that the National Mall was packed from the Capitol to the Washington Monument.For the record, here s a time-stamped image of Trump s inauguration swearing-in ceremony AFTER it began compared to President Obama s in 2009 via PBS.And it s the aerial photographic evidence that Fox News host Chris Wallace hit Trump Chief of Staff Reince Priebus with during an interview on Sunday about Spicer and Trump s claims.First, Wallace wondered how Trump can say he is focused on helping all Americans when he is obsessed with crowd size. President Trump said in his inaugural address that every decision he makes will be to benefit American families. How does arguing about crowd size do that?  Wallace asked.Priebus claimed that Trump cares about  honesty in the media  and said the administration won t stand for false reporting. But the media accurately reported on Trump s inauguration crowd size and Wallace grilled Priebus for claiming otherwise.Wallace showed Priebus an aerial image of Trump s crowd on the National Mall and it doesn t even come close to matching Trump s claims. I think this is a ridiculous conversation,  Wallace told Priebus after viewing the photo.  There were huge areas, he said there were crowds all the way to the Washington Monument. Except the photos of the event clearly show that Trump s crowd was incredibly sparse and did not stretch near as far as he says it did.But Priebus continued to whine about the photo and claimed that it was taken before the ceremony began. However, the picture provided above was taken more than 15 minutes AFTER the ceremony began and it clearly shows that Trump s inauguration crowd size was pathetic, especially when one compares it to President Obama s in 2009.Wallace even showed Priebus the photo again but he continued to recognize it as the truth. I m telling you there were fewer people,  Wallace told him. Wallace would know because he was there.But then Priebus complained that the media is ignoring the substance of Trump s administration, to which Wallace replied by reminding Priebus that Trump has the chance to make the press briefing all about substance but chose instead to have Spicer complain about reports of the inauguration crowd size.Here s the video via YouTube:When even Fox News is calling out a Republican administration for lying, that s REALLY bad.Featured image via screenshot",News,22-Jan-17
 Trump Brags About His Inauguration’s TV Ratings And Gets A BRUTAL Reality Check,"Donald Trump s inauguration was one of the most disappointing in American history, but he keeps desperately trying to sell it as one of the best.Actual attendance at Trump s inauguration didn t even get close to a million people as aerial photos show that much of the National Mall was empty by the time Trump delivered his divisive and negative inaugural address.Neilson television ratings for Trump s inauguration were not much better as 31 million tuned in to watch a national tragedy unfold before their eyes.But Trump is bragging about this number on Twitter and comparing it to President Obama s second inauguration ratings as if he thinks he deserves some sort of prize for cherry-picking an inauguration that got lower ratings.Wow, television ratings just out: 31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2017The problem is that Trump deliberately chose to compare his inauguration to President Obama s second inauguration because his numbers were far lower than Obama s first inauguration.

 Trump Demands To Know Why The Millions Of Women Protesting Him ‘Didn’t Vote’ And Gets TRASHED (TWEETS),"On Sunday morning, Donald Trump took to Twitter to whine about crowd sizes and brag about his ratings because he s Donald Trump and let s face it   did you really expect him to worry about little things like running the country now that he s President?

He is sitting in the Oval Office solely thanks to an archaic system that was set up to protect southern states  right to own black people   an idea that is quite fine with his racist and horrible supporters. Naturally, the Internet reminded him that the majority still hates him, and no amount of whining will change that:.@realDonaldTrump they did. That's why you lost the popular vote.

 WATCH: Chuck Todd SWATS Annoying Kellyanne Conway For Calling Trump’s Lies ‘Alternative Facts’,"Kellyanne Conway tried to spin White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer s lies as  alternative facts  and got her ass handed to her by Chuck Todd.The impromptu press briefing came two hours after Trump whined about media estimates of the inauguration crowd size during a visit at the CIA.Spicer lashed out at the media in an embarrassing display of how Trump apparently intends to use press briefings over the next four years. Yesterday, at a time when our nation and the world was watching the peaceful transition of power and, as the President said, the transition and the balance of power from Washington to the citizens of the United States, some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting,  Spicer claimed.He then argued at length that  This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration   period   both in person and around the globe. Both claims are blatantly false as aerial photographs taken at the time of the inaugural address show that Trump s crowd was significantly smaller than both of President Obama s inaugurations in 2009 and 2013. Trump also only drew 31 million viewers on television, which is 7 million less than President Obama drew in 2009.Spicer also tried to blame the count on the Secret Service, but even they refuted Spicer s claim that  magnetometers  prevented people from filling the National Mall.Overall, Spicer s attack on the media for accurately reporting on the size of the inauguration crowd was petty and a complete pile of bullshit.But Kellyanne Conway defended Spicer s lies on Sunday during an interview on Meet The Press.Conway began by once again bragging about the election results, which happened nearly three months ago, in response to Todd asking why Trump would send Spicer out to  utter a provable falsehood. Conway played the victim and then threatened Todd for asking questions she doesn t like. And then she said this: Don t be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck. They re saying it s a falsehood and our press secretary, Sean Spicer, gave alternative facts to that. Yes, Conway literally called the lies that Trump ordered Spicer to spew  alternative facts,  and Todd proceeded to hammer Conway for it. Wait a minute. Alternative facts! Four of the five facts that he uttered were just not true. Alternative facts are not facts, they re falsehoods. You sent the press secretary out there to utter a falsehood on the smallest, pettiest thing. And I don t understand why you did it. Conway then played the victim again and told Todd that the media can t prove that Spicer s numbers are wrong. I don t think you can prove those numbers one way or the other. You can laugh at me all you want. You are, and I think it s actually symbolic of the way we re treated by the press. I ll just ignore it. I m bigger than that. I m a kind and gracious person. Here s the video via NBC.But the media has already proven Spicer s claims wrong. Again, we have time-stamped aerial photographs that prove Trump s crowd size was sparse. In fact, at most, Trump drew 750,000, which is smaller than numbers drawn by President Obama in 2009 and 2013.Even PolitiFact rated Spicer s temper tantrum as  pants on fire. Spicer said,  That was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period. To support his claim, Spicer offered a few pieces of misleading or inaccurate evidence.He said that floor coverings highlighting empty spaces on the National Mall were not used for previous inaugurations, but these were in place for Obama s 2013 inauguration.He claimed metro ridership was higher for Trump s inaugural than for Obama s 2013 inaugural, but he compared numbers for the morning of Obama s inaugural to the whole day for Trump s.Spicer suggested 720,000 attended Trump s inauguration, while organizers said they expected 700,000 to 900,000, and Trump himself estimated 1.5 million. All of those figures are less than the 1.8 million people who attended Obama s 2009 inaugural.We rate Spicer s claim Pants on Fire.Featured image via screenshot",News,22-Jan-17
 Women’s March Now One Of The Most Peaceful Demonstrations In American History,"The numbers are in, and over 3 million men and women of all backgrounds took to the streets all across the nation to protest Donald Trump and his incoming disastrous presidency.In 670 cities throughout the north, south, east and west   in some of the most conservative enclaves like Lubbock, Texas  protestors partook in peaceful demonstrations, and their decorum shined bright.Not one person was arrested, and not incident of violence surfaced.In Washington D.C, over 500,000 men and women gathered on the National Mall, and not one violent act sullied the day, and no arrests made for any reason.In Los Angeles, 750,000 convened (even though police only prepared for 80,000), and like Washington, not one arrest was made and not one incident of violence occurred.In New York City, 400,000 people convened, and not one was arrested.Not only were the demonstrations peaceful and orderly, police officers were deeply involved with the community, expressing solidarity with men and women:DC cops posted across from White House are wearing pink pussyhats and posing for photos with marchers. Big cheers from crowd. #WomensMarch pic.twitter.com/BCP6DO2lQp  Benjamin Freed (@brfreed) January 21, 2017In Atlanta, police officers showed their solidarity with protestors:Cops high-fived marchers as they took to the streets of Atlanta today in solidarity with the #WomensMarch: pic.twitter.com/88nZY7XpKp  WSB-TV (@wsbtv) January 22, 2017Police were respected, protestors were respected, no one got hurt, and a big message was delivered to the President of the United States. How amazing it is to see women, people of color, police and partisans alike come together for one common mission. With the next four years hanging over our heads, more instances like this will be crucial to taking back power in Washington and the state legislatures.To think that a demonstration organized by POC yielded the most peaceful of marches really puts a dent in the media (and the Trump Administration s) perception of minorities and those who protest.To paraphrase one attendee, it was a sea of humanism.The Women s March was, arguably, the largest and most peaceful demonstration in American history. The women of America (once again) showed their strength, and they should be so proud.While punches were thrown at Trump s rallies, hugs and high fives were given at the Women s March. Let that sink in.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,22-Jan-17
 Alec Baldwin Beat Sean Spicer Over The Head With Sean Hannity AND Gave Us Hope In One Epic Tweetstorm (TWEETS),"Sean Spicer got off to a bit of a rocky start as White House press secretary on Saturday when he embarrassed himself, his President, his country, and pretty much anyone who has so much as heard of the United States, with his trainwreck of a press briefing. Spicer chose to kick off his new, exciting, and likely short career by focusing on the issues that matter the most   like Trump s crowd size.Despite a turnout that was dwarfed many times over by a stampede of Nasty Women descending on Washington D.C. to tell Trump to go f*ck himself, Spicer claimed that This was the largest audience to witness an inauguration. Period!  This was, of course, a gigantic lie. According to Spicer, the crowd only looked small because they used  floor coverings  to protect the grass and this somehow transformed a large percentage of the crowd into vampires who were unable to be captured by a single recording device (though we suppose that white area could have been the tops of Trump fans  hoods creating the illusion of an empty space).Alec Baldwin may not have reprised his role as The Donald this week, much to the dismay of an eager populace, but he did stop by Twitter to have some fun with Spicer, delivering a kick to Sean Hannity s deploraballs for good measure.Sean Spicer reminds me of Sean Hannity: another hopped up, no talent white boy who thinks he's right and clever. Both are neither.  ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 22, 2017Baldwin also dropped an important message of hope on Americans, reminding us that the rallies, the marches, the protests, and everything else that causes Donald Trump to cry himself to sleep at night are a good start, but it is up to each and every one of us to keep hope alive because eventually this nightmare will be over and we will work to fix whatever damage he is able to do together.1- All of today's rallies, marches, protests are a beginning. The great responsibility now is to keep those fires burning.

ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) January 22, 2017Baldwin is right. Saturday, we saw one of the largest civil rights marches in history. The marches need to get bigger, the message that we are not going to tolerate his brand of hatred must get louder, and we as Americans   a nation of people who were forged from and tempered by adversity   need to stand together against anything he throws at us.Featured image via screengrab",News,22-Jan-17
 Trump Gets STEAMROLLED By Ex-CIA Chief For Using CIA Speech To Stroke His Own Ego,"Just as his press secretary, Sean Spicer, made a complete idiot of himself stroking Trump s ego and blasting a flabbergasted White House press corps, Trump himself made a complete idiot of himself addressing the CIA today. Except in Trump s case, he wasn t just dumb, he was offensive. And former CIA chief John Brennan had something to say about it.Standing in front of the CIA s Memorial Wall, Trump whined and cried that the media was lying about his numbers at the inauguration, claiming that there had to have been at least 1.5 million people there. He devoted just a couple of minutes of the entire speech to actually talking to the CIA. In response to that, Brennan said, according to his former chief of staff, Nick Shapiro: Former CIA director Brennan is deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump s despicable display of self-aggrandizement in front of CIA s Memorial Wall of Agency heroes. Brennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself. Brennan wasn t alone in this. Another former CIA official said he was embarrassed by Trump s  free-wheeling, narcissistic diatribe.  Yet another said,  Not quite a  this is hallowed ground moment. Former CIA Director Mike Hayden, who is Republican but stood against Trump, actually took a hell of a dig at him for it: I was heartened that the President gave a speech at CIA. It would have been even better if more of it had been about CIA.  [emphasis mine]A DNC senior adviser, Zac Petkanas, issued a blistering statement, too: After he finished ranting about crowd sizes on the National Mall, I hope President Trump sat down for an interview with the CIA to help with their investigation into his team s possible collusion with the Kremlin to win the election. Next, he can sit down with the FBI who have sought warrants to monitor his team for the same reason. For his part, Trump had to drop this piece of insanity into his speech: And I know maybe sometimes you haven t gotten the backing that you ve wanted, and you re going to get so much backing. Maybe you re going to say, please don t give us so much backing. Lords, gods and minor deities, really? That s reminiscent of when he said we were going to start winning so much that we d get tired of it.At least he didn t ask them to raise their hands if they voted for him.We all know Trump has no shame. He loves to lie and he s got his staff lying their asses off for him, too. But this disrespectful display is over the top for a man occupying the highest office in the U.S.Worse, he was greeted by cheering CIA officers when he arrived there, and he proceeded to talk all about himself. That wall, with 117 stars representing agents who have died in the line of duty, is a sacred place. Trump desecrated it with his childish egotism and accusations of lies. Most presidents who speak there choose their words and tones very carefully out of respect for fallen agents and the families they ve left behind.But not Trump! Trump has to make everything all about himself. He deserves to be blasted for it.Photo of John Brennan by Evy Mages/Getty Images, photo of Donald Trump by Olivier Doulier   Pool/Getty Images",News,22-Jan-17
 Saturday Night Live’s Post-Inauguration Opener Was Exactly The Laugh We Needed (VIDEO),"On Friday, Donald Trump   the guy who can t be trusted with a Twitter account   was handed the launch codes to our nuclear weapons and the power to destroy lives. Shortly after our nation handed him the keys to the car, he slammed on the gas and began heading for the cliff s edge, signing an executive order aimed at destroying President Obama s signature healthcare law and removing all mention of civil rights, climate change, and many other topics Republicans conveniently love to ignore as they pursue their ultimate goal of getting rid of all those goddamn brown-skinned people they think are ruining the country. In short, you need a laugh.Fortunately, Saturday Night Live came through for us with a hilarious address to the nation   not from Trump, but from the real winner of the election, Vladimir Putin. Donald, let s talk as friends. You re not off to a great start, man. I thought you d be better at this. However, I m glad to see so many people showed up at your inauguration,  Beck Bennett s Putin said as an image of the Women s March on Washington appeared onscreen. Oh wait, that s the women s march. Here is inauguration.  The image changed to one of The Donald s pathetic Friday crowd.Comparing the crowds at Donald Trump s and Barack Obama s inaugurations https://t.co/U4dIVzCKbH pic.twitter.com/zf8hxVDMpO  The New York Times (@nytimes) January 20, 2017 Today, you went to the CIA and said 1 million people came to see you in Washington, D.C.? If you re going to lie, don t make it so obvious. Say you are friends with Lebron James, not that you are Lebron James,  Putin quipped.Trump and his team spent Saturday making excuses for the terrible crowd. At first, supporters said that people skipped because of rain. This swiftly shifted to the excuse that they all have jobs and needed to go to work. Ultimately, Sean Spicer used his first press conference to inform everyone that it was actually the biggest crowd to ever appear, ever, and that  floor mats  were to blame for hiding all the people. Trump, of course, falsely claimed that one million people showed up   a clear sign that he can never measure up to Obama, for whom 1.8 million people came out from under the floor mats when he was first elected, even in The Donald s fantasies.The next four years will be a complete sh*tshow, but at least we have SNL   at least until Trump follows in his puppetmaster s footsteps and starts killing his critics.Watch the opener below:Featured image via screengrab",News,22-Jan-17
" Republicans Are Bragging That Trump’s Inauguration Broke A Record; No, Not That Record","We ll likely never know exactly how many people attended Donald Trump s inauguration, but despite his claims, the crowd size was much smaller than either of President Obama s inaugurations and much smaller than the Women s March on Washington in protest of Trump.Still, despite a roster of d-list entertainment and too little fanfare, Republicans have to brag that Trump set records, any record, so they found one. According to McClatchy, Trump set the record for numbers of prayers in his inauguration.While for most Americans, that statistic might elicit, at best, a yawn, Sarah Palin (yes, she has a blog now) was the one who jumped on it most enthusiastically, with this clickbait headline:Donald Trump was inaugurated yesterday as America s 45th President yesterday.In the midst of the ceremonies, he set a record and a surprising one, at that.President Trump set the record for the most prayers ever said during an inaugural ceremony.While not as clickbaitey, that non-record record was covered by The Kansas City Star and conservative blogs like Townhall.We weren t the only people noticing the desperation in this story:@kberntson2 @SarahPalinUSA What kind of devout Christian assaults women and stiffs people who work for him? Your kind of Christian? Ugh!!!!!  Judy Cox (@jccox722) January 21, 2017@SarahPalinUSA Also, consider a lot of the praying was people going  Please don t let Trump fuck up the country too badly.

Kay Look (@KayLook5) January 21, 2017@SarahPalinUSA who gives a shit?  John Sanity (@JohnSanityUSA) January 21, 2017. @SarahPalinUSA I m sure he had to resort to prayer since he also broke the record for the lowest attendance & approval ratings ever.  Mayra Martinez (@MayraMM) January 21, 2017If the implication is that starting an administration is somehow a sign of character, note that the previous prayer record was set by Richard M. Nixon. Of course, Trump has already bypassed Nixon s level of corruption and lies. Many say the country needs the prayers, but the country needs action. Perhaps Trump can set another record for shortest time before impeachment.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,21-Jan-17
 Trump Said The Media Lied About His PATHETIC Inauguration Crowds. CNN’s Response Is PERFECT (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is absolutely LIVID that the crowd for his presidential inauguration crowd yesterday was so pathetic and small (like his hands) in comparison to the massive turnout for former President Barack Obama s two inaugurations.He started throwing a temper tantrum yesterday, and it s continued into today as the Women s March On Washington drew massive support from around the world, making history as the largest, most widespread protest against a President.The resistance to his presidency has bothered Trump so much that he went off on the media in a speech at the CIA, claiming that the media has been lying about his shamefully low attendance numbers. Despite the fact that many Americans witnessed just how any empty the inauguration was through live footage, Trump is still trying to convince everyone that the media is dishonest. He s gotten so desperate for approval and attention that he actually put photos of the  crowd  (comprised mostly of his own VIPs) in the White House press briefing room in a sorry attempt to show that people actually attended his big day. However, one of Trump s main targets in the press has just hit back.CNN, a network that Trump has called  fake news , ran a segment on Trump s ridiculous claims by talking about Trump s CIA speech. Jim Acosta, a CNN reporter that Trump had attacked recently, explained Trump s numerous comments to his colleague, Jake Tapper. After the long list of childish remarks and behavior was finished, Tapper couldn t have been more hysterical as he completely deadpanned and said: I can t think of anything more important to the American people. The moment was so awkward and perfect, that CNN closed the topic completely   and that s what hurts Trump the most. Nothing makes him more upset than when attention is taken away from him. You can watch this moment below:Featured image via screenshots",News,21-Jan-17
 Trump Press Sec. Claims Inaugural Numbers Were Biggest EVER – Gets RIPPED APART (VIDEO),"Trump s press secretary, Sean Spicer, has wasted no time in letting the media know that reporting anything making Trump look less-than totally awesome will not be tolerated. He took to the White House press room earlier today to scold the press for daring to compare Trump s inaugural numbers to Obama s, when clearly, Trump s numbers were the biggest in history.Yes, he said that. If you re laughing too hard to continue reading at the moment, believe us, we understand fully. Transcribing Spicer s comments was unusually difficult for that very reason.It s just beyond absurd: This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration PERIOD, both in person and around the globe. Even The New York Times printed a photograph showing a misrepresentation of the crowd in the original tweet in their paper, which showed the full extent of the support depth and crowd and inse that existed. These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong. What. Just what? The biggest audience to witness an inauguration ever?

From 4th Street to the media tent holds about 220,000, and the media tent to the Washington monument another 250,000 people. Yeah, that s still not one million people, let alone 1.8 million, Mr. Spicer. No wonder all of Twitter is on your back.

" Trump Whines About The Size Of His Inauguration Crowd, Threatens Media For Reporting Accurate Numbers","Rather than do the damn job he swore to do, Donald Trump is now obsessed with complaining about media estimates of his inauguration crowd size.Trump had predicted that his inauguration would draw a record-breaking crowd. To break the record, which is held by President Obama in 2008, Trump would have had to get over 1.8 million people to show up.But he didn t even get half a million as aerial photographs and reports from the DC Metro show that Trump s audience left a hell of a lot of empty space in the National Mall.During a visit to the CIA, Trump complained about the media reports and claimed that his crowd numbered at least 1.5 million. We had a massive field of people. You saw that. Packed,  Trump claimed.  I get up this morning and I turn on one of the networks and they show an empty field. I said,  Wait a minute, I made a speech.  I looked out. The field was it looked like a million, a million and a half people,  Trump said.  They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. They said,  Donald Trump did not draw well.  It looked honestly like a million and a half people, whatever it was, it was, but it went all the way back to the Washington Monument and I turn on, by mistake, I get this network, and it showed an empty field. Said we drew 250,000 people. Now, that s not bad. But it s a lie. We had 250,000 people in the little ball that we constructed. Trump then insisted that the entire National Mall was packed all the way to the Washington Monument and then warned the media that they will  pay a price  for accurately reporting the numbers.Here s the video via Twitter:President Trump on crowd size at inauguration:  It looked like a million and a half people.  https://t.co/U5pWhBBMzt https://t.co/NX6vI6UTHR  CNN (@CNN) January 21, 2017Yes, up near the Capitol where Trump spoke was clearly packed, but the National Mall definitely was not.In fact, we can compare Trump s inauguration attendance to President Obama s in 2009 with photographs taken at the same time just before the inaugural address was delivered.For those saying  Trump can t be that hated, look at the size of the crowd    #Inauguration pic.twitter.com/Sczp6Feta5  Stefan Kay (@5tefanK) January 20, 2017What is shown is that President Obama s crowd reaches all the way to the Washington Monument in the photo on the left, while Trump s crowd is, indeed, sparse and does NOT reach the Washington Monument as he claims.Apparently, Trump is thinking of President Obama s inauguration crowd instead of his own.And the DC Metro statistics corroborate the photos.Metro Ridership: As of 11am, 193k trips taken so far today. (11am 1/20/13 = 317k, 11am 1/20/09 = 513k, 11am 1/20/05 = 197k) #wmata  Metro (@wmata) January 20, 2017The fact is that simply by looking at the photo it is possible to estimate the crowd size, and Trump s claim just doesn t match up with reality.Furthermore, it s incredibly disturbing that Trump continues to threaten the media for telling the truth about him, especially when there is photographic evidence that proves him wrong.Trump owes the media a public apology and then he needs to focus on the presidency instead of engaging in petty feuds with the free press.He s just mad because the size of the Women s March in Washington dwarfs his crowd size.Featured image via screenshot",News,21-Jan-17
 White House Officials Admit That Trump LIED About Writing His Own Inaugural Address,"Donald Trump has been bragging about his inaugural address all week, and even claimed that he wrote it himself. Today, Trump s own White House admitted he lied.Earlier this week, Trump posted a staged photo of himself with pen and paper in hand  writing  the divisive and negative inaugural address that is now known as the worst in American history.Writing my inaugural address at the Winter White House, Mar-a-Lago, three weeks ago. Looking forward to Friday. #Inauguration pic.twitter.com/S701FdTCQu  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017And CNN reported that  Trump told guests at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, as well as presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, that he planned to write the speech himself. Trump delivered the speech on Friday, portraying America as a post-apocalyptic wasteland, where inner cities are full of crime and criminals, and the citizenry suffers in great poverty while our military is crippled, all of which are complete lies.And now the negative reviews of Trump s speech are bruising Trump s fragile ego so much that he allowed the White House to confirm that he didn t write it himself.The blame is now on Trump s white supremacist chief adviser, Steve Bannon, and adviser Stephen Miller.According to the Wall Street Journal,Much of the speech was written by Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon, two of Mr. Trump s top advisers, a White House official said. I don t think we ve had a speech like that since Andrew Jackson came to the White House,  said Mr. Bannon, Mr. Trump s chief strategist and senior counselor.  It s got a deep, deep root of patriotism. So Trump is literally starting his presidency with a lie, which shows the country and the world what kind of a president he will be.One has to wonder if Trump actually contributed anything to that speech, or if he just let others do his job for him like he is going to do over the next four years.Let s be honest. There was nothing patriotic about that speech. It was a depressing and divisive speech that hurt America s image around the world.It was a pathetic inaugural address delivered in front of an equally pathetic inauguration audience that will go down in history as a horribly pathetic moment, which, hopefully, we can live long enough to put behind us in four years when we have a chance to oust Trump and put someone in office who will fix the disastrous mess he and the Republican Congress will cause.Featured image via Twitter",News,21-Jan-17
 Trump Delivers First Embarrassing Spelling Error Of His Presidency And Gets HUMILIATED By Twitter,"Well, no one will ever call Donald Trump the  speller-in-chief,  especially after this typo.Just a day after trashing the American public education system in his divisive and negative inaugural address, Trump took to Twitter once again on Saturday to pat himself on the back and suck up to his supporters. There was just one problem: He misspelled a word that even a fourth grader can spell.Trump quickly deleted it, but it was saved in the name of posterity via screenshot.Trump then posted his corrected version.I am honored to serve you, the great American People, as your 45th President of the United States!

Now he is doing it himself, only he s in an office higher than Secretary of State.Seriously, Trump is the f*cking president now, but he apparently still doesn t proofread his tweets before posting them.

 Donald Trump Will Throw A Hissy Fit After Reading George Will’s Review Of His Inaugural Address,"Donald Trump thinks his inaugural address was the best ever. George Will emphatically disagrees.As it became clear that Trump would be the Republican nominee last year, the longtime conservative columnist left the Republican Party in disgust.Trump, of course, lashed out by calling Will  overrated.  But Will fired back by nailing Trump s lack of intelligence.And after Will s review of Trump s speech, it looks like it s only a matter of time before Trump lashes out again.Trump delivered his inaugural address on Friday as a pathetic crowd watched and cheered after every word he uttered.Trump lied repeatedly and made promises he won t keep while portraying America as an apocalyptic wasteland where poverty and crime reign and the military is crippled. It was a divisive and negative speech that ignores all the progress America made over the last eight years after a devastating recession nearly flattened our economy.But Trump thinks his speech was great and Fox News stroked his fragile ego by agreeing with him.George Will, however, was not impressed. Twenty minutes into his presidency, Donald Trump, who is always claiming to have made, or to be about to make, astonishing history, had done so,  Will began in his column for the Washington Post.  Living down to expectations, he had delivered the most dreadful inaugural address in history. Will took on Kellyanne Conway s promise that Trump s speech would be  elegant. This is not the adjective that came to mind as he described  American carnage,  Will wrote.  That was a phrase the likes of which has never hitherto been spoken at an inauguration. Oblivious to the moment and the setting, the always remarkable Trump proved that something dystopian can be strangely exhilarating: In what should have been a civic liturgy serving national unity and confidence, he vindicated his severest critics by serving up reheated campaign rhetoric about  rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape  and an education system producing students  deprived of all knowledge.  Yes, all. But cheer up,  Will continued.  Because the carnage will vanish if we  follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.   Simple  is the right word. Indeed, Trump literally said this and tweeted it on Friday even though he doesn t obey those two rules himself.Will went on to reference Ronald Reagan s first inauguration and responded directly to Trump s declaration that  What truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people  by cleverly quoting words James Madison would use today to comment on Trump s rise to the presidency. A dependence on the people,  James Madison wrote,  is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.  He meant the checks and balances of our constitutional architecture. They are necessary because, as Madison anticipated and as the nation was reminded on Friday,  Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Mic. Dropped. And now we wait for Donald Trump s temper tantrum.Featured image via screenshot",News,21-Jan-17
 WATCH: Ashley Judd Takes Trump Down At Women’s March With Epic Poem,"The Women s March on Washington crowd blew Trump s inauguration audience out of the water on Saturday, but actress Ashley Judd delivered the kick to the balls Trump deserves.After months of being insulted on the campaign trail, hundreds of thousands of women rose up and traveled to our nation s capital to protest their attacker becoming the new president.Trump repeatedly attacked women by insulting their looks and even got caught admitting that he gropes women without their consent. Multiple women have come forward with their own stories of Trump sexually assaulting them and being a creep in general.After the Republican National Convention in July, Judd shared her own experiences of being ogled by Trump. I ve known Donald for 15, 17 years?  Judd told Jezebel. I m friends with someone who married into the family. Anyway, I would bump into him at the U.S. Open, for example, and I think I can say the amount of time he has spent looking at my chest rather than my face is proportional to his insanity and functionality. If I may, this is what it s like to talk to Donald Trump,  she continued.  He s a chest gazer, a breast gazer, let s be more specific and, referring to the person who at that time was married into the family, he just sexualized her.  Doesn t she look great? Doesn t she look ?  He s just revolting. And Judd continued blasting Trump by reading a poem written by 19-year-old Nina Donovan in response to Trump remarks about grabbing women  by the p*ssy. I am a nasty woman. Not as nasty as a man who looks like he bathes in Cheeto dust, a man whose words are a dis to America, Electoral College-sanctioned hate speech contaminating this national anthem. I m not as nasty as Confederate flags being tattooed across my city. The poem continued by slamming racism and the new slavery of the prison system before nailing Trump for pandering to neo-Nazis. I feel Hitler in these streets, Nazis renamed I am not as nasty as racism, fraud, conflict of interest, homophobia, sexual assault, transphobia, white supremacy, misogyny, ignorance, white privilege. The poem then referenced Trump s creepy obsession with his daughter Ivanka. I m not as nasty as your daughter being your favorite sex symbol, like your wet dreams infused with your own genes. Judd then concluded the poem. Our p*ssies ain t for grabbing. This p*ssy is for my pleasure and giving birth to more nasty women. Here s the video via YouTube:If Donald Trump was listening, he must be throwing a hissy fit right now.Featured image screenshot",News,21-Jan-17
 WATCH: Bill Maher Returns And Hilariously Mocks Drug Addicted Red States For Voting Trump,"Bill Maher returned from break just in time for Donald Trump s inauguration and dedicated one of his  New Rules  to the red states that have massive drug addiction problems.Maher began by telling liberals that they need to stop calling Trump supporters  rubes and simpletons,  and  feel their pain  instead.Maher even proved that Trump supporters are truly in pain because he pointed out that of the 14 states that have the highest number of painkiller prescriptions in the country, all of them voted for Trump.Trump also won 80 percent of the states that have the biggest heroin problem, including the counties Trump won in Ohio and Pennsylvania. In other words, people voted for Trump because they were on drugs and out of their f*cking minds. So lets stop calling Trump supporters idiots and fools and call them what they are: f*cking drug addicts!  Maher said.Maher then proceeded to blast conservatives for being hypocrites because they ve been labeling liberals as drug addicts for decades but they are now the ones plagued by heroin and painkillers to the point where these states literally are flipping to Republicans.Maher noted that Trump s best state was West Virginia, where people pop over 400 painkillers per person. West Virginia s mascot is a dilated pupil,  Maher quipped. Maher also pointed out that Wisconsin has been turning redder and redder since 2008 and now has a major heroin epidemic that has caused the number of drug deaths to quadruple. I never thought I would hear myself say this, but kids, don t do heroin. It s a gateway to being a Republican,  Maher continued.Maher continued by trying to teach conservatives how to deal with being high without doing crazy shit like voting for Trump.  We get high and bid a thousand bucks for a Beatles lunchbox on eBay, you got high and ordered a president from Moscow. He then concluded the segment by telling drug addled conservative to  ignore the asshole across the bar who keeps staring at you staring at you, that s a mirror.

 It’s Official: Women’s March Overtakes Inauguration Attendance,"What happens when the most vile, sexist chauvinist is elected President of the United States (after 11 women accuse him of sexual harassment)? Women take to the streets, and fight for their right to be treated like human beings.And that s exactly what happened.It s no secret: Donald Trump s inauguration had poor attendance (250,000 compared to Obama s 1.8 million). He promised that it would be a  huge  and glorious event, and it wasn t   not by a long shot.But do you want to know was a huge a glorious event?The Women s March.According to the Washington Post:Organizers, who originally sought a permit for a gathering of 200,000, said Saturday they now expect as many as a half million participants   potentially dwarfing Friday s inaugural crowd.The March is expecting up to 500,000 attendees, doubling that of the President of the United States  inauguration. A mom from Hawaii started it all on Facebook just after the election, and she has successfully beaten out the efforts of a $200 million inauguration for the leader of the free world.Say that out loud if need be.The D.C. Metro was swamped, forcing long and crowded lines that took several hours to overcome, and parking in the downtown Capitol Hill area had been full as early as 8 a.m., forcing other protestors to seek parking miles away.You didn t see any of this at Trump s inauguration.This is what happens when Republican men mess with the women of America. Ask Clarence Thomas and Todd Aiken what it s like. Now Donald Trump can be added to that good old boys club that s going to blow it for the GOP in 2018.Trump has put the Violence Against Women on the chopping block and is now being sued in court by one of his accusers, and women are more than ready to take him on full force   and this march is just the beginning.Feminist icon Gloria Steinem was amazed by the size of the crowd, saying,  This is the upside of the downside. This is an outpouring of democracy like I ve never seen in my very long life.

 Trump Thanks Fox News For Kissing His A** And Gets Appropriately HAMMERED For It,"Donald Trump s Inaugural Address received poor reviews for it s divisive and negative tone, not to mention the countless lies and promises he won t keep. But apparently, Fox News liked it that way.Trump portrayed America as a dystopian wasteland where inner cities are run by criminals, the military is crippled, and poverty is a plague across the land even though crime is down, the economy is strong with unemployment below five percent, and the military is the most funded in the world.Trump also suggested that President Obama was a tyrant who kept control of the government away from the people even though President Obama was duly elected by the people in 2008 and 2012 with a bigger popular vote and electoral vote margins than Trump received in 2016.Fox News, however, loved Trump s speech and Trump appreciated them kissing his ass so he tweeted about it on Saturday morning.A fantastic day and evening in Washington D.C.Thank you to @FoxNews and so many other news outlets for the GREAT reviews of the speech!

" Trump Just SHUT DOWN ALL Of The Department Of The Interior’s Twitter Accounts, Because Reasons","The Department of the Interior has a Twitter account just like pretty much everyone else these days, including government agencies. But it seems that those agencies aren t immune to censorship from our dear, sweet, thin-skinned, narcissistic Cheeto-in-Chief. The Department of the Interior was ordered to shut down its Twitter accounts Friday evening after the National Park Service had the gall to post two, ahem, unflattering tweets.The first has been flying around social media, and has to do with Trump s pathetically dismal crowds, particularly in comparison to Obama s crowds for both of his inaugurations:The second tweet made note of gaps in policy on the new White House website, including scrubbing the site of anything having to do with civil rights, LGBTQ rights, climate change and the ACA.Apparently, it was a Park Service employee who retweeted these things, and either Trump himself couldn t handle it and wanted to show them who s really boss now, or the Dept. of the Interior is afraid enough of Trump to not only delete those two tweets, but comply with an order to shut down their entire Twitter presence. The Washington Post got hold of the email with that order: All bureaus and the department have been directed by incoming administration to shut down Twitter platforms immediately until further notice. It would actually be understandable for them to delete the offending tweets and reprimand, reassign, or even fire the employee responsible. But to have to shut down their entire Twitter presence because of two goddamn tweets from one agency?Welcome to Trump s America.The department has dozens of official Twitter accounts across ten agencies, but that email was described as an  urgent directive  with which they had to comply.An official with knowledge of the incident sounds a bit like he s been cowed:A government official familiar with the stand-down said the agency is investigating whether the retweets were purposeful,  errant  or  whether we ve been hacked. They were not reflective of Park Service policy,  said the official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the directive. The stand-down was  precautionary  until the agency completes a review of its Twitter accounts, the official said.This is terrifying. This is dictatorial behavior, not the behavior of an incoming president who believes in democracy.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,21-Jan-17
 Donald Trump Even Stole The Cake Design From Obama’s 2013 Inauguration (TWEETS),"At this point, it s fair to ask,  What is Donald Trump s deal?  From allegedly paying Russian prostitutes to  drain the swamp  all over a bed because Obama once slept in it to stealing a photo from our last legitimate President s inauguration and attempting to pass it off as one of his own, to erasing as much of Obama s agenda as he could from the White House website, to immediately going for Obamacare s throat, it almost feels like The Donald s only purpose is to erase the President s legacy and douse it in Russian lady pee. Now, it seems, he even stole a cake design from Obama.Duff Goldman, aka the  Ace of Cakes  made a very nice cake for the inaugural celebration. According to Eater, it weighed between 40 and 50 pounds, stood about four feet tall, and featured  red velvet, lemon poppy seed, pumpkin chocolate chip and pineapple coconut flavors.  Goldman designed the cake to honor all five branches of the military by displaying each of their seals prominently on the side of the cake   basically, it s patriotic as f*ck. Here is a photo of Trump, Pence, and one of the few immigrants they like admiring the cake:WASHINGTON, DC   JANUARY 20: President Donald Trump, his wife First Lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Karen Pence clap before cutting the cake during A Salute To Our Armed Services Inaugural Ball at the National Building Museum on January 20, 2017 in Washington, DC. President Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States today. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)Here s the thing, though: Goldman didn t make that cake for Trump   he made it for Obama in 2013. Trump just stole the design. The cake on the left is the one I made for President Obama s inauguration 4 years ago,  Goldman wrote on Twitter Friday.  The one on the right is Trumps. I didn t make it.

 Trump Just Waved His Magic Wand And Made Major Information On Climate Change Disappear (IMAGES),"The White House s official website used to have lengthy pages on several topics, including climate change, the ACA, LGBTQ rights and civil rights, among other things. The instant the clock struck noon in Washington, though, Trump and his admin furiously began scrubbing the site of pretty much everything they don t like.Obama once had a very long and detailed page dedicated exclusively to fighting climate change, which is an issue that s growing in importance. 2015 was once the hottest year on record. Now 2016 is the hottest year on record. In other words, the planet is heating faster and faster, according to real science, but Trump and his administration still seem to think climate change is either a hoax, or it s a nuisance to be destroyed.Otherwise Trump wouldn t have appointed Scott Pruitt, a lying climate denier as head of the EPA, which he also happens to be suing (or was).Scientists have been scrambling to preserve as much government climate data as possible in recent weeks, downloading everything to a network of servers in Canada where Herr Trump can t touch it. And now their fears that Trump wants to squash talk of man-made climate change are starting to play out.Trump s only mention of anything having to do with the environment is his  America First Energy Plan.  That plan is committed to rolling back EPA rules and expanding fossil fuel operations because that s obviously the magic bullet we need for jobs, energy growth and the environment (the truth was spoken by a coal miner who, on Dec. 22, blasted any ideas that we can actually bring coal jobs back to coal country to smithereens).Where once there was a fount of information, a search for  climate change,   global warming,  and anything along those lines on the White House s site suddenly reveals a whole lot of nothing.  It s completely normal for whitehouse.gov to change rapidly with an incoming administration, but it doesn t appear to be customary to scrub all references to absolutely everything the incoming administration has been sneering at the whole time.Motherboard s Jason Koebler made this all the more ominous by saying: Scientists I ve spoken to who are archiving websites say they expect scientific data on the NASA, NOAA, Department of Energy, and EPA websites to be neglected or deleted eventually. They say they don t expect agency sites to be updated immediately, but expect it to play out over the course of months. This sort of low-key data destruction might not be the type of censorship people typically think about, but scientists are treating it as such. Do we really have to wonder whether Trump will try and censor all climate change information everywhere? No, we really do not.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,20-Jan-17
 Trump Immediately Erases Civil Rights And LGBT Pages On White House Website (IMAGES),"Donald Trump hasn t even been in office for a day and he is already declaring that gay people and people of color don t matter.Despite saying that he will work for all Americans during his inaugural address, his actions speak much louder than his words.As soon as he took control of the White House s website on Friday after the inauguration, Trump immediately removed pages from the  issues  section that deal with civil rights, the LGBT community, climate change, and healthcare.Here are some images grabbed by The Daily Beast.Trump replaced the Civil Rights page with a page supporting law enforcement that calls for more police officers and libels inner cities as crime-ridden and black people as criminals. In our nation s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent,  the site claims, which is a lie that the Daily Beast pointed out, saying,  homicides in Washington, D.C. were down in 2016 over 2015. Apparently, Trump s idea of civil rights for black people is hiring more racist police officers to execute them.Looking for some of these pages now redirects people to a page where Trump can send his gullible supporters bullshit propaganda.Clearly, Donald Trump intends to ignore civil rights and the LGBT community for the next four years as Republicans rush to legalize discrimination.This is especially frightening since Trump nominated the very racist Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions as his Attorney General, and has already decided to slash funding for the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department.This is how quick democracy is dying in America. Trump hasn t even been in charge for a day and he is already attacking civil rights and the LGBT community. By removing both issues from the White House website, Trump just announced that he doesn t care about either.America is under attack from within and we can t afford to wait until 2018 to do something about it.Featured image via the Daily Beast",News,20-Jan-17
 We’re Not F*cking With You: Trump Stole Part Of His First Presidential Speech From A Batman Villain (VIDEO),"If you thought it was hilarious that Trump s 2020 slogan was directly lifted from a promotional poster for  The Purge, you re in for a treat when you realize that he quoted a Batman villain during his first speech as President. Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another,  Trump told his tiny, tiny crowd of less than a quarter-million on Friday,  But we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.

 Trump’s First Action In Office: Hurt The Poor As Quickly As Possible,"The first thing that Donald Trump had planned on doing upon taking office was issue a bunch of executive orders canceling a bunch of executive orders. That s one promise he s making good on already, but rescinding a lot of things Obama did will harm a lot of people.During Obama s last week in office, he announced a reduction in FHA fees from .85 percent to .60 percent. That may not sound like a lot, but given that mortgages are in the hundreds of thousands, that reduction can actually provide some relief to low-income and first-time borrowers. That s what Trump has canceled.The Department of Housing and Urban Development is now under the auspices of the less-than-experienced-and-intelligent Ben Carson, who was disappointed that Obama didn t consult him about this. He was also disappointed that Obama and the FHA announced it so close to the end of his presidency.Which is, of course, ridiculous   until Obama had officially left office and Trump was officially sworn in, he could continue his work as the leader of this country. But Republicans have spent the last year acting like a president has no right to act during his entire last year of office, though, so of course Carson was upset.Republicans claim that lowering those rates will hurt taxpayers because it will hurt funding for the FHA. From the group that wants to destroy the mortgage-interest deduction homeowners claim on their taxes, though, that s rich. In reality, this is another attack on the poor and the young.It s important to note that what the FHA program does is provide insurance for mortgages, rather than doing the actual loans themselves. On a $200,000 home, the annual fee is $1,700. The reduction Obama wanted would have reduced that to $1,200. An extra $500 per year doesn t sound like much, but for both low-income and first-time homebuyers, that extra $500 can go a very long way.What does Trump and his administration care, though? Their logic very likely boils down to,  If you can t afford to buy, then just freaking rent. It s not that hard.  Well, actually, yes it is in many markets where average rents are higher than average mortgages. In fact, in August 2016, monthly rents were higher than monthly mortgage payments in markets across 42 states.Housing groups were divided on this, but many did want Obama s reduction because they believed it could have helped spur some home-buying. Without that reduction, though, there will be fewer low-income people who can afford a loan, and will have trouble affording to rent housing too. That can push them into worse areas with fewer jobs, and it s a downward spiral.Thanks, Trump.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,20-Jan-17

 Trump’s Divisive And Negative Inaugural Address Was Full Of Lies And Most Americans TRASHED It,"Donald Trump delivered his inaugural address on Friday, and it was predictably divisive and negative.Trump portrayed America as a weak, crime-ridden wasteland where everyone lives in poverty. Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.An education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. He also attacked President Obama by proclaiming that  January 20th, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again, called our military  depleted,  and railed against America s crumbling infrastructure.Of course, Trump left out the fact that Republicans blocked infrastructure spending for eight years. He also failed to point out that Republicans have been attacking education for years.Also, our military is the most funded military in the world, so claiming that it is depleted is a lie and an insult to our troops.It should be pointed out that Trump contributed to the shuttering of factories in this country by buying raw materials, like metals, from China to build his hotels with instead of buying it from American companies.Crime is also down, and millions of Americans were lifted from poverty over the last eight years because of programs like the Affordable Care Act and minimum wage hikes, both of which Trump opposes. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. Trump failed to mention that he wants to cut NASA s budget too, supports the anti-vaccination movement, intends to double down on coal and oil to the detriment of clean energy, and is eliminating a government agency dedicated to researching and developing new technologies to reduce carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.Seriously, Trump s speech was totally contradictory to what his administration actually plans to do.The inaugural address was a shit show and Americans confirmed it on Twitter.That was like a bad liberal parody of a Republican president s inaugural address.

This is not normal. Nothing about Trump s campaign, election, or presidency is normal. It is time for the American people to steel their resolve to fight against this wildly hated man, to do all they can to keep him from implementing his horrifying and dangerous agenda.The next four years will be hard, perhaps harder than any four-year period in our lifetimes, but one thing Americans have always had is the strength to stand together in times of adversity   and how much more  adverse  could things be than staring down a President who is sitting in the Oval Office thanks to a massive propaganda and fake news campaign, and hacking of his political opponents spearheaded by a hostile foreign dictator?Featured image via screen capture ",News,20-Jan-17
 WOW: Intercepted Communications Implicate Three Top Trump Advisors In Plot With Russia,"By now, you have probably heard that the FBI and five other intelligence agencies have, for months, been investigating ties between many of Trump s top-level people and Russia. On Thursday, The New York Times told us who it is:The counterintelligence investigation centers at least in part on the business dealings that some of the president-elect s past and present advisers have had with Russia. Mr. Manafort has done business in Ukraine and Russia. Some of his contacts there were under surveillance by the National Security Agency for suspected links to Russia s Federal Security Service, one of the officials said.Mr. Manafort is among at least three Trump campaign advisers whose possible links to Russia are under scrutiny. Two others are Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign, and Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative.The F.B.I. is leading the investigations, aided by the National Security Agency, the C.I.A. and the Treasury Department s financial crimes unit. The investigators have accelerated their efforts in recent weeks but have found no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing, the officials said. One official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House.Counterintelligence investigations examine the connections between American citizens and foreign governments. Those connections can involve efforts to steal state or corporate secrets, curry favor with American government leaders or influence policy. It is unclear which Russian officials are under investigation, or what particular conversations caught the attention of American eavesdroppers. The legal standard for opening these investigations is low, and prosecutions are rare.In short, it s unlikely that anyone will be charged, but we as Americans have every reason to be concerned with the people with whom Trump surrounds himself. Manafort, naturally, calls the allegations a Democrat Party dirty trick and completely false. I have never had any relationship with the Russian government or any Russian officials. I was never in contact with anyone, or directed anyone to be in contact with anyone,  he adds. On the  Russian hacking of the D.N.C.,  my only knowledge of it is what I have read in the papers.  Politifact confirmed last year that Manafort has many relationships with pro-Putin politicians in Ukraine at minimum.While Trump will attempt to connect this to the 35-page  pee pee dossier  published by Buzzfeed   the one handed to Trump and Obama by intelligence agencies   the FBI says that the decision to open the investigation was not based on those in the least:The F.B.I. investigation into Mr. Manafort began last spring, and was an outgrowth of a criminal investigation into his work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and for the country s former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. In August, The Times reported that Mr. Manafort s name had surfaced in a secret ledger that showed he had been paid millions in undisclosed cash payments. The Associated Press has reported that his work for Ukraine included a secret lobbying effort in Washington aimed at influencing American news organizations and government officials.Mr. Stone, a longtime friend of Mr. Trump s, said in a speech in Florida last summer that he had communicated with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group that published the hacked Democratic emails. During the speech, Mr. Stone predicted further leaks of documents, a prediction that came true within weeks.In a brief interview on Thursday, Mr. Stone said he had never visited Russia and had no Russian clients. He said that he had worked in Ukraine for a pro-Western party, but that any assertion that he had ties to Russian intelligence was  nonsense  and  totally false. The whole thing is a canard,  he said.  I have no Russian influences. The Senate intelligence committee has started its own investigation into Russia s purported attempts to disrupt the election. The committee s inquiry is broad, and will include an examination of Russian hacking and possible ties between people associated with Mr. Trump s campaign and Russia.Investigators are also scrutinizing people on the periphery of Mr. Trump s campaign, such as Mr. Page, a former Merrill Lynch banker who founded Global Energy Capital, an investment firm in New York that has done business with Russia.In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Page expressed bewilderment about why he might be under investigation. He blamed a smear campaign   that he said was orchestrated by Mrs. Clinton   for media speculation about the nature of his ties to Russia. I did nothing wrong, for the 5,000th time,  he said. His adversaries, he added, are  pulling a page out of the Watergate playbook. What further details will the investigation reveal? Only time will tell   but Donald Trump is now our President, and his cozy relationship with Vladimir Putin is terrifyingly clear. All you have to do is look at his Twitter account.Featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla/Win McNamee/Spencer Platt)",News,20-Jan-17
 Bush Speechwriter LEVELS Trump With This Devastating Inauguration Day Tweet,"Donald Trump officially and depressingly takes over the White House today, but former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum had some strong words for him on this Inauguration Day.Of course, Trump won t bother actually going on the job until Monday since he has decided to take a two day vacation first.So he ll have plenty of time to read a tweet Frum posted on Twitter and throw a temper tantrum about it.Frum called Trump the  worst human being  who has ever become president, and that includes every president who owned slaves.The worst human being ever to enter the presidency, and I include all the slaveholders.  David Frum (@davidfrum) January 20, 2017No doubt, if slavery still existed Donald Trump would definitely be a slaveholder. Hell, he has his company s products made by cheap labor overseas. Slaves would have to manufacture his products for free and we all know Trump would love that. In fact, 20 percent of Trump supporters actually believe that freeing the slaves was a bad idea. And let s not forget that white supremacist flocked to support Trump s campaign and Trump even made of them his top adviser.Frum then followed up with a tweet about how much of a coward Trump is.Andrew Jackson was at least physically brave  David Frum (@davidfrum) January 20, 2017Indeed, Andrew Jackson fought duels and was a soldier for this country. Trump, on the other hand, dodged the draft during Vietnam and only brags that he could kill someone.Donald Trump only fights for Donald Trump. He doesn t care about this nation and he intends to destroy everything that made this country great.Americans across the country should be terrified. The days of hope and change are gone. Republicans are going to double down on their failed policies like never before and our country will pay a steep price for it.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,20-Jan-17

" Alec Baldwin Joins Anti-Trump Protest, Gives Speech That Will RUIN Trump’s Inauguration Day (VIDEO)","Over the next few days, America (and the world, for that matter) will be protesting the presidency of Donald Trump and his dangerous administration.The protests had already begun yesterday, the day before Trump officially would be sworn in. Last night in New York City, several celebrities also joined the anti-Trump protests   and one of them included actor Alec Baldwin, who gets under Trump s skin like no one else can.To make sure that he would piss Trump off to the fullest extent, Baldwin gave a speech and even made sure he did his Trump impersonation from SNL, which never fails to make Trump have a Twitter meltdown. Channeling Trump, Baldwin mocked the former reality television star and reminded Americans that the next President of the United States has a worrisome relationship with Russia: I just want to say,  I ve been standing out here in the freezing cold for a long time. I have to go to the bathroom. I have to pee. But I m holding it in, I m holding it in, I m not gonna pee. I m going to a function at the Russian consulate tonight, I m holding it in  till I get there. After Baldwin had his fun imitating Trump, he grew serious and made sure that Americans knew how strong they would have to be over the next four years in order to preserve America s true values. Baldwin told protesters that Trump and his cabinet members are counting on Americans to  lay down  and stop resisting, making it critical for the entire country to unite and oppose any concerning measure the administration proposes. Baldwin also said: For all of you out there who have children, they re never too young for you to teach them what a real American is  These people are a disgrace. They are a disgrace to everything you and I believe in. You can watch Baldwin s speech below:This protest was joined by several other celebrities as well. Al Sharpton, Michael Moore, Mark Ruffalo and Robert De Niro all took turns speaking against Trump. We know that when Trump sees footage of this, he won t be able to contain his anger, even on the biggest day of his life.Featured image via screenshots",News,20-Jan-17
 Protesters Just Trolled Trump’s ‘Deploraball’ SO F*cking Hard You Have To See It To Believe It (VIDEO),"Trump supporters sure were in for a surprise at the aptly-named  Deploraball  on Thursday, when protesters projected an unflattering message on the side of the National Press Club just as supporters attempted to  sieg heil  The Donald without any interruption from those who exist outside their hateful little bubble.As white supremacists, people who love white supremacists, and pro-Trump Sheriff David Clarke joined together in a diverse crowd of white people to celebrate Trump s ascension to Grand Wizard of the U.S. of A., protesters outside had a little bit of fun with technology, projecting the sort of messaging that sends their leader into an uncontrollable Twitter rage.Messages projected on the side of the building where alt-right ball is being held: ""Impeach the predatory president"" pic.twitter.com/uJiYZGgzey  Jack Smith IV (@JackSmithIV) January 20, 2017""Impeach predatory president"" projected onto National Press Club as #DeploraBall parties #DisruptJ20 pic.twitter.com/fi5As7UOLp  Alexander Rubinstein (@AlexR_DC) January 20, 2017""Impeach the predatory president"" pic.twitter.com/reYjg6DCaK  Gideon Resnick (@GideonResnick) January 20, 2017On the building: ""Impeach the predatory president."" #Inauguration pic.twitter.com/HQRWI7DZHI  Heidi Groover (@heidigroover) January 20, 2017 Resist, protect, create,  one message read. Another urged our leaders to  impeach the predatory President.  One of them, which Trump fans would describe as  crazy light pictures what has some of them words on them,  reminded everyone that Trump routinely brags about grabbing women by their genitals.During these next four years, it is important that we never allow a white supremacist party for a President who got where he by is sowing seeds of fear and spewing hate speech to become normal. Every time this sort of thing happens, it is our duty to our country to show up and denounce it. It s going to be rough for us for quite some time, but if we fight hard against the Deplorables and their sick ideology, we can ensure a brighter future for our country some time after 2020.Featured image via Twitter",News,20-Jan-17
 Trump SCRAMBLING To Fill Over 600 Empty Posts – Literally Has ONE Option Ahead Of Swearing-In,"Apparently, Trump has been unable to fill more than 600 executive posts in his administration, according to a new report from The New York Times. With Obama leaving office now, and his swearing-in ceremony looming, he only has one option left: Retain Obama s staffers, at least for the time being.That has to be galling for someone who keeps insisting he s the best at everything, has the best of everything, and has a cabinet with the highest IQ ever (don t make us laugh too hard,  sir ). He clearly isn t the best at appointing staff or working with other people. Senior Obama administration officials, along with some Republican lawmakers, have watched with growing alarm as the pace of the transition stops and starts. They ve said, repeatedly, that Trump s team won t coordinate with them.The Times says that aides released the names of over a dozen fresh appointments, but that barely scratches the surface of what they have to do. They also announced that they would keep 50 essential personnel in both the Department of State and Department of Homeland Security for the time being, including current Obama appointee Thomas A. Shannon Jr., who will stay on as acting Secretary of State pending Rex Tillerson s confirmation.Other Obama officials sticking around for now include:And White House press secretary Sean Spicer tried to spin it as  ensuring continuity of government.  Har de har har.Things are so terrible that Strobe Talbott, the president of the Brookings Institution and former Clinton official, said: In 21 years of covering the State Department and in eight years of serving there, I ve seen rocky transitions and experienced what feels like a hostile takeover, but I ve never seen anything like this. 21 years is a long time to never see anything like this.For his part, Trump really doesn t seem to care. He s floating around Washington, working to draw the crowds he so desperately needs to keep his ego properly inflated and still avoiding a lot of real work. He s acting like the demagogue he is, preparing to be crowned tomorrow, rather than sworn in. He even said it was  bad karma  to get too involved with the transition, and, according to the Times report, wanted to stop planning altogether.Besides, appointing people to his administration? That s grunt work. He s above grunt work.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",News,20-Jan-17
" Congratulations, Republicans, You Got Played","Well, here we are. The last day of eight years that is the Obama presidency. For eight years, we all saw a swarm of friends and acquaintances regurgitate the most asinine conspiracy theories about President Obama imaginable. Whether they came from Sarah Palin or Alex Jones, right-wing looney tunes were always a far cry from the truth. Today we have a new term for it: fake news. But we must always remember what it truly is: conspiracy theories.Now that the great and honorable President Obama leaves office tomorrow, let s remind the  economically anxious  red America:Congratulations on letting yourself be played for the last 8 years! It was quite a sight to behold, both sad and funny that teetered on the brink of near insanity. Hopefully, this will be a learning experience to turn off the TV, quit with the fake news, and apply some common sense, no?Considering they just elected the biggest conspiracy theorist around, one shouldn t get their hopes up.Now that Trump has already broken a slew of promises, watch as red state citizens still bitterly cling to their guns and bibles while finding a way to somehow blame Obama.It is nearly impossible to record how much money, time and brain cells Republicans lost being perpetually lied to by the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, Alex Jones, Dinesh D Souza, Bill O Reilly, Michele Bachmann and the rest of the right-wing brigade.The fact that Republicans allowed their minds to be poisoned for nine years (counting the campaign in 2008) will have long lasting effects for generations to come and will continue to throughout the Trump presidency.President Obama got one thing wrong: there is a blue state America and a red state America. But it goes so much deeper than that. There s an alert America and an easily duped America. There s a truthful America and an untruthful America. Luckily, Democrats were the former, and sadly Republicans allowed themselves to be the latter.But it wasn t always like this. In January 2009, as President Obama prepared to take office, 71 percent of America came together to support the new incumbent. Then the power of talk radio prevailed, and America was to be utterly transformed, never to be the same again.President Obama will leave office with a 60 percent approval rating. Perhaps a chunk of the GOP electorate realizes they have been manipulated.Going forward, Democrats and progressives alike need to be cautious of what they share and believe. Allowing our disdain for Trump to border on conspiracy is a dangerous route to take.Be vigilant, but be smart.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,19-Jan-17
 Trump Literally Wanted A North Korea Style Military Parade At Inauguration Including Tanks And Missile Launchers,"Donald Trump wanted to celebrate power like a dictator, but the military rejected his demands.We ve all seen how North Korea and Russia put on big flashy military parades in a desperate effort to get attention and brag about how tough they supposedly are. American presidents, however, have never really done that. Trump wanted to be the first.Apparently, Trump and his team wanted tanks and missile launchers to roll down Pennsylvania Avenue as if to threaten his critics and political opponents while trying to convince everyone that he s tough and doesn t have small hands.Thankfully, our military responsibly rejected Trump s idea in favor of giving him a rare military flyover instead.According to Huffington Post,During the preparation for Friday s transfer-of-power, a member of Trump s transition team floated the idea of including tanks and missile launchers in the inaugural parade, a source involved in inaugural planning told The Huffington Post.  They were legit thinking Red Square/North Korea-style parade,  the source said, referring to massive military parades in Moscow and Pyongyang, typically seen as an aggressive display of muscle-flexing.The military, which traditionally works closely with the presidential inaugural committee, shot down the request, the source said. Their reason was twofold. Some were concerned about the optics of having tanks and missile launchers rolling down Pennsylvania Avenue. But they also worried that the tanks, which often weigh over 100,000 pounds, would destroy the roads.20 military aircraft will fly over the Inauguration on Friday doubling as a training exercise so that Trump s ego can be stroked just enough to keep him happy.Such flyovers are rare. President Obama did not ask for one and the only president before Ronald Reagan to get one was Harry S Truman, who oversaw the end of World War II.But what Trump was asking for is literally something that dictators in North Korea and Russia do.So the fact that Trump wanted to be like Kim Jong-Un or Joseph Stalin does not help his tyrannical image at all.Here s video of a North Korean military parade via YouTube.Seriously, Trump wanted something very similar to this. Are you scared yet, America?Featured image via screenshot",News,19-Jan-17
" WATCH: Jon Voight Gives Divisive Speech At Trump Inauguration Concert, Insults Abraham Lincoln","Unable to find any A-list celebrities to headline his inauguration concert, Donald Trump turned to has-been actor Jon Voight to give a short speech and it was pathetic.As President Abraham Lincoln s statue was forced to sit and watch, Voight took to the stage to introduce Sam Moore to sing and delivered some short remarks that immediately set the Internet ablaze with fury that makes us all understand why his daughter Angelina Jolie wants nothing to do with him.Voight portrayed Trump as a victim of lies and propaganda, and then pumped out pro-Trump propaganda that included claiming that God is on Trump s side and that Lincoln is happy about Trump being in the White House. Seriously. We have all witnessed a grueling year and half for the president-elect,  Voight said. We have been witnessed to a barrage of propaganda that left us all breathless with anticipation. Not knowing if God could reverse all the negative lies against Mr. Trump whose only desire   whose only desire was to make America great again! After some more bullshit about how God answered the prayers of conservatives, Voight insulted Lincoln by invoking his name and claimed that Lincoln approves of Trump And President Lincoln, who sits here with us, I m sure is smiling knowing America will be saved by an honest and good man who will work for all the people no matter their creed of color,  Voight concluded.Here s the video via YouTube.Trump repeatedly insulted black people on the campaign trail, did not name a single Latino to his Cabinet, and only named two people who are not white men to serve in Cabinet posts.It should also be pointed out that Donald Trump had the support of white supremacists throughout his campaign and he even named one as his top adviser. If Lincoln s statue could have stood up to vomit behind the Memorial it would have done so.The Internet immediately mocked Voight for his divisive lies.Pretty sure Lincoln is not smiling, Jon Voight  Katlyn D Angelo (@KatlynDAngelo) January 20, 2017Jon Voight said  God answered our prayers  in electing Trump?It must be the same god slave owners thanked for slavery#TrumpInauguration  Yukio Strachan (@boldandworthy) January 20, 2017Sorry @jonvoight   I doubt God wants anything to do with trump.

 Here Are Five LGBTQ Protections Trump Will Have A VERY Hard Time Reversing,"One of the most devastated and vulnerable communities under a Donald Trump administration will be the LGBTQ community. The 2016 GOP platform is easily one of the most explicitly anti-LGBTQ in history. They plan to do all they can to discriminate openly, and with control of the entire federal government, they have no one to stop them.However, there are a few things that happened on President Obama s watch that the Republicans will find that their hands are tied on. Firstly, the bigots like Mike Pence and others in Trump s administration can gnash their teeth all they want, but the Supreme Court already ruled on marriage equality. It s done.The only potential caveat here is that, with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, there s a vacant seat that the GOP obstructionists refused to allow President Obama to fill, though it was rightfully his. Even so, it takes a 60-vote majority for the Senate to confirm a SCOTUS justice, and no way will the Democrats go for some right-wing, homophobic nut on that one. They could try the nuclear option, of course. To that end, let s just make sure we keep Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg in tip-top shape until we get rid of Trump, Pence, and their cabinet of horrors.Secondly, President Obama was forceful with the issue of repealing Don t Ask, Don t Tell. The United States Armed Forces now has openly LGBTQ soldiers serving in all branches, and transitions for transgender folks are covered as well. President Obama famously told his military chiefs that they could step down if they had issues with his repeal. This is a done deal, and what are they going to do, waltz in and kick all the gay soldiers out? Didn t think so. Even Pence can t be that stupid.Next is the fight for transgender rights. While a lot of the legal stuff was by executive order, and Pence will likely DEMAND that it all be undone immediately, what they cannot undo is public perception. If this extremist administration goes aggressively after transgender people   who are easily the most vulnerable in our society   they will face swift and immediate backlash. Trump is already entering office as the least popular president in modern history, with the scandal of an investigation into his ties to Russia already hanging over his head. He isn t going to want to make himself even less popular by going after a group of people whose issues are front and center for the first time in history.President Obama also made a point of appointing hordes of openly gay judges to federal judgeships. These folks will smack down anything unconstitutional done against us in the name of Trump and Pence s bigotry, and there isn t a damn thing they can do about it. Absent violating the law, federal judges stay on the bench as long as they damn well please.Lastly   but perhaps most importantly   President Obama s open support of LGBTQ people pushed our issues to the forefront and changed public perception of us. The bigoted views of the people in Trump s cabinet of extremists are far outside the mainstream. We have President Obama to thank for that. He aggressively promoted equality here at home and on the world stage. He wasn t afraid to call out the bigotry of politicians in the United States, nor those abroad. He deliberately sent gay United States delegates to Russia s Sochi Olympics, in a blatant rebuke of Vladimir Putin s campaign of hate against LGBTQ citizens. He also smacked down the Kenyan president over his country s brutal homophobia. And, in a last nod to our community, President Obama made clear his feelings on the brutal treatment of transgender prisoners by commuting Chelsea Manning s sentence on the way out the door.Thank you, President Obama, for protecting our community. Who knows where we d be without you? We re going to miss you so much.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter",News,19-Jan-17
" UNHINGED Trump Supporters Visit DC For Inauguration, Celebrate By SPITTING On Migrant Kids (TWEET)","President-elect Donald Trump set the stage for a truly hateful social and political climate when he began his presidential campaign by calling immigrants  rapists  and  drug dealers  and continuing to make moves to exclude them from the country in the following months.Trump s rabid supporters have latched onto that message and now that we are just a day away from Trump s inauguration, their vile behavior is only amplified now. Rep. Filemon Vela has just become the fourth Texas Democrat to boycott Trump s inauguration, and for good reason.Vela had originally planned to attend Trump s inauguration to provide  a moment of healing and outreach    but Trump s supporters have caused him to change his mind. In a statement posted to social media, Vela told of a disgusting interaction he d witnessed between migrant students and Trump supporters in Washington, DC for Trump s inauguration. He said: While visiting Washington, DC, 40 migrant students from my district were subjected to comments of  beaners,   burritos,  and  wetbacks  from Inauguration attendees. One student was even spit on. And that wasn t all that made Vela change his mind. He was also appalled at Trump s final cabinet selection, which conveniently left out any Hispanics. Vela continued: Then, Donald Trump made his final cabinet selection ensuring that there would be no Hispanic representation in the cabinet for the first time in 36 years. Trump and his supporters are certainly sending a message to Hispanics   and Vela noticed it a long time ago. In June, Vela condemned Trump in an open letter, which said: Mr. Trump, you re a racist and you can take your border wall and shove it up your ass. Vela is now joining the dozens of Democrats that are boycotting the inauguration. In his statement, Vela slammed Trump for his repeated acts of disrespect for the 33 million Americans of Hispanic descent  and widespread promotion of bigotry. In a statement that embodies how the majority of Americans are feeling right now, Vela said: The hope that his actions as President would not match his political rhetoric is becoming more and more of a distant dream.

 Trump To Cut DOJ’s 25 Violence Against Women Grants And Programs,"In an effort to slash $10.5 trillion in government spending over the next 10 years, Donald Trump has decided that the first target will be the Department of Justice s 25 grants and programs aimed at implementing the federal Violence Against Women Act. This means that every grant authorized by the law over the last 25 years will be eliminated in their entirety.To put it in perspective, Trump s cuts are double that of the cuts sought by House Speaker Paul Ryan and the Republican House caucus.The Violence Against Women Act, a bipartisan law passed in the early 1990s, has been reauthorized twice and is tasked with protecting, aiding, counseling and saving women from abuse, harassment, intimidation and stalking.Some of the 25 grants offered from the DOJ include:All of those grants will be gone, rendering the programs (and the act overall) moot.The man who  loves women  is about to defund all the services that protect them from abuse and battery.Let that sink in.The Republican war on women has taken a dramatic and ugly turn, and it s all thanks to Donald Trump.Democrats tried to warn America. It would make sense that a man who routinely calls women bimbos, bitches, and dogs, and brags about sexually groping them, would target the programs that help them when they re most vulnerable.There is no skating around this   the incoming administration is vehemently sexist and misogynistic. Republicans in the past, including the Bush Administration, have not leveled the kind of assault on women that the Trump Administration is preparing to do. Again, it should be noted that this is an extreme position to take, one that diverges from even typical GOP standards.Instead of cutting the bloated Defense budget and rolling back fat-cat kickbacks for corporations, they re going to target abused women and children   even as domestic violence becomes one of the largest public health crises in America.Hopefully House and Senate Republicans, including the female members, will stand up to these outrageous cuts.More importantly, where s Ivanka Trump? Isn t she supposed to be the new unsung hero of modern day feminism?Women of all stripes and ideologies   Republican and Democrat   should be outraged. Abuse doesn t pick a political party. Vulnerability doesn t pick a political party. And a political party (or administration) should not be making life harder for those in need.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images",News,19-Jan-17
 Trump Spokesman Reveals ASTONISHINGLY Racist Reason Kanye West Wasn’t Invited To Inauguration,"Even after famously meeting with Donald Trump last month, and even after Trump has had an historically difficult time finding A-list musicians willing to debase themselves enough to perform at his inauguration, the planning committee said no to Kanye West as its star or anything else, and the reason is incredibly racist. He s not  traditionally American  enough. What in heaven s name could that mean, hmmmm?A spokesperson for president-elect Donald Trump s inauguration committee told CNN that Friend of Donald Kanye West was not invited to perform at the real estate mogul s inaugural because  Ye s music wasn t right for the  typically and traditionally American event.  Tom Barrack, chairman of the Presidential Inauguration Committee, told CNN s Erin Burnett that the inauguration wasn t a  fitting  venue for West, who famously met with Trump in December and posed for a stiff photo at Trump Tower afterwards and whose music is about to be the subject of a course at Washington University in St. Louis called  Politics of Kanye West: Black Genius and Sonic Aesthetics. He s been great, he considers himself a friend of the president-elect, but it s not the venue.  Kanye, who was born in Chicago and performs a style of music, hip-hop, that was invented in the United States on the streets of Trump s New York in the late 1970s, performed at MTV s Inaugural Youth Ball in honor of President Obama in 2009.  It s going to be typically and traditionally American, and Kanye is a great guy, we just haven t asked him to perform. And we move on with our agenda,  Barrack added.Source: BillboardHere s the video:Damn @kanyewest couldn t even get to perform at this friend @realDonaldTrump s inauguration b/c the event is  Traditionally American . pic.twitter.com/wu3EezncR2  Unstripped Voice (@UnstrippedVoice) January 18, 2017Looking over the list of inaugural entertainers, it s clear that  typically and traditionally American  means white, with a few exceptions. Most are country artists. There are a couple of African-American R&B singers, there s Travis Green, and there s an Indian-American DJ named RaviDrums. To give that extra-American oomph, Trump s ball will feature Irish dance.Trump may have done West a favor. After expressing his theoretical support for Trump (he didn t actually vote, but if he had voted ), West was forced to cancel his tour. We ll see if the D-list acts they ve managed to book suffer the same fates, assuming they re popular enough to currently be on tour.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images.",News,19-Jan-17
 WATCH: Trump Press Sec. Says Hispanics Aren’t Part Of Cabinet Because Only ‘Best And Brightest’ Can Serve,"For the first time since 1988, Latinos will be totally shut out from having any role in an administration.Despite the fact that Latinos make up 17 percent of the population in the United States, Trump apparently does not want them anywhere near him or his presidency, which makes it clear that he intends to treat them like second-class citizens over the next four years. We re extremely worried. This is anti-democratic,  National Hispanic Leadership Agenda chairman Hector Sanchez told the Dallas Morning News after Trump chose a middle-aged white guy to be Secretary of Agriculture, the last cabinet position to be filled. Trump has not only been the most anti-Latino, anti-immigrant president in the history of the nation; by not including Latinos in the Cabinet he is just showing how he is planning to govern,  Sanchez continued.Indeed, the alarming absence of Latinos in Trump s cabinet caught the notice of the media, who promptly asked Trump s official mouthpiece, Sean Spicer, about it.His response is flat-out offensive. I think that when you look at the totality at his administration   the people that he s talked to, the people that he s met with, the people that he s appointing   you see a president who s committed to uniting this country, who s bringing the best and brightest together. Look at the cabinet   Elaine Chao, Dr. Ben Carson, Nikki Haley, the first Indian-American. Not only is Spicer suggesting that Latinos are not  the best and brightest,  he s suggesting that Ben Carson is actually one of the  best and brightest.  Let s not forget that Carson thinks the ancient pyramids were built to be grain silos, something that is totally wrong and has been mocked by archaeologists.Spicer then doubled down, claiming that Americans should focus on whether Trump is hiring the best people for the jobs, and claimed that Trump s cabinet is  diverse. Here s the video via YouTube.Again, Latinos are the fastest growing demographic in this country. There should be at least one in an administration that is supposed to represent all of America. Trump and his team can t honestly say that they couldn t find a person of Hispanic descent who is qualified to work in any cabinet position. But 17 percent of our nation s population will be alienated by Trump.Trump s claim that his cabinet is ideologically diverse and filled with the  best and brightest  is also bullshit. Not only did Trump only pick conservatives to fill his cabinet, all but two are men and all but two are white. That s not even close to being diverse. Furthermore, as The Atlantic points out, the only nominee who has experience running a federal agency is Elaine Chao. Plus, most of his cabinet picks want to destroy the departments they have been selected to lead.In no way are these the  best and brightest.  And you can be damn sure that Latinos will punish Trump and Republicans for it in 2018 and 2020 when the next midterm and presidential elections give the American people a chance to fix the mistake made in 2016.Featured Image via Twitter",News,19-Jan-17
 Rick Perry’s Confirmation Hearing Just Got Extremely Uncomfortable During Exchange With Al Franken (VIDEO),"Things got a bit uncomfortable during Rick Perry s confirmation hearing for a position in a department he forgot existed, then wanted to eliminate, and literally just learned what it does. Now he wants to run it. I have learned a great deal about the important work being done every day by the outstanding men and women of the DOE,  Perry said in his opening statement at his confirmation hearing.  My past statements made over five years ago about abolishing the Department of Energy do not reflect my current thinking. In fact, after being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy, I regret recommending its elimination. The thought of Rick Perry being in charge of our nation s nuclear stockpile is terrifying, but we were treated to a rare bit of levity during the former Texas Governor s exchange with Senator Al Franken.The Senator thanked Trump s nominee for recently visiting him in his office.  Did you enjoy meeting me?  Franken joked. That s when things got weird. Perry uttered a sentence that will almost assuredly be memed for months or even years to come: I hope you are as much fun on that dais as you were on your couch. May I rephrase that?  Perry asked. Please. Please. Please,  Franken replied.  Oh my lord. Oh my lord. Watch it for yourself, below:Featured image via screengrab",News,19-Jan-17
 WATCH: Hypocrite Bill O’Reilly Accuses Liberals Of ‘Sedition’ For Calling Trump Illegitimate,"Clearly, Fox host Bill O Reilly wasn t paying attention over the last eight years.Because if he had been paying attention, he would know that conservatives sought to delegitimize President Obama repeatedly.The principle claim, of course, was that President Obama was not born in the United States, a conspiracy theory that Donald Trump adopted for his own gain and continued to repeat during the campaign. Republicans in Congress also repeatedly attempted to sabotage the country in order to make Obama a one-term president and even after winning a second term Republicans continued to refuse to work with him.In fact, Republicans went so far as to pledge allegiance to foreign leaders like Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu rather than acknowledge Obama as their president.Republican racism and hatred toward President Obama divided America for eight years, yet conservatives like O Reilly have the gall to blame him for it. And now he is accusing those who oppose Donald Trump of sedition.During an interview with a very unfunny Dennis Miller, who claims to be a comedian, O Reilly asked if he believes the effort in opposition to Trump is  anti-American. Do you believe that this whole movement to delegitimize Donald Trump is anti-American?  O Reilly asked.  Would you say it s that bad? Miller cracked another pathetic  joke  that not even O Reilly could laugh at and O Reilly continued by going a step further. These people want to delegitimize the whole election, the whole presidency, and I think it borders on sedition,  he said.Miller then blamed President Obama for how divided the country has become even though Republicans were the ones who divided it in the first place and Trump continued to divide it on the campaign trail.Here s the video via YouTube.Bill O Reilly, like most conservatives, are hypocrites. Over the last eight years, they desperately tried to convince the American people that President Obama was illegitimate in order to sabotage his presidency and I don t remember O Reilly throwing out words like  sedition  to describe that un-American effort.The fact is that Trump lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, and his electoral win is one of the smallest on record. Furthermore, the Russians helped Trump by launching cyber attacks against our country and spreading propaganda. And Trump has done nothing but suck up to Putin, proving that he ll be a Russian puppet instead of the American president. But you ll only hear O Reilly whine about how people aren t lining up to kiss Trump s ass. Well, he better buckle up because turnabout is fair play because if anyone is a true illegitimate president it s Donald Trump. And unlike the birther conspiracy, there is plenty of proof backed up by the intelligence community.Featured Image: Screenshot ",News,19-Jan-17
 WATCH: Lewis Black Hilariously BURNS Trump And Mocks Inauguration On The Daily Show,"If Lewis Black really does have a ticket to the inauguration, Donald Trump is probably trying to revoke it right now.Because during Wednesday night s Daily Show, the comedian roasted Trump, taking particular aim at Trump s inauguration problems.For weeks, Trump and his team have been desperately trying to find an A-list celebrity to perform at the inauguration. For the most part, Trump has failed, so he has resorted to hiring a reality show contestant and a has-been band, while forcing the Radio City Rockettes to perform because they can be fired for saying no.Black informed Trump that if he wants to know why many celebrities died in 2016, it s because they didn t want to perform at the inauguration either. You want to know why so many celebrities died in 2016? It was to get out of playing the goddamn inauguration,  Black quipped.Then Black pointed out that Trump is pretending he doesn t really care if A-list celebrities show up, even going so far as to claim that he s the one who rejected them and not the other way around.The so-called  A  list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016Black was able to get a ticket, however, and he intends to show up on Friday whether Trump likes it or not. I ve got my tickets, and I m going to go no matter what,  Black said.  Because I want to be there when Trump touches the Bible and his hand catches on fire. Black went on to break the news to Trump that even Richard Nixon was able to land A-list talent for his inaugural ceremony by getting legendary entertainer James Brown to sing. All Trump has been able to get so far is Jackie Evancho, who didn t even win America s Got Talent.To make matters worse, Trump s team literally humiliated themselves by bragging about the participation of the Caisson Platoon and the famous army horse Black Jack. The problem is that Black Jack has been dead since 1976. Trump is  tweeting a dead horse,  Black quipped.Black then revealed Trump s inauguration them is  soft sensuality  which Black says is good because at least Trump is going to f*ck America  gently. Here s the video via YouTube.With an embarrassment like Trump in office, comedians like Lewis Black are definitely going to have plenty of material over the next four years.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,19-Jan-17
 Trump’s Pre-Inauguration Tweets Just Earned Him An Epic Smackdown From The Internet (TWEETS),"Though he is facing down six intelligence agencies  investigations into alleged illegal payments Trump received from the Kremlin to fund The Donald s efforts to become President by any means necessary, Friday marks the day that he becomes President   and if you thought assuming the most powerful office in the world would stop Trump from tweeting like an angst-plagued middle schooler, you were sorely mistaken.On Thursday, Trump hopped on Twitter to announce that he s headed to Washington D.C.   and, of course, to quote right-wing icon Franklin Graham s idiotic claim that someone who isn t Trump (hint: Obama) being the guy who divided the country rather than the dude who called Mexicans rapists, wants to ban Muslims from entering the country, and who offered to pay legal fees if his supporters beat up black people at his rallies.

 Conservative ‘Christians’ Get Their Asses Handed To Them For Supporting Healthcare Repeal,"A former evangelical Christian is ripping conservatives for repealing the Affordable Care Act.Bruce Horst knows what it is like to have pre-existing conditions while trying to purchase health insurance. Prior to Obamacare, insurance companies refused to cover him, leaving him and his family vulnerable if a health crisis ever arose. But because of Obamacare, people with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied health insurance.Obamacare literally saved Horst and his family from the threat of bankruptcy over a medical issue.But last week during a late night vote, Republicans in the Senate and House voted to repeal the healthcare law that covers over 30 million Americans.And conservatives cheered.Well, that didn t sit well with Horst, who despite being an atheist, probably knows the Bible better than most of these so-called evangelical  Christians  do.So Horst took these fake Christians to the woodshed on Facebook for applauding the death sentence Republicans just handed to millions of human beings. I have the simple conviction that it is immoral to give a person medical help according to how much they can pay,  Horst wrote.  Or maybe it s because of what I ve read in the Bible. In 2010 I had been a Conservative Evangelical Christian for all of my adult life. I began to realize that others around me despised the thought of allowing people like me the benefit of affordable health insurance. For some reason, all of the Christians that I knew thought that offering health insurance to people like me would put them at some kind of a disadvantage that they were not willing to accept. Frankly, they had been lied to so they believed those  others  were going to get healthcare and make their own healthcare inadequate.As a Christian, I believed that I would be judged on the Final Judgment Day on how I took care of the  least of these  as described in the Bible book of Matthew, chapter 25. I came to the sober realization that Christians around me had no such convictions. If they didn t believe Jesus  words as recorded in the Bible, why should I? Then one day I discovered I could no longer believe any of it.While conservatives complain that not as many people are attending church anymore, it turns out their hypocrisy and heartlessness is one of the reasons why people such as Horst have stopped believing. Stripping millions of Americans of the healthcare they need just further proved that Horst was right to leave the church when he did.Horst went on to call out Republicans in Congress and blasted how the hypocritical conservatives are when they claim to be  pro-life. I understand that Congress is about to take away the healthcare coverage of about 18 million of our fellow Americans. And they are doing this at the insistence of Conservative Evangelical Christians. I have friends who are alive today because of Obamacare. Probably all of us do. To me, this proves my Christian friends are not pro-life, but instead they ve been told they are as a matter of manipulation, probably to keep them putting money in the offering plate, or voting for the  right  candidate. One thing is clear to me, they are not really pro-life.I don t know what Congress is going to do with healthcare in the next few days. I would love to be surprised to find that President Trump has convinced Congress to extend healthcare coverage to all, and I would be among the first to be grateful for this. While even if this does occur, if my Christian friends insist that healthcare only be given to people based on their ability to pay for such care, I would have to believe that the Jesus of the Bible would say to them,  depart from me, I never knew you.  Just like He did in Matthew 25.In other words, conservatives are going to hell for condemning millions of Americans to suffer. It s not what Jesus would do and any conservative who says otherwise is only pretending to be a Christian.Featured Image: i.ytimg.com",News,19-Jan-17
 Donald Trump’s New Campaign Slogan Is LITERALLY From Horror Film ‘The Purge’,"Seriously, he really picked this as his 2020 slogan. We re all gonna die.Donald Trump hasn t even served a day as president, and won t officially do so until Monday since he has decided that the first two days after his inauguration will be vacation days. However, he has already picked a slogan on which to run during the 2020 campaign.During an interview with the Washington Post, Trump got all sorts of giddy about a slogan he thought of to use four years from now.According to the Washington Post,Halfway through his interview with The Washington Post, Trump shared a bit of news: He already has decided on his slogan for a reelection bid in 2020. Are you ready?  he said.    Keep America Great,  exclamation point. Get me my lawyer!  the president-elect shouted.Two minutes later, one arrived. Will you trademark and register, if you would, if you like it   I think I like it, right? Do this:  Keep America Great,  with an exclamation point. With and without an exclamation.  Keep America Great,    Trump said. Got it,  the lawyer replied.There s just one legal problem and one terrifying problem with this new slogan.First of all, the slogan has already been used by a movie as a tagline, so trademarking and registering it could be rather difficult and result in legal issues.Second, the movie Trump is apparently trying to steal the slogan from is  The Purge: Election Year,  which is an installment of a horror film series, set in America, in a dystopian future where every citizen in this country is allowed to commit any crime they want, no matter how horrible, for an entire day without consequences.Don t believe it? Here s the trailer via YouTube.Here s another one in which the lead character, a U.S. Senator played by Elizabeth Mitchell, explains that the annual  purge  targets the poor and the innocent.Trump picked a seriously f*cked up slogan this time, and considering that he will be in control of the White House while Republicans control Congress, everyone should be scared to death.Featured Image via screen capture from embedded video ",News,19-Jan-17
 Trump TERRIFIES Businesses So Badly They’re Doing THIS To Avoid His Dangerous Fits (DETAILS),"Trump really needs his Twitter account permanently suspended, or someone needs to find a way to permanently lock him out of the platform. His tweets claiming credit for job creation he had nothing to do with, plus his blasting companies when they don t do what he wants, and his threat of a 35 percent  border tax,  has businesses terrified of ending up on his radar.And how are they responding? By repeating job announcements, or preemptively announcing new jobs and investments in the U.S., as if they are new developments, in order to appease Trump and generate fake news about  new  jobs. After Trump blasted Toyota on his Twitter account, the industry was nervous and wondering who was next.Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017He s gone after Lockheed-Martin and Boeing, too, plus others. Kristin Dziczek, a spokeswoman for the Center for Automotive Research said: Pretty much everybody is dreading being the subject of a tweet. Getting hauled out into the court of public opinion with virtually no warning is not something anybody wants to get engaged with. So they re doing the only thing they can think of to do. They re appeasing him. They ve been cowed. They ve been bullied. They ve been intimidated and coerced and it s ridiculous and disgusting.Most of the things they re announcing in the way of investment and job creation are things that are years in the making. For instance, GM admitted that they accelerated their plans under pressure from Trump, but those plans very likely date back to 2014.And GM has been bringing jobs back to the U.S. for years already.Walmart s plans are their usual annual plans. Sprint s jobs were part of an older promise from their parent company to create 50,000 jobs in the U.S. And Bayer and Monsanto, if they re allowed to merge, will be investing and spending what they already invest and spend here.Still, though, Trump has the entire corporate world running scared. If they were running scared in the right ways, this might actually be good. When they re acting because they re afraid of the president and his Twitter account, there s a serious problem.The automakers have started to time their announcements so that they appear to be Trump s doing, for the sole purpose of staying out of his line of fire. Other companies will probably start following suit, if for no other reason than to avoid having their reputations and stocks tank because Trump had a snit on Twitter.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",News,18-Jan-17
 BOMBSHELL: Trump Is Being Investigated By SIX Intelligence Agencies For Illegal Cash Payments From Putin,"You can probably expect Donald Trump to continue his seemingly endless string of tweets about the  fake news  from a baker s dozen intelligence agencies that says that he and his friends may have been involved in some rather unethical actions involving a certain Russian dictator, Trump s campaign staff, and possibly a whole mess of Russian lady pee.McClatchy DC reports that the FBI and five other law enforcement agencies, including the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Justice Department, the Treasury Department s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and representatives of the Director of National Intelligence, are investigating whether the Kremlin took efforts to secure victory for The Donald. And apparently, Israeli spies were correct when they said that things were a lot worse than some nice escorts  draining the swamp on Trump s bed. McClatchy s report says:Investigators are examining how money may have moved from the Kremlin to covertly help Trump win, the two sources said. One of the allegations involves whether a system for routinely paying thousands of Russian-American pensioners may have been used to pay some email hackers in the United States or to supply money to intermediaries who would then pay the hackers, the two sources said.The informal, inter-agency working group began to explore possible Russian interference last spring, long before the FBI received information from a former British spy hired to develop politically damaging and unverified research about Trump, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the inquiry.Trump, who will be handed the nuclear launch codes and all of our country s secrets on Friday, has spent quite a bit of time praising, quoting, and agreeing with Vladimir Putin while attacking the intelligence agencies who are doing their jobs and attempting to bring a criminal   him   to justice. For his part, Trump has called the allegations against him a  political witch hunt  and a  complete and total fabrication,  and Americans who care about whether he colluded with the Kremlin  stupid people  and  fools. Trump may have screamed that Hillary Clinton should be  locked up,  but it may be that he is the one who will end up behind bars.Featured image by Scott Olson via Getty Images",News,18-Jan-17
 Trump Just Offered The Most BIZARRE Excuse For Russian Prostitute Urination Scandal (VIDEO),"With President-elect Donald Trump s inauguration just days away, it seems like he s still trying to clean up his most recent messes and scandals.One of the most recent bombshells to shake up Trump s deeply flawed transition was the public release of an unverified report that Trump had paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed President Barack Obama had previously slept in while visiting a hotel in Russia. In an interview with Fox News s Ainsley Earhardt, it seems like Trump is still trying to convince America that he didn t do it   and his excuses continue to get more pathetic. Trump said: It s fake news. It s all fake news. You know, I can say something about George Washington, I can say something about Abraham Lincoln, I can say something about you. I can just   fake news and [the CIA] shouldn t have been a part of it. Clearly nervous about the fact that Penthousehas recently offered a $1 million prize to anyone who could produce the tapes of the scandal, Trump s insecurity and panic came right through as he went into a weird denial-infused rant. Trump said: It s made up. Never existed. Never happened. And the reason I say that so strongly because nothing is ever going to show up. There s never going to be a tape that shows up. There s never going to be anything that shows up. Now, I would be very embarrassed if a tape actually showed up, saying something like that. It would be double embarrassed because I m saying there is no tape. There is no event. I was never even in that room for that period of time. Then, Trump ripped everyone from the GOP to the Democratic Party to the media: It started with the Republican Party when they tried to beat me in the nomination and it went on. The Democrats took over the work, supposedly. And by the intelligence giving it credence by just even talking about it   it was very inappropriate. So I don t know who the leaker was. I have no idea, but it s fake news. You can watch Trump miserably fail at doing damage control below:Featured image is a screenshot",News,18-Jan-17
 Insane Trump Ally Claims He’s Victim Of Russian-Style Assassination Attempt (VIDEO),"Out of all the insane people who are part of Trump s posse, former campaign manager Roger Stone has to win the loony prize. Stone regularly immerses himself with full-on white supremacists. During the presidential campaign, Stone was so insane that he (was forced to) quit because of all the controversy surrounding him. Apparently, he didn t want to upstage the candidate s own controversies. Now he says he has been poisoned because he knows too much about Russia, only it s not Russia, he says, that s doing the poisoning.On Tuesday, Stone appeared on conspiracy nut Alex Jones  InfoWars claiming that he had been poisoned with polonium, which is Putin and the Russian s poison of choice. However, Stone is making the claim that it was Congress (or something) that poisoned him. I became extremely ill. This manifested itself in over 14 days of high fever, delirium, night sweats, I had lesions on my chest and my face,  Stone explained to Jones.  The general consensus is I was poisoned. I was poisoned with polonium or a substance that has the characteristics of polonium and this made me exceedingly ill.  Stone s theory is that someone poisoned him because he has proof that Russia was not behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta,  This is about stopping the Trump agenda,  he said.  I would blow the whistle on this whole bogus Russian narrative that they just won t let go of.

The far more believable explanation is that Stone, who nobody really gives a crap about, wasn t poisoned and that he s trying to hawk his new book.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,18-Jan-17

Not only that, but Colbert had to admit something terrible   that he and white supremacists have one thing in common, they are absolutely disappointed in Trump   albeit clearly for different reasons.The Late Show host even pointed out that Trump will blame everything on being rigged if it doesn t go his way.

 Texas Diner Owner ANNIHILATED Over Horribly Racist MLK Day Lunch Special (VIDEO),"Anyone with half a brain knows that foods like fried chicken and watermelon have historically been used to disparage African Americans. It s another part of our ugly history here, dating back to slavery and Jim Crow. The idea is to depict us as lazy and intellectually inferior to our white counterparts. So, with that in mind, what does the owner of a Texas diner do in celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day? Runs a lunch special of chicken and waffles with a side of watermelon.Sabrina Pyle, who owns Azle Cafe in the Texas town of the same name, insists she wasn t being racist by celebrating a civil rights icon like Martin Luther King, Jr., by promoting racist stereotypes, but it was too late. Someone saw the social media post promoting her bigoted lunch special, and soon, all of Facebook and other platforms were calling her out on her bullshit. Pyle defended herself by saying: I wasn t thinking about the historical (context). I was thinking, we have margaritas and tacos on Cinco de Mayo, so, let s have some fun with Martin Luther King Day.

 Trump Stages Photo Of Himself ‘Writing’ His Own Inaugural Address And Gets Hilariously Burned By The Internet,"Donald Trump claims he is writing his own Inaugural Address and posted an image to Twitter as  proof.  The Internet laughed out loud.Trump looks like he is not enjoying anything that requires thinking and the image is clearly staged to once again dupe his gullible supporters into believing that he is actually writing it himself. Trump also dubbed his Mar-a-Lago resort the  winter White House,  which also pissed people off.Writing my inaugural address at the Winter White House, Mar-a-Lago, three weeks ago.

 Tiffany Trump And Her Mother Just Tried To Get An EXPENSIVE Service For Free Because They’re Rich,"Freelancers love entitled people, really we do, especially when those entitled people are also rich. Giving away our services to those who can easily pay market rates for them is just so much better than, you know, getting paid in actual dollars that we can turn around and use to pay our bills. And Tiffany Trump and her mother, Trump s second wife Marla Maples, just put themselves into the category of rich, entitled jagoffs who think people owe them work for free.They re both going to Trump s inauguration on Friday, and of course, they have to look absolutely perfect. That means getting their hair and makeup done by stylists and artists. Tricia Kelly, a freelance stylist, received word from a contact with connections to the Trumps that Tiffany and Marla were looking for someone to do this work for them. So she got in touch, gave them her rates for both work and travel, and Marla wasn t having it:But Maples, through her assistant, balked.  I was told they had a $300 budget for both of them for hair and makeup,  Kelly says.How the hell do those two only have a $300 budget? A regular person with a decent-paying job has a $300 budget for this (maybe). Maples reportedly has a net worth of $20 million. Tiffany has a reported net worth of just $600,000, but she s also 22 and she s also Maples  daughter. And they only have a budget of $300 for this?Please, don t make us laugh too hard. It hurts.Kelly managed to negotiate a total cost of $350, which is still absurdly cheap. But that s apparently when things got really ridiculous. After Kelly got Maples  assistant to agree to that rate, she then asked if Kelly would be willing to do the work  for exposure.  It s not even  exposure  in the form of a tear sheet she could put in a portfolio, or something else tangible.No this exposure would be in the form of Maples mentioning her on social media.Jesus fucking Christ but these people are spoiled rotten brats. And when Kelly wouldn t do it, she got veiled threats in return: You are messing with the president of the United States,  the Maples contact wrote her, adding that Maples was worried about her financial situation with Tiffany out of college, ending child-support payments from the president-elect.  She is used to a certain lifestyle and you don t understand that. So? She s still worth $20 million, so she can shut it. And even if one could say there was a legitimate worry about money now, well, like the rest of us, if she can t afford a pricey service, then she can jolly well do without. She is not entitled to people s work without compensation any more than any of the rest of us are.Sure, there are stylists, artists and designers who are willing to loan things to, or do complimentary work for, A-list celebrities because that is exposure that will translate into more paying work and better rates and prices. Sorry to say, though, that Marla and Tiffany are not exactly A-listers here. And they are associated with politics, which people working in these fields tend to shun unless they re getting paid.Kelly was shocked by the entitlement complex, as any of us would have been in her shoes: There are people who make far less than they do who pay full price,  she said.  People on staff   the incoming White House and the outgoing one  pay full price. It seemed like they were trying to see how much they could get for free based on their names. The market rates for these services run anywhere from $1,200 to over $5,000. So even the $350 that Maples  assistant said they would pay was a pittance.Seriously? Give us a break. In other words, she and Tiffany are just as used to getting what they want from us peons as Cheetolini and the rest of his family. And if they want you to work for free, then dammit, you will work for free or you will face the consequences, and that is that.Featured image by Kevin Winter via Getty Images",News,18-Jan-17

 WATCH: People Interviewed Explain Why Affordable Care Act Is Better Than Obamacare,"You ve seen the tweets and Facebook comments from conservatives who prefer the Affordable Care Act Over Obamacare   which are totally the same thing. What conservatives really want is for President Obama s name to not be attached to his signature legislation. Trump is discussing  Insurance for everyone  which sounds a lot like Single Payer, something we might have had except that conservatives kept yelling for the gubbermint to keep their socialist hands off their Medicare. Whatever. So, we ended up with a watered down version of health care.Late night host Jimmy Kimmel again used his  Man on the street  segment to interview (mock) those who do not know there is no difference between Obamacare and the ACA. It s a straight-up partisan issue with supporters of the President who preferred Obamacare and Trump fans who preferred the Affordable Care Act.Kimmel wanted to see if people had learned anything since the time he did a similar segment three years ago. We decided to ask this question again to see if Americans had learned everything over the last three years,  Kimmel said. And unfortunately, nothing has changed.A woman the interviewer approached said she  doesn t support Obama so I don t support the Obama-things he s got going on. So, you don t like anything Obama does and you prefer the Affordable Care Act?  he asked the woman.  She said,  Absolutely. One man said he supports the Affordable Care Act because his girlfriend is a Trump supporter.Another man said the difference between the two is that  one you pay and the other Obama pays for you. I believe with Obamacare the premiums are too high, so I believe in the Affordable Care Act,  another man who was interviewed said. So, the Affordable Care Act is more affordable than Obamacare?  the interviewer asked. Correct,  the man said.  Which is obvious because it s in the name. The interviewer told one woman who admitted she doesn t like Obama,  What if I told you Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are the same thing? She just stood there like a deer caught in the headlights.One guy was just too stoned to grasp the question.Watch:This is why we can t have nice things.Image via screen capture",News,18-Jan-17
 Trump’s Education Secretary Gets ROASTED After Saying Guns In Schools Will Prevent Bear Attacks (TWEETS/VIDEO),"Our children are at risk, people! Fortunately, there is one woman who is willing to take a brave stand and confront this danger head-on   Trump education secretary pick Betsy DeVos. On Tuesday, supergenius DeVos was asked a very simple question: Do you think guns have any place in or around schools? Now, most of us would have answered that question with a simple  no,  but not DeVos. She sees a danger the rest of us are missing: bears.But never fear! Trump would never appoint someone who is completely unqualified to any position. Sure, she doesn t know that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is a thing, but  DeVos has the perfect answer to this hidden and severe threat against our children   a whole bunch of motherf*cking guns.DeVos says the decision to allow guns in schools is best left to locales and states to decide  because bear attacks are apparently a thing, and we wouldn t want students undefended while Yogi searches their school for a pic-a-nic basket, would we? I will refer back to Senator Enzi and the school he was talking about in Wyoming,  DeVos said.  I would imagine that there is probably a gun in the schools to protect from potential grizzlies.  As it turns out, Wyoming schools do not keep a pile of guns around to deal with an ever-looming threat of bear attacks.UPDATE: Teacher at Wyoming school Betsy DeVos said needed guns to shoot ""grizzlies"" says that's ""absolutely"" untruehttps://t.co/dWneudD0Tf pic.twitter.com/oVb8kEdAgL  Tom McKay (@thetomzone) January 18, 2017But, hey, at least the folks on Twitter are having fun:Screenshot from the National Geographic special Betsy DeVos watched to prove grizzly bears are a threat to schools  pic.twitter.com/c3ATfOdMJy  Guy Fi-hairy (@ih8_mayo) January 18, 2017Betsy DeVos took @StephenAtHome very literally. #GrizzlyBears #DeVosHearing pic.twitter.com/OKpsE3UQNk  FooseBallsOFire (@FooseBallsOFire) January 18, 2017We can't tell you how many times in the past year we've had a lockdown because  #grizzlybears. ? #NotMySOE #StopDeVos #DeVosHearing  Wa Badass Teachers A (@WaBATs_) January 18, 2017Maybe grizzly bears can home school your kids.

" Donald Trump’s Latest Namesake Has Bad Hair And Small Genitals, But It Flies","Before running the most controversial and bombastic political campaign in recent presidential history, Donald Trump was perhaps best known for plastering his name, preferably plated in gold, across absolutely everything he could   especially on very tall phallic symbols. He might not be as proud of his latest namesake, though. It s a moth and it s known for its weird  hair  and its tiny genitalia.Image via Twitter.This centimeter-wide moth was identified by evolutionary biologist and lepidopterist Vazrick Nazari, who announced the find in a paper published Tuesday in the open-access journal ZooKeys. Nazari settled on the name N. donaldtrumpi because the silky yellow-white scales these moths develop on their heads in adulthood reminded him of the President-elect s signature hairdo.By meticulously examining specimens of the moth and its close relatives, Nazari was able to catalogue its unique anatomy, including its male genitalia, which is  comparatively smaller  than the moth s close relative Neopalpa neonata, according to the study.Source: MotherboardOh, but it gets worse for the President Elect. The moth is native to Trump s nemesis state of California, and into Mexico. Did I mention that it has really tiny genitals? Well, it s worth mentioning again.The moth is also known as a Twirler Moth, and like the man it s named from, it exhibits unexplainable bursts of frantic behavior. If it had hands, it would probably be tweeting weird vendettas at 3:00 am as well.Naming the moth after Trump wasn t just a silly jab at the thin-skinned man baby about to occupy the Oval Office. It was a pretty clever attempt at bringing attention to the moth and to the environment. By naming this species after the 45th President of the United States, I hope to bring some public attention to, and interest in, the importance of alpha-taxonomy in better understanding the neglected micro-fauna component of the North American biodiversity. The timing couldn t be better. Republicans are already set to roll back parts of the Endangered Species Act.Dr. Peter Oboyski, manager and curator of the Essig Museum of Entomology at University of California, Berkeley, hopes that this finding will help bring attention to all species of moths, most of which we may never discover, before they go extinct. As for Trump, Dr. Oboyski said:Hopefully our new president will take pride in having a species named for him, recognize the enormous task set before biologists and encourage his administration to support research to discover and describe the overwhelming biodiversity all around us while it is still there.Let s hope.Featured image via Christopher Furlong/Getty Images",News,17-Jan-17
" Russians Mint ‘In Trump We Trust’ Coin To Commemorate U.S. Inauguration (IMAGE, VIDEO)","Just before the Inauguration for the president-elect, a Russian metal working company has minted a sterling silver coin to commemorate Donald Trump s big day. The coin features Trump s face and the Statue of Liberty is on the flip side. The coin includes the slogan  In Trump we trust.  Well, Russia certainly trusts Trump more than American citizens do. Trump will enter the Oval Office with the worst approval rating in modern history for a president-elect.Only 45 of the limited-edition coins have been made.Image: screen capture via Associated Press. The man in charge of  Art-Grani,  spoke with the the Associated Press Television News and said the coins were designed to express his and other Russian business leaders   hopes associated with Trump. Vladimir Vasyukhin s company is about 650 miles east of Moscow, in south-central Russia s Chelyabinsk region. He said, there are more hopes associated with Trump with regards to the lifting of sanctions; maybe the environment (between the U.S. and Russia) will change. CBS reports:Mr. Trump even suggested in an interview with the Times of London several days ago that he might be willing to drop some of the sanctions against Moscow in exchange for an agreement on nuclear arms reduction. Moscow s reaction to the proposal was muted, and on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he didn t actually see it as a proposal from the incoming president.Five of the commemorative coins will be cast in silver and the others will be cast in gold.They measure almost five inches in diameter and weigh about two pounds each, similar to coins made by the company featuring Putin and other notable Russians.Watch:We re wondering when the president-elect s accent will start changing to Russian. Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader who is  very smart. Vasyukhin said the coins will sell for thousands of dollars and added that his company would like to give the first coin to Trump. Maybe Trump could use the coin to pay back some of the money he owes to Russian banks.Coincidentally, Ann Coulter authored a book titled,  In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!

" U.S. Press Corps Breaks Silence, Drops MAJOR Bombshell In SCATHING Open Letter To Trump (DETAILS)","The way President-elect Donald Trump has treated the press during his presidential campaign, only to get far worse after winning the election, is nothing but terrifying. Trump has not only ditched press pools and created distrust for the media, but he has issued threats to punish or silence reporters for doing their jobs and holding him accountable. Trump has never sounded more like a dictator, and quite frankly we should all be very worried about what he s going to do once he gets into the White House.Fortunately, the press is fighting back. Editor in chief and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review Kyle Pope has just written an open letter to Trump on behalf of the U.S. Press Corps, and it s a strong message to Trump that things aren t going to go the way he wants them to go. Pope wrote: In these final days before your inauguration, we thought it might be helpful to clarify how we see the relationship between your administration and the American press corps. Pope then expertly outlined several attacks Trump has made on the press which have made the relationship between Trump and journalists extremely tense. Pope said: You ve banned news organizations from covering you. You ve taken to Twitter to taunt and threaten individual reporters and encouraged your supporters to do the same. You ve advocated for looser libel laws and threatened numerous lawsuits of your own, none of which has materialized. But while you have every right to decide your ground rules for engaging with the press, we have some, too. Pope noted that even if Trump tried to prevent journalists from having access to him, the media would not back down. Pope warned the President-elect that the press would merely take it on as a  challenge : We are very good at finding alternative ways to get information   Telling reporters that they won t get access to something isn t what we d prefer, but it s a challenge we relish. Signaling that what Trump has really done by suppressing the media is unite it, Pope stated that the press would be working together to hold him accountable now, specifically pointing out a disgusting incident in which Trump belittled and attacked CNN reporter Jim Acosta at a press conference last week: We now recognize that the challenge of covering you requires that we cooperate and help one another whenever possible. So, when you shout down or ignore a reporter at a press conference who has said something you don t like, you re going to face a unified front. We ll work together on stories when it makes sense, and make sure the world hears when our colleagues write stories of importance. Pope made it perfectly clear that journalists were not going to play by his rules and have every intention of being involved in covering his presidency honestly and with transparency, no matter how much he hates it or threatens them. Pope said: We ve been around since the founding of the republic, and our role in this great democracy has been ratified and reinforced again and again and again. Enjoy your inauguration. This is EXACTLY what we needed our press to say to this tyrant, and we hope it terrifies him.Featured image via Drew Angerer / Getty Images",News,17-Jan-17
 Michael Moore Says He Is ‘Absolutely’ Convinced Trump Will Ban Muslims,"Filmmaker and activist Michael Moore said there is no doubt in his mind that Donald Trump will go through with banning Muslims from the United States, just like he said he would.Speaking to Variety, Moore said that he has already done his grieving over Trump s win, which he saw coming long before it became a reality. I went through my five stages of grief months and months ago when I realized he was going to win,  he said.Moore said that he has  taken him literally and seriously since day one,  which is why he fully expects Trump to do all the horrible things he said he would on the campaign trail, like building a wall along our southern border to keep out all the rapey Mexicans. You do have to take Trump at his word,  Moore said.  I still hear people say,  Oh, he s not really going to build the wall.  Oh, he is going to build it. He knows that he s got to deliver at least a version of the wall. This, Moore explained, is why he  absolutely  believes Trump will go through with enacting his Muslim ban. He s shown how he s going to do it,  Moore said.  He s going to get away with it by making it a ban on Muslims who come from the following countries. He needs just enough cover for his crowd to say,  Oh, he s being reasonable there. He s not banning all Muslims. Moore also said that he was profoundly affected by Meryl Streep s powerful speech denouncing Trump at the Golden Globes. I had tears in my eyes,  Moore said.  It was so powerfully delivered by the perfect person. She was talking about human empathy. It was not about being a Republican or a Democrat. It was about: Have you no decency, sir? Trump s supporters like to say that they don t take what he says literally. But that is a mistake. As Maya Angelou said,  When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.  We know who Trump is. And we also know it s going to be a long four years.Featured image via Kevin Winter/Getty Images For AFI",News,17-Jan-17
" Whoopi Goldberg FURIOUS Over Trump’s John Lewis Attacks, GOES OFF In PERFECT Pre-Inauguration Rant (VIDEO)","As the majority of Americans are completely depressed and worried sick over what is going to happen to this country after President-elect Donald Trump is officially in charge, The View came through to perfectly point out just why Trump is such a concern.On Tuesday, co-host Whoopi Goldberg brought up a topic that most of us are still extremely upset about, especially right after Martin Luther King Day   Trump s vicious attacks on civil rights leader and Democratic Congressman John Lewis. Tearing Trump a new one for throwing a temper tantrum just because Lewis said he didn t consider Trump a  legitimate  president (face it, most of us don t), Goldberg reminded Trump that he himself has been raising questions and conspiracy theories about President Barack Obama s legitimacy for years. Urging Trump to grow the hell up and  get yourself right , she pointed out just how thin-skinned Trump is when she said: You can t do it for eight years and then be pissed off that someone does the same thing to you, comrade. Look, that s what America is built on, man. And if you re going to be the president you ve got to get yourself right, because people are going to be coming at you because now there are questions about your presidency. Maybe the same kind of BS questions you might have had if you d been thinking, had you thought about this. The women on The View also made sure to note that Lewis, the man that Trump accused of being all talk, talk, talk   no action or results,  had suffered a fractured skull while marching with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Selma. Meanwhile, Trump had dodged the draft and has no examples of ever being of service to others. Clearly, we all know who the real bullsh*tter is here.Railing against Trump for his complete meltdown in the form of various Twitter attacks not only on Lewis, but on CIA director John Brennan and Alec Baldwin (and others), Goldberg said what most of us have been thinking the whole time: You ve got too much time on your hands, man. You better be trying to figure out what to do! Exactly. You can watch the women of The View rip Trump apart in the two-part series below:Featured image via screenshots",News,17-Jan-17
 Pres. Obama Just Saved Chelsea Manning On His Way Out The Door,"Presidential commutations and pardons are not at all uncommon. However, they can sometimes be controversial. President Obama s commutations and pardons are no different. Case in point   his commutation of former Army soldier Chelsea Manning s 35-year prison sentence for her activities regarding leaking secrets to Wikileaks.Manning was charged and prosecuted as Bradley Manning, and then, after a great struggle, underwent gender reassignment surgery in prison and changed her name to Chelsea Manning. There was plenty of evidence that, like many transgender people, Manning was treated inhumanely in the military prison. She has attempted suicide on two occasions, and it is reported that she did not receive proper care after her surgery. She has also been subjected to solitary confinement.With President Obama s action, the cruel and unusual punishment Manning has been subjected to will come to an end on May 17, 2017. Manning will have been in jail for roughly seven years at that time.This also may help bring Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to justice, as last week Wikileaks tweeted the following: If Obama grants Manning clemency Assange will agree to US extradition despite clear unconstitutionality of DoJ case. While there is no way of knowing if this is true or not, considering who Julian Assange is, it would certainly be a step in the right direction.Of course, conservatives are hating on the President s decision. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas tried to say that President Obama s using his power in this way is bad for the cause of criminal justice reform: I think on the larger issue of criminal justice reform, the president is really undermining our political capital by granting clemency at an unprecedented rate. People say, well why should we change the sentencing rules in criminal justice reform if the president can just do it with a flick of his pen? This is, of course, a load of BS, but facts and Republicans don t mix very well these days. Anyone with a brain knows that an overhaul of the so-called  justice  system is needed, full stop. A few commutations and pardons here and there will not change that fact.Good on you, Mr. President, for doing the right thing. We sure will miss you.Featured image via Flickr",News,17-Jan-17
 Eric Trump Promotes New Nickname For His Dad; Same One Cons Used To INSULT Obama (TWEET),"For years, conservatives have been attacking President Obama for supposedly taking too many vacations and playing golf. There was even a website set up to supposedly keep track of every outing.President Obama was even dubbed the  Golfer-in-Chief  as an insult.However, now that Donald Trump will be the guy who will sit in the Oval Office, being called the  Golfer-in-Chief  is suddenly a proud title.After Golf Digest did a piece on Trump, they made this the cover, and Eric Trump tweeted it out!Thank you to @GolfDigest for this incredible feature! ""Golfer-in-Chief"" @RealDonaldTrump https://t.co/vpdY4jNbI4 pic.twitter.com/Q5fzH4fpmH  Eric Trump (@EricTrump) January 17, 2017With dear old dad retweeting it, of course:via TwitterNow,  Golfer-in-Chief  is apparently a term of endearment and no longer an insult.Will hypocritical conservatives nationwide, who once slammed Obama for daring to take a moment off for 9-18 rounds of golf also slam Trump? Highly unlikely. They will likely say Trump deserves a little downtime to play a few rounds of golf whenever he pleases.After all, Trump is the hypocrite-in-chief so it s rather befitting.It s as if they are all goldfish, and nothing before today ever happened. Everything is shiny and new and insults are now terms of adoration. If Trump does it, it s magical. If Obama did it, it was evil. Even if it s the same f*cking thing.Featured Photo by Jeff J Mitchell via Getty Images",News,17-Jan-17
 VP Of Trump Transition Team To Dems: ‘Put Your Big Boy Pants On’ And Attend Inauguration (VIDEO),"The Women s March on Washington started out smaller, but now it s set to be one of the biggest protests in American history. The protest started out with tens of thousands of women expected to march, but then it went viral. Now men are joining the demonstration as well. Hundreds of thousands of protesters are expected to show up the day after Donald Trump is sworn in. In addition, more than 50 Democratic lawmakers are skipping the Inauguration. After Trump attacked Rep. John Lewis on Twitter, the number of lawmakers expected to opt out of attending rose from thirty to 56.In an interview with CNN s Chris Cuomo, the vice-president of Trump s transition team used odd wording on Tuesday to prompt Democrats to attend the Inauguration.Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI) said that Democrats need to put on their  big boy pants  and attend Friday s inauguration.Yeah, sure, that ll make them go.Duffy then blasted the Democratic lawmakers who say they will not attend Trump s big event. I was not thrilled, it was a very depressing day in 2008 and 2012 in the Duffy household when President Obama won reelection,  Duffy said.  We fought hard for the Republican candidate. We weren t happy. But guess what? We go to the inauguration, maybe with a heavy heart, but it s part of this American process that Republicans and Democrats come together as one America. While whining about the Inauguration, Duffy compared Democrats to children:Duffy compared the Democrats who are participating in the boycott to children who are  used to getting a juice box and a trophy  even when they lose. Listen, Donald Trump won,  he said.  You may not agree with his agenda just like we didn t agree with President Obama s agenda. But show up! That s your duty as a Republican congressman. Be part of the process. Duffy said that Republicans may not attend the next Democratic president s inauguration. Because what this does is, in the future, what happens with the next Democrat [sic] presidential election  are Republicans supposed to say that we re going to stay home, that these events become partisan in nature?  he remarked.  That s bad for the country. Show up, be part of it. Put your big boy pants on and let s start working together. Watch:Poor Sean. It s got to suck that Trump is the least popular president-elect in modern history. Meanwhile, President Obama will leave the office as the most successful Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. Obama s approval rating is soaring while Trump s is plunging.Trump has the worst approval rating in modern history while entering office.Featured image via screen capture",News,17-Jan-17
 Trump Now Desperately Buying Facebook Ads To Beg Americans He Called ‘Stupid’ To Come To Inauguration,"What if you threw a party and most of the people who would otherwise attend avoided it like a particularly virulent strain of syphilis had gone airborn in a ten-mile radius surrounding the National Mall? At this point, the festivities surrounding the inauguration of the United States  next Grand Wizard, Donald Trump, are shaping up to be a complete disaster that will be referenced in every non-Texas history book for generations to come.A minority of Americans and a broken system with a special helping hand from Vladimir Putin and James Comey may have barely  elected  Donald Trump President, but he remains the least popular person to step into the Oval Office since Osama bin Hitler took office in 1897 in an alternate timeline (that s right, we had to reach outside reality to find something to which we could compare Trump s  yuge  level of unpopularity).Trump may be bragging about the  record-setting turnout  he is expecting, but the truth is that he is crying on the inside. Officials are expecting 800,000 to 900,000 people to show up to see Trump being sworn in as our next President. On their own these numbers may seem impressive, but Obama s inauguration attracted double that   a whopping 1.8 million people showed up for him and as we all know, Trump desperately needs to feel like he has beaten Barack Obama at everything.Trump is so desperate that he has taken the rather interesting approach: shamelessly spending money to beg Americans to show up and adore him   well, people over the age of 27 who live in New York, anyway. F*ck the rest of you.imagine being so disliked that 4 days before your inauguration you start paying to send desperate FB ad invites to ""person, 27+"" pic.twitter.com/UQ0m4D7vg4  mah ree nah (@marinarachael) January 17, 2017? ? #Trump Is So Pathetic DesperateTo Fill His #Inauguration Seats He's Put An Ad On His #Facebook Page Inviting People @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/L9jChYlxdU  Marsha (@Whippenz) January 17, 2017Trump is paying $$$ to place a Facebook ad asking (begging) people (ages 27 + up) to attend his Swearing In Ceremony.Pathetic & So Sad . pic.twitter.com/MogbRNrmLj  J Reed (@EarthlingJR) January 17, 2017.@Facebook keeps serving me a video ad where Trump invites me to #Inauguration   but @TrumpInaugural website doesn't work.

Ticket scalpers are losing money on tickets to the event, which promises to be exactly as exciting as the average county fair (with matching entertainment). Trump has managed to snag obsolete one hit wonder pop band Three Doors Down and country artist who is known for showing up to concerts so drunk that he forgets the lyrics to his own songs. Other performances include a 16-year-old reality show contestant, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, a marching band from  Louisiana s most racist high school,  and whichever of the Rockettes decides to show up to this abortion of an event. Basically, if  I just got my Klan robes back from the drycleaner  is not a part of your vernacular, you re gonna have a bad time at this thing.Recently, Trump hate-tweeted the majority of Americans who are not OK with Russia hacking his political opponents on his behalf, calling them  stupid people  and  fools.

 WATCH: Republican Lawmaker Gets Relentlessly Booed And Heckled For Obamacare Repeal Vote,"The boos rained down after a Republican congresswoman thought she could get away with voting to strip millions of Americans of their healthcare.GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers made an appearance at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally to spew bullshit about unity and how  change and progress  have come to Washington DC because of Donald Trump.That didn t sit well with the crowd, who showered Rodgers with boos and jeers after someone in the audience literally shouted  Bullshit!  in response to her claims that she will work hard for the people in her district.Chants of  Save our healthcare!  then drowned out Rodgers, who fled the stage as someone called her a  liar. Here s the video via YouTube.Rodgers ignored the anger of her constituents and tried to drone on but soon left the stage. Considering that Rodgers is literally sentencing millions of people to death by voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act, she s lucky the crowd let her leave and didn t tar and feather her in the public square.Afterwards, she then released a bullshit statement claiming that Republicans are working on a  smooth transition  to repeal and replace Obamacare so people don t lose their coverage. No one who has coverage because of Obamacare today, will lose that coverage the day it s repealed   we re committed to a smooth and stable transition for those currently receiving care,  Rodgers said.A spokesperson for Rodgers later added, The Congresswoman looks forward to keeping the lines of communication open when discussing how to ensure a smooth and stable transition out of Obamacare to put in place a 21st Century health care system. Most Americans oppose repealing Obamacare without a suitable replacement or don t want it repealed at all.But Republicans voted to repeal Obamacare last week without having any plan at all to replace it with, and they STILL don t have a plan, despite how many times they claim to be working on one.Featured image via screenshot",News,17-Jan-17
 Donald Trump Vows To Start His Administration With A Vacation; The Internet ERUPTS,"While Donald Trump officially assumes the office of President on Friday, he says he ll be leaving the Oval Office chair empty until Monday. According to Trump, he ll spend the weekend partying instead of presidenting.In an interview with the Times of London, Trump said,  One of the first orders I m gonna sign   day one   which I will consider to be Monday as opposed to Friday or Saturday. Right? I mean my day one is gonna be Monday because I don t want to be signing and get it mixed up with lots of celebration, but one of the first orders we re gonna be signing is gonna be strong borders. Note, this is the same man who once said about President Obama,  It was reported today he played 250 rounds of golf and he s going to be in Hawaii, I think did they say for three weeks?  Trump said.  Two hundred and fifty rounds, that s more than a guy who plays in the PGA Tour plays. He played more golf last year than Tiger Woods. We don t have time for this. We have to work. While 250 rounds might sound like a lot, over eight years, that amounts to less than one round every 10 days. Historically, though, 250 rounds is a tiny blip. Woodrow Wilson played nearly 1,200 rounds during his administration and George W. Bush had Obama beat in vacation time.Trump s announcement probably won t sit well with his sycophants whose hopes hung on the 21 things he promised he d do on day one. Day three, day four, what s one more day for the leader of the free world?The internet, of course, exploded:The same people who spent 8 years counting POTUS  every round of golf now have no problem w/ Trump taking his FIRST weekend off.

 GOP Governor Demands A ‘Thank You’ From Rep. John Lewis Because Republicans Freed The Slaves,"Just when you thought Republicans couldn t be bigger pricks toward Rep. John Lewis, one governor is demanding that Lewis thank today s GOP for ending slavery in 1865.Rep. John Lewis is a civil rights hero who risked his life fighting for voting rights with Martin Luther King during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. He was at the Lincoln Memorial as King delivered his  I Have A Dream  speech, So he knows full well what President Abraham Lincoln and the early Republican Party did to free the slaves and advance civil rights.But that Republican Party has changed significantly over the last 150 years, and is now controlled by white supremacists and racists and spends most of its time trying to suppress voting rights and deny civil rights to people of color more than it does defending the legacy Lincoln built.Maine s Tea Party Governor Paul LePage, however, still thinks Republicans like himself deserve praise for something the party did over a century and a half ago.During an interview with WVOM, LePage criticized Lewis for calling Trump illegitimate and demanded that Lewis thank white Republicans for freeing the slave. John Lewis ought to look at history,  LePage said.  It was Abraham Lincoln who freed the slaves, it was Rutherford B. Hayes and Ulysses S. Grant who fought against Jim Crow laws. A simple thank you would suffice. Except that Hayes sold-out the fight for civil rights in exchange for the presidency. As the Bangor Daily News pointed out, Hayes struck  an informal deal after a contested election that gave him the White House in exchange for promising to pull Northern troops out of the South. Pulling out those troops marked the premature end of Reconstruction and the beginning of Jim Crow laws in the South that would remain intact for a century until King and Lewis spearheaded a renewed fight for equality.It should be pointed out that Democrats were the ones who passed the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act into law while Republicans began pandering to racist southerners and have turned their backs on their liberal past ever since.But now Republicans like LePage think that they are owed praise for ending slavery even though Republican today would like to bring slavery back.According to Alternet,Not content to merely support an insurrection against the duly elected government of the United States, 80 percent of the Republicans surveyed by CNN also expressed admiration for the leaders of the South a cabal whose allegiance to white supremacy was most tellingly summed up by the Vice President of the Confederacy s sentiment that its,  foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man, that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based on this great physical, philosophical and moral truth. In fact, 20 percent of Donald Trump supporters think freeing the slaves was a bad idea. Seriously.So the idea that John Lewis owes thanks to Republicans like LePage is absolutely laughable, especially since LePage has called for  people of color  to be shot.If the only civil rights accomplishment Republicans can point to is the freeing of the slaves 150 years ago, their r sum  is in severe need of an update. Of course, that will never happen because Republicans are controlled by racists. Abraham Lincoln is surely rolling in his grave.Featured image via Flickr",News,17-Jan-17
" Trump Brags About Number Of People Coming To Inauguration, Doesn’t Realize Most Are Protesters","With just three days until Inauguration Day, Donald Trump is desperately trying to convince everyone that it will be the most attended inauguration in history and that everyone likes him.For months, Trump has repeatedly tried and failed to get big-name entertainers to perform at the ceremony, with many even backing out after accepting the invitation. So far, Trump has only managed to get a reality show singer and a has-been band to commit.Experts predict that Trump s inauguration attendance will be smaller than President Obama s but that isn t stopping Trump from trying to convince everyone otherwise.People are pouring into Washington in record numbers. Bikers for Trump are on their way. It will be a great Thursday, Friday and Saturday!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 17, 2017Except Trump is delusional as usual.Not only are experts predicting that Trump s inauguration crowd will be far less than the record set by President Obama in 2008 at 1.8 million, he seems to be forgetting that many of those who are attending are going there to protest against him.In fact, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to participate in the Women s March on Washington, and it s being predicted that the demonstration will be bigger than the inauguration itself while also making history as the largest demonstration ever organized in the United States. Meanwhile, the Bikers for Trump that Trump bragged about are expected to only draw 5,000. And ticket scalpers are struggling to sell tickets to the inauguration. That s how unpopular Trump is right now.So once again, Trump s ego apparently took control of his Twitter account.And Twitter users shattered it.@realDonaldTrump they re protestors  Mike Denison (@mikd33) January 17, 2017@realDonaldTrump Do you really believe that your pee-wee band of trump grunts will out number the protesters sweetie? aww thats cute  Diva (@sammypolsen12) January 17, 2017.@realDonaldTrump Hate to break it to you, but more people will be protesting your inauguration than celebrating it. https://t.co/koIEU3A7iw  Al x Young  (@AlexYoung) January 17, 2017@realDonaldTrump Over a million less pouring in than Obamas inauguration  Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 17, 2017.@realDonaldTrump  We have a clip  pic.twitter.com/aDRpodgIMa  Christo Grozev (@christogrozev) January 17, 2017Reminder We the people DIDN T elect his KIDS 2 run OUR country.Actually We the people by a majority DIDN T elect @realDonaldTrump either. pic.twitter.com/bTkzxpoBy0  Lil  Kim Ms. G.O.A.T (@killerbee805) January 17, 2017@realDonaldTrump Does it makes you sad to be this historically unpopular?

 Vladimir Putin Just Defended Trump In The WORST Way Possible (VIDEO),"According to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, it s silly to worry about little things like whether or not a couple of Russian ladies peed on Donald Trump s bed because it s much, much worse to publish memos that reveal these allegations.Putin says that there is a conspiracy to  delegitimize  the man and his team of hackers, fake news writers, and trolls he worked hard to install in the Oval Office by hacking Trump s political opponents and running an aggressive propaganda campaign. I don t know Mr. Trump, I have never met him, I don t know what he will do in the international arena, so I have no reason either to attack him, criticize him or defend him, Putin said at a press conference. Donald Trump has been with the most beautiful women in the world, so why would he need prostitutes in Moscow? To answer that question, we need only look to a 2001 edition of the Howard Stern Show in which Trump was reminded that he bragged that he likes to go to Russia to have sex with women because they  have no morals. Putin says that Russian security services  do not chase every US billionaire,  and that the release of the documents was worse than prostitutes. In a way, he s right, as the documents presented to both Trump and President Obama also allege that members of the President-elect s campaign staff directly worked with the Russian government during the campaign.On numerous occasions, Trump has repeated Russian propaganda while attacking U.S. intelligence agencies that have been exposing him for what he is and, of course, has directly quoted Putin (a man whom Trump says is  very smart ) while hurling barbs at Hillary Clinton.Trump and Putin have been screaming about the  fake news  release of actual documents that actual intelligence agencies are in possession of, but the BBC reported recently that the whole pissing Russian ladies thing is just the tip of the iceberg. Correspondent Paul Wood revealed last week that at least four sources have confirmed the information, with one U.S. intelligence source informing him that there is audio and video of The Donald s escapades, and an Israeli news source reports that the country s spies have been warned against sharing information with the United States for fear that Trump will relay it to Putin.Putin and Trump s bromance is disconcerting at best   especially when more than a baker s dozen intelligence agencies have confirmed that the man who stood up to join Trump in his attacks on our intelligence agencies has been confirmed to have interfered in our election.Watch it below:Featured image via Getty Images",News,17-Jan-17
 Trump’s Ego Gets FLATTENED After He Claims Credit For Jobs Coming Back To United States,"Donald Trump is taking credit again for deals made by companies long before the election, and the Internet was quick to put his ego in check.Once again, Trump took to Twitter to brag about how he is supposedly responsible for auto companies like Ford and Fiat Chrysler announcing job creation and expansion in the United States.With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the U.S. (even before taking office), with all of the new auto plants coming back into our ..

 Green Day Just Gave Trump The ULTIMATE Pre-Inauguration ‘F*ck You’ And Conservatives Are FURIOUS (VIDEO/SCREENSHOTS),"On Friday, more than half the nation will mourn as a bigot with tiny hands and orange skin who is the physical embodiment of all that is wrong with our country is sworn into office. The other 48 percent will celebrate by burning crosses or whatever racists do with their friends these days. On Martin Luther King Day, punk band Green Day released a completely appropriate song that sums up this election and the resulting series of disasters both past and future perfectly.On Monday, our nation both celebrated the life of Dr. King and mourned the upcoming day when we hand over our car keys to the drunkest and most racist guy at the party. While many took the opportunity to toss Trump a nice  fuck you,  no one did it quite like Green Day did by dropping their new music video for their song,  Troubled Times. Today we celebrate love and compassion more than ever,  the band posted on Facebook in announcing the release of the song, which is over three minutes of anti-Trump goodness (especially if you watch the music video):Naturally, Trump s idiot fans rushed to the comment section of Green Day s YouTube post to prove the song right:               Recently, Green Day pissed off conservatives when Billy Joe busted out a  No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA  chant at the American Music Awards.

 WATCH: CNN Panel EXPLODES After Rick Santorum Gives DISGUSTING Defense Of Trump’s Racism,"There s one thing that Trump s surrogates all share, and that s a ridiculously blind loyalty to Trump. They can t see his evils, and their minds automatically twist any evil he says or does into something good.Such was the case on CNN, where Rick Santorum spoke up on Trump s trashing of civil rights icon John Lewis, who is also a Democratic representative from Georgia, and who said Trump is an illegitimate president.Trump has taken a lot of flak, especially given that he did it so close to Martin Luther King, Jr. s birthday. Former presidential adviser David Gergen was talking about why Trump was wrong to go after Lewis the way he did: This was an attack on [Lewis ] life, what he stands for, what he did for this country and marching across that bridge. Then former Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter weighed in with: When will the person who will be president act like a grownup and serious person, not always take the bait? Show some restraint, show some dignity. There is no bottom to the depth that he will go to argue with anyone, and cause disdain. Donald Trump was wrong. John Lewis is an icon. He can say whatever he wants. When Santorum got a chance to speak, he said he and most other people in politics would have handled Lewis  comments much differently. Then he put forth this obscene gem: Donald Trump is the president because he did things like this. Which just speaks to how low Trump s voters really are. If anyone can defend Trump s pettiness that way, or in any way, they are just as ridiculous as he is.Watch the fireworks below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,16-Jan-17
 WATCH: Trump Doesn’t Want Us To Remember What He Said About Russia In 2014,"As time goes on, it becomes ever clearer that Trump is Russia s puppet. There s every possibility he owes them money, and he s repeatedly blasted our intelligence community for daring to say that Russia did, indeed, engage in a concerted campaign to influence our election in Trump s favor. But did he always feel this way? Was he always Russia s puppet?It seems not, and it s by his own words that we know this. As recently as 2014, he said, in a series of interviews, that Mitt Romney was right to say that Russia was our greatest geopolitical foe: [Mitt] said [Russia is] a hell of a problem, and everybody laughed at him, including certain media, by the way. They laughed. It turned out that he s absolutely right. You look at what Russia s doing with Iran, how they controlled the situation, and Syria, and virtually every other place. He also insinuated that Obama was Putin s puppet because he felt we being meek and cowardly in the face of such a threat. We should definitely be strong, we should definitely do sanctions, and we have to show some strength. I mean, Putin has eaten Obama s lunch, therefore our lunch, for a long period of time. Now he says he s open to lifting our sanctions on Russia if we can all just get along, which is never going to happen because Russia is ruled by an autocrat. If we lift the sanctions, Russia will pull Trump s puppet strings even more. He also seems to like to kiss Putin s ass, mouth, and dick   he doesn t criticize Russia at all, and staunchly defends them against other criticisms and revelations.Here s his stance back in 2014:In other words, this is another position on which he s flip-flopped. He just says whatever his strongest manhandlers want him to say. Whether they re his supporters, or foreign powers hoping to use him for their own gain, he says whatever he thinks will win him the most points.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images",News,16-Jan-17
 Yet ANOTHER Dem Lawmaker To Snub Trump Inaugural Over Lewis Attacks,"Georgia Congressman John Lewis is a living legend. At 76 years old, and as someone who was beaten nearly to death fighting for civil rights, he has the right to say anything he likes. Therefore, the idea of attacking him, as Donald Trump has been doing all through his Martin Luther King, Jr., weekend, is nothing short of repulsive.Those attacks have led to a massive boycott of Trump s inauguration, especially among Democratic lawmakers. The latest to announce that he will skip Trump s party is Rep. Keith Ellison, who is also in the running to become the head of the Democratic National Committee. Ellison says of the decision:I will not celebrate a man who preaches a politics of division and hate. I won't be attending Donald Trump's inauguration.  Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) January 16, 2017Rep. Ellison also made it clear that he is on the side of John Lewis, and is just as appalled as all decent people at Trump s attacks on the civil rights icon. Prior to tweeting his decision regarding Trump s inauguration, Ellison also tweeted:No question I am #StandingwithJohnLewis and the millions of people around the country who have been targeted by @realDonaldTrump.  Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) January 16, 2017The time is always right to do what is right. And in the face of so much hate, the right thing to do is reject it.  Rep.

Keith Ellison (@keithellison) January 16, 2017Rep. Ellison is clearly ready to battle Donald Trump, along with other Democrats on Capitol Hill. Trump really crossed the line with his attacks on John Lewis, and he did the biggest favor ever for progressives by showing his true colors. Some people and events are untouchable, and attacking a living civil rights legend on Martin Luther King, Jr., weekend is at the top of that list.Godspeed, Rep. Ellison. Thank you for standing up for what is right.Featured image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images",News,16-Jan-17
" Trump STRANDED, In Full Panic As ANOTHER Performer Drops Out Of Inauguration (DETAILS)","President-elect Donald Trump has had trouble finding people to perform at his inauguration from the moment he won the election. While A-list artists have usually jumped at the opportunity to sing or play for a new President, celebrities have turned Trump down left and right. It s been a massive public embarrassment for Trump, even as his team uses bribery to get gigs and continues to fail.The humiliation is far from over. The VERY few acts that agreed to perform for Trump are now dwindling. The latest to pull out just days before Trump s big day is the B-Street Band, a Bruce Springsteen cover band. The cover band has just announced that, due to the backlash the group received since news broke that they would play for Trump, they are abandoning the gig.In an interview with Rolling Stone, Will Forte, the group s keyboardist, manager, agent and publicist, said that the band received  thousands of emails  that made the band reconsider. He recalled saying to his band members,  We re standing out in the storm right here. We gotta get out of the storm. Due to the fact that Springsteen himself had publicly condemned Trump many times before, the band thought it would only be right to honor him and the fans that had made the Springsteen cover band a reality. Forte said: We owe everything to [Bruce] and our gratitude and respect to the band is imperative above all else. We felt that we had to make it known that we didn t want to seem disrespectful, in any way, shape or form, to Bruce and his music and his band. I don t want to upset them. We owe everything to him and our gratitude and respect to the band is imperative above all else. It became clear to us that this wasn t working and we just had to do what we thought was the right thing to do and that was to pull out. TwitterThe B-Street Band had actually signed a contract in 2013 to play at this year s gig, but that was before the presidential nominees had been voted on. The band never thought they might have to play for Trump. Forte revealed: As time went by, the complexity of the situation became real immense and intense. The band was caught in a hurricane. We didn t see this coming, of course. When I started this band 37 years ago, it was only about performing and making people happy. I never thought the distortion of what we do as a band would ve been so intense. I wish it never would ve happened. We would ve never got involved in this if I knew how this would turn out. I would trade in all the support and publicity just to go back to where we were four months ago. I don t think they ll ever be a cover band of our size in the history of music that will get the attention of something this big. I m worn out. The band s worn out. Everybody loves to have their 15 minutes of fame, but maybe not this way. TwitterForte acknowledges that the the B-Street Band may now be punished financially for breaking the contract, but considers its stance more important. Forte said: So far, it s okay. But that s all I can say. Whatever the consequences are for breaking a contract, I m willing to take because this is much more important. Trump is literally about to be left stranded at his inauguration.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",News,16-Jan-17
 Racist-As-F*ck GOP Mayor BUSTED On Tape Calling Black People ‘Chimps’ And ‘N****rs’ (AUDIO),"Apparently, Republicans were serious when they decided that Trump s election means they don t have to  be politically correct  (translation: pretend to be decent human beings) anymore. Recordings obtained by the heroes at Motor City Muckraker have caught yet another member of the Grand Old Party acting like a racist and sexist jackass or, if you prefer, being himself.Today s subject is Warren, Michigan  Mayor Jim Fouts. The recordings include a few interesting right-wing  facts.  For instance, here is Fouts explaining that  blacks do look like chimpanzees. Here he is just straight-up saying  n*gger. In another recording, Fouts explains that he won t date older women because they re ugly and  dried out. In another recording, he further explains that older women are  mean, hateful, dried-up c*nts In December, Fouts was fired from his weekly A.M. radio show for saying that the disabled  aren t even human beings.  But according to him, all of it was completely fabricated by one of his critics, who apparently is a master of impressions. This recording was not me! (he has the expertise available to him to electronically engineer it),  Fouts wrote in a December Facebook post after he was fired for his remarks about the differently-abled.  This is a PHONY tape.  Like Trump, he claims there is a  pretty brutal negative agenda  against him   one in which even reality is participating.Featured image via Facebook",News,16-Jan-17
 Here’s The Disgusting Letter The FBI Sent To MLK They Don’t Want You To See (UNCENSORED IMAGE),"While Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. s life and legacy are deservedly well-celebrated now, that was not always how he was viewed. Especially by those in authority.King was shaking up business as usual, and many, many people didn t like that. You can t change the world without ruffling a few feathers, and he definitely did that.In fact, here s an uncensored letter from the FBI to Dr. King that was posted by The New York Times from the National Archives.It read: KING,In view of your low grade, abnormal personal behavior I will not dignify your name with either a Mr. or a Reverend or a Dr. And, your last name calls to mind only the type of King such as KingHenry the VIII and his countless acts of adultery and immoral conduct lower than that of a beast. Click the image to read the letter in full:National Archives via NY TimesThey tell him: There is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. They are basically telling Dr. King to kill himself, and giving him a deadline or they ll  out  him, so to speak for all these allegedly evil doings. It s absurd, to be blunt. Absolutely disgusting, to be honest.While the nation praises Dr. King today, we cannot forget how ugly the past truly was, and horribly he was treated. This letter was sent only about 50 years ago. So, we ve come a long way in a short amount of time, but we still have such a long way to go.Featured image via J. Wilds/Keystone/Getty Images",News,16-Jan-17
 Georgia GOP Official Celebrates MLK Day By Calling Civil Rights Legend John Lewis A ‘Racist Pig’,"As Trump skips out on a planned Martin Luther King Day visit to the new Smithsonian African-American history museum after a weekend of hate-tweeting civil rights legend John Lewis, others in the GOP are attempting to match, if not surpass, The Donald in horribleness.A member of Georgia s Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners decided that the weekend preceding a holiday celebrating civil rights was exactly the right moment to join Trump in layering on the hate against John Lewis. This backlash comes in response to Lewis  absolutely accurate statement that Trump   who is due to be sworn in as Grand Wizard of the United States of America on Friday   is an  illegitimate  president.Now, most might look at Trump   a guy who became President with the helpful input of a hostile foreign dictator s propaganda and fake news campaign (with a sprinkling of hacking of Trump s political opponents) and who represents everything we are against in our nation   and at least agree that Lewis has a point. But not Tommy Hunter. Like Trump, he hopped on social media over the weekend and threw a racist tantrum. John Lewis is a racist pig,  Hunter posted on Saturday, eloquently adding that  there ain t one political pundit that didn t say on November 9 that this would be Demonrats EXACT response to Trump winning.  Hunter explained that  Demonrats DO NOT live in reality because the polls failed to predict that 48 percent of people who lived in the right place at the right time were able to successfully select a president that the majority didn t want.  What a bunch of idiots,  Hunter said. John Lewis  district is drawn to keep him in power,  he later continued. His wins are all illegitimate. How can other reps be concerned about working with him. John Lewis fought, bled, was arrested for, and dedicated his entire life to fighting for the right for all Americans to vote. Hunter? Well, he sits on Facebook and whines about politics, spams his friends  news feeds with posts about Facebook, and he enjoys fishing.Gwinnett Democratic Party, Gabe Okoye, called Hunter a  disgrace to Gwinnett County in particular and Georgia in general  in response to the posts, calling for the Trump fan s resignation.Hunter deleted the posts along with one demanding to know if there are  any white guys  on the University of Alabama s football team and several other miscellaneous posts in response to the inevitable backlash. He also changed his privacy settings so he can continue to post hateful garbage in his circle of friends without anyone else knowing. While I am grateful for what the Congressman did in Selma and other times during the civil rights movement, you get respect by showing respect,  Hunter told  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution after he got caught being a racist douchebag.  He is using his fame as a way to continually divide the races and in this case standing on the very much unsubstantiated claim that the guy I voted for [Trump] is racist and only won because of Russians hacking the election which, of course, we all know didn t occur. Lewis, of course, is doing none of those things   but Hunter actually claiming that Russia did not hack the election demonstrates his exact mindset. Apparently, he is crazy enough to refuse to believe something even Trump has now reluctantly admitted is true yet sure enough of himself to spew racist garbage while calling an African-American civil rights hero a  racist.

 WATCH: Elizabeth Warren OWNS Trump In Scathing Defense Of Rep. John Lewis,"Civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis just got support from someone Donald Trump fears most.After calling Trump illegitimate over the weekend, Lewis was attacked by Trump on Twitter on Sunday morning in yet another demonstration of how petty and thin-skinned Trump is.Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk   no action or results. Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017That s right. Trump literally called Lewis  all talk  and  no action  and bashed the city of Atlanta despite the fact that the city is not the hellscape Trump claims it to be. In fact, the city hit back at Trump because Atlanta is a thriving city and the crown jewel of Georgia.It is also a fact that John Lewis tirelessly fought for civil rights and voting rights and marched with Martin Luther King. He even suffered brutal beatings by police for peacefully protesting.Trump, meanwhile, was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and inherited his fortune from his wealthy daddy. He never had to work a day in his life and he certainly never fought for anything or anyone but himself.Trump has drawn outrage across the nation over his attack, and Senator Elizabeth Warren fired back at Trump in defense of Lewis on Monday during the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Breakfast in Boston.Warren slammed Trump for never putting his life at risk for anything and said Lewis has earned the right to criticize Trump and boycott the inauguration. The president-elect stepped over a line when he attacked John Lewis as a man who is all talk and no action,  Warren declared.  John Lewis is a man who literally put his life on the line to make this a better country, a fairer country, a country that is more open. Donald Trump hasn t put his life on the line for anyone except Donald Trump. John Lewis has earned the right to raise questions about legitimacy. Right now, our intelligence community tells us that Russia directly interfered in the election here in the United States. John Lewis has a question about that and if John Lewis wants not to attend because of that, that s certainly his right. Here s the video via Twitter.Video: @SenWarren says @realDonaldTrump  stepped over a line  criticizing @repjohnlewis #mapoli pic.twitter.com/eu079Winf7  Gintautas Dumcius (@gintautasd) January 16, 2017Warren is right. Lewis literally bled for this country while Trump dodged the draft during the Vietnam War because he cares nothing about this country. The only reason he ran for president was so he could enrich himself and his family. It s definitely not about helping the American people, or else he would not be cheering about millions of Americans being stripped of their health care. Lewis, on the other hand, has fought for bettering the lives of all Americans for decades and he deserves respect for that and an apology from Trump.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,16-Jan-17
 Amazon Sells Out Of John Lewis’ Biographies After Trump Attack,"Conservatives are, once again, on the losing side of the conversation. Days after president-elect Donald Trump attacked Rep. John Lewis, Amazon.com saw a flood of book-buyers purchasing Lewis  autobiography, Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement.Within several days, the book, first published in 1999, completely sold out and became Amazon s number one bestseller.For three days, the product has been out-of-stock.Lewis  2012 book, Across That Bridge: Life Lessons and a Vision for Change, has also climbed to the number one spot on Amazon and is also temporarily sold out, having been out-of-stock for several days.Lewis  three-part graphic novel, March, has also catapulted to a number one bestselling spot.Celebrities and social media presences like author Anne Rice have called on followers and fans alike to buy Lewis  books and make them bestsellers:Just bought Lewis   Walking with the Wind  on Amazon. Let s make it a bestseller. https://t.co/AGUUje7WAC  Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) January 14, 2017It worked.Turns out that when someone like Donald Trump attacks a cultural, political, and social icon like John Lewis in such a disgusting manner, the public responds and picks the right side.The attack on Congressman Lewis (and his hardworking district) has also prompted rave reviews of his biographies, renewed attention on the plight of black America, and exposes Trump as the racist demagogue he is.It s also helped Democrats rally around one of America s living treasures, steering the conversation.But never fear, book and Lewis lovers, Amazon will still allow you to pre-order the biographies until they get more copies available, in which they will send them to your house as soon as possible.If Donald Trump s phony, ghost-written Art of the Deal can become a bestseller once again, so can John Lewis  inspiring biographies.Karma sucks, but at the same time, it can be oh so sweet. In this case, it s more than sweet   it s completely satisfying.Featured image via Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images",News,16-Jan-17
" Trump Declares NATO ‘Obsolete,’ Wants European Union Disbanded In Frightening Interview","Donald Trump is paving the way for Russian aggression against Europe and admitted it during an interview with European newspapers.Trump has had a cozy relationship with Putin ever since Russia helped him win the election in November.In fact, that was the consummation of a relationship that began months earlier when Trump started attacking NATO and made it clear that he intends to eliminate sanctions that were slapped against Russia after Putin seized the Crimea from Ukraine.Now Trump is practically inviting Russia to be more aggressive in Putin s pursuit of tyrannical rule. I said a long time ago that NATO had problems,  Trump told the Times of London on Sunday.  Number one it was obsolete because it was designed many, many years ago. Number two the countries weren t paying what they re supposed to be paying. Trump then went on to praise Putin and stated his intention to make  some good deals  with Russia, which apparently involves weakening NATO and Europe as a whole so Russia can attack.To that end, Trump also wants to see the European Union dissolve, which would cause transatlantic chaos not seen since World War II. People want their own identity, so if you ask me, more countries will leave,  Trump remarked when asked about the United Kingdom s regretful vote to exit the EU.In other words, Trump wants Europe to return to the nationalism that divided nations against each other and caused the deaths of millions. The two World Wars were the reason why the European Union was created in the first place, not to mention the economic benefits both sides of the Atlantic have enjoyed.According to the Washington Post,The full ramifications of a breakdown in transatlantic relations are so extensive they are difficult to total. U.S. guarantees underpin European security. The United States and the European Union, with a population of 500 million, are each other s most important trading partner. For decades, European nations and the United States have worked tightly together on issues of war, peace and trade. The incoming U.S. president is the first American leader since World War II not to support European integration. The European Union has long been considered to be in the U.S. interest, because it created a unified market for U.S. businesses, provided a bulwark against communism during the Cold War and helped quell the bloody slaughter that cost U.S. lives, among others, in the first half of the 20th century. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the European Union expanded eastward into formerly communist nations, a development that leaders there say helped bring rule of law and stability as they modernized their economies.The only nation that would directly benefit from the fall of NATO and the European Union would be Russia, while America and the various European nations suffer weaker economies and weaker national security.In other words, Trump truly is Putin s puppet and the world is about to become more dangerous because of it.Featured image via screenshot",News,16-Jan-17
" Trump’s Favorability Rating Hits Historic, Record Low","Americans are waking up. After being promised Trump would change his tune once elected, the people have been shown that he will not, in any sense of the word, change his tune.He s still the same loud, obnoxious, shady, thin-skinned demagogue he was when he announced his candidacy.It s because of this (and other damning information) that the American people are giving him low approval ratings, and rightly so. In fact, his approval ratings have hit a record and historic low for any incoming president.A new Gallup Poll shows that 55 percent of Americans hold a negative view of Trump, while 40 percent have a favorable view.According to the poll:President-elect Donald Trump approaches Inauguration Day with a significantly lower favorable rating than his three immediate predecessors received when they were presidents-elect. Trump s 40% favorable rating is roughly half of what Barack Obama enjoyed before his inauguration in 2009 (78%) and is much lower than the pre-inaugural ratings for George W. Bush (62%) and Bill Clinton (66%)   Of the four most recent incoming presidents, Trump is the only president-elect whose unfavorable rating outweighs his favorable score.The best part lies within his own party: he has a lower approval rating from Republicans than any other GOP president. While George Bush nabbed 97 percent approval among the GOP, Trump only has 82 percent.Like Trump, Mike Pence and Melania Trump also face historic low approval ratings for the vice presidency and first lady respectively.America really hates Donald Trump and his ilk. That s a start.Congratulations, America, you elected a universally hated fascist who picks fights with John Lewis instead of Vladimir Putin.Gallup summed up what will be the state of the union for the next few months:But he enters office with a significantly more negative image than prior presidents-elect have had and with a less positive image even among those who identify with his own party. The president-elect s general unpopularity is an unprecedented hurdle, whose impact on his ability to govern remains to be seen.Trump was illegitimately elected, lost the popular vote, and is hated by the American people. He has absolutely no mandate, no legitimacy, no room to bargain. The honeymoon is officially over.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,16-Jan-17
 Internet EATS TRUMP ALIVE For Generic MLK Tweet After Weekend Of Bashing John Lewis (TWEETS),"Over the weekend Donald Trump has been bashing Civil Rights icon Rep.

 WATCH: Chinese State Media Is Literally Laughing At American Embarrassment Trump,"Donald Trump has turned America into an international laughingstock and he hasn t even taken office yet.For weeks, Trump has been antagonizing China by speaking with the leader of Taiwan, which goes against decades of precedent, and has questioned the One-China policy. Both actions have put a strain on America s relationship with the most populous nation on Earth.Clearly, Donald Trump intends to keep taking aim at our largest trading partner, imperiling both our foreign policy and the world economy at a time when Americans are prospering under the economic successes of President Obama.Well, China is now laughing at Trump for being a national embarrassment.CNN s John Berman pointed out that an editorial by state-run Global Times of China mocked Trump. Trump s thinking about China is becoming increasingly clear: He wants China to make huge economic and trade concessions to the U.S. To achieve that, he is willing to stir certain calm areas in China-U.S. relations, including treating the Taiwan issues as his trump card. We were simply angry initially, but now we can t help but laugh at this U.S. leader-in-waiting. Maybe American voters  promoted  him too quickly, his amateur remarks and over-confident manner are equally shocking. Here s the video via YouTube.A separate editorial in the Global Times warns that Trump s arrogance will likely lead to a major confrontation between the United States and China.The  leader  of world order seems to be throwing away its job to grab the most advantages. The chaos it may bring to the world is much more severe than a war or a crisis. China faces the challenge of Trump s meddling with the one-China policy.Moreover, China may suffer from a shaken world order. The one-China policy is one part of the existing world order. Trump not only wants to scrap the one-China policy, but also aims at an overall change.In a changing landscape, enhancing one s own strength is most important. Trump has shown strategic arrogance that is beyond America s strength and he seems to be confident that anyone he asks will yield to him.It is quite likely that China and the US will face a head-on confrontation. China must be quick in preparing for sharp provocations from the Trump administration. China s win over this confrontation will serve as the basis for normal exchanges between the two in the future.This is why Americans need to oust Trump before it s too late. He is not only turning America into a joke on the world stage, he is bullying a nation that could punish us economically and go toe to toe with us militarily. We need to cultivate our relationship with China, not sever it. Antagonizing China will only piss them off and make things much more complicated. That s not what America needs right now.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,16-Jan-17
 ‘Not Funny!’: Sean Spicer Whines About SNL After Baldwin Returns As Trump (VIDEO),"The thin-skinned president-elect took his angry little fingers to his Twitter account to moan about Saturday Night Live s skit this weekend. Alec Baldwin knows how to get under Donald Trump s skin and it s glorious to watch.Incoming press secretary Sean Spicer was upset as he spoke with Tamron Hall and Willie Geist of the NBC TODAY Show Monday about the comedy skit.Alec Baldwin returned to play the part of Donald Trump this weekend to hit on the 35-page dossier alleging that Trump paid prostitutes to take part in Golden Showers at a hotel in Moscow. I d like to ask you about your big Russian pee-pee party,  the reporter said. No, no,  Baldwin s Trump told the reporters.  I m not talking about the pee-pee. It didn t happen. It wasn t as cool as it sounds. Next question. But that was too much for Spicer to handle. He called the comedy show disappointing  and  not funny. It was not funny; it was mean-spirited,  Spicer said.  And it s gone from being a show you could sit back and get a good laugh out of to being something that s frankly mean and bad television,  he continued.It was funny, though.Watch:The Twitter-addicted president-elect took to Twitter to cry about the show.  @NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!,  he tweeted.It s a comedy skit and the more Team Trump rants against it, the more the show s ratings will peak. Somewhere, Alec Baldwin is smiling because again, he got under Donald J. Trump s skin simply by impersonating him on a late night comedy show.In Barack Obama s final interview with  60 Minutes  as president, he said  thick skin  is an important quality to have when serving as the commander-in-chief.  Thick skin helps  in getting the job done, the president said.Grow up, Donald. Life is hard. We can t wait to see the SNL skit after Trump s impeachment hearings.Featured image via screen capture.

" Republicans Are Working To Make It LEGAL To Injure, Kill Protesters In North Dakota","Oh, North Dakota. They just had to go and set the bar lower for themselves. Instead of figuring out why protesters disrupted a lot during the long fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline and maybe finding a productive solution to disruption, they ll just try and eliminate protesters in a way that skirts the 1st Amendment.And it s really horrific. This allegedly  pro-life  crowd wants to make it legal for drivers to run over anyone blocking a roadway. They hate protesters to the point where they actually introduced a bill in the state legislature to do just that: A driver of a motor vehicle who negligently causes injury or death to an individual obstructing vehicular traffic on a public road, street, or highway may not be held liable for any damages,  the bill reads.  A driver of a motor vehicle who unintentionally causes injury or death to an individual obstructing vehicular traffic on a public road, street, or highway is not guilty of an offense. Yeah.  Unintentionally.  Well, that just makes everything okay, then, doesn t it? Infuriatingly, they say that this is necessary after the DAPL protests, and they claim that pedestrians are intentionally putting themselves in danger if they protest on roads. Because protests are supposed to happen in the background where they won t make people uncomfortable.What s the difference between this and running over someone who s just jaywalking? Isn t that person intentionally putting themselves in danger? The bill doesn t actually mention protesters, so it s somewhat safe to assume that someone guilty of hitting just any jaywalker out there could get away with it, too. No compensation for medical bills or funeral costs, no punitive damages for the family of the victim. It s sick.The big problem here is proving intent. Proving intent, or lack of intent, is really fucking difficult to do. So North Dakota is working on making the world more dangerous for pedestrians and for protesters, because, reasons. Reasons that involve terrifying people into not protesting.Republicans really are a sick breed.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,16-Jan-17
 Trump’s Team Just Slapped A TERRIFYING Label On The White House Press Corps – Gets Smacked HARD,"Trump s war on the media didn t end with his election. On his planet, everything the media says about him that makes him look bad is just a vast conspiracy to undermine him and make him look bad. This immature attitude is beginning to bleed over onto the White House press corps now, who may find themselves without access to the White House very soon, because Trump and his team are seriously considering kicking them out of the White House press room.Yes, really, that s what they re considering. From Esquire:Another senior official, however, suggested a more pointed motivation for the move. According to the official, the potential relocation reflected a view within the transition team that coverage of Trump has been so hostile as to indicate that the press has abandoned its role as neutral observer. They are the opposition party,  a senior official says.  I want  em out of the building. We are taking back the press room. They re  the opposition party.  Well, isn t that a nice way of saying they re the enemy. They want sycophants in the press, not honest press.  We are taking back the press room.  Really? Who did it belong to before? Their idea of  taking back the press room  reeks of  taking back America. Or, to put it bluntly, they re remaking the White House and America into an image more to their liking. It s one that doesn t include anyone who opposes Trump.The press corps is, understandably, upset about this.

A question is: Is a room that has forty-nine seats adequate? When we had that press conference the other day, we had thousands of requests, and we capped it at four hundred. Is there an opportunity to potentially allow more members of the media to be part of this? That s something we re discussing. The White House press room is supposed to be a symbol of a free press, but neither Trump nor anybody on his team believes in a free press. A free press is critical. A free press doesn t bow and scrape. Anytime they don t like what the press is reporting, they scream  FAKE NEWS!  And it should terrify all of us because it s the first real step they could take towards actually censoring the media.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images",News,16-Jan-17
 GOP Congressman Hosts Repeal Obamacare Town Hall; It Didn’t Go The Way He Wanted (VIDEO),"Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colorado) is one of the Republicans who is dead set on repealing the Affordable Care Act. Before Saturday, he thought his constituents were with him, that is, until he held a town hall meeting. It went so badly for him that he snuck out before the end.About 150 people showed up at the Aurora Public Library on Saturday. Less than half of those, though, got to speak with the Congressman, and then each of them only got five minutes.Despite booking a large room with ample space, Coffman allowed in only four constituents at once for five minutes at a time. When the crowd grew restless, police put up crime scene tape and Coffman snuck out the back door six minutes before the event was scheduled to end.Source: SlateColorado was one of the states to embrace the Affordable Care Act. Under the law, the state s number of uninsured was cut by more than half.Despite that, Coffman has been on the front line of the repeal movement. The day before the town hall, Coffman wrote an op-ed in the Denver Post advocating its repeal.Yet Coffman has not proposed a clear replacement for the law, an issue constituents hoped to ask him about on Saturday.  I am potentially going to lose my health insurance,  Berthie Ruoff told NBC 9 while she waited to meet with her representative.  I ve had a preexisting condition. I ve had breast cancer. What s going to happen to me? My spouse who had health insurance passed away. What do I do? You know, what am I supposed to do? The crowd at the town hall wasn t sympathetic. Coffman didn t talk to anyone who was at risk for losing their insurance. The crowd reacted by singing, yes singing, and then Coffman snuck out.A few people noticed Coffman sneaking out and attempted to address him.  Next time,  one woman pleaded,  please be sure you hear all your constituents!  Coffman ignored them, hopped into a waiting car, and drove away.  Have a good afternoon!  yelled another exasperated woman.Coffman blamed the time. He said they only had 90 minutes and that the event was only supposed to be one on one.Here s the video of the crowd singing:Crowd starts singing while trying to get in to see Congressman Mike Coffman in Aurora. He only agreed with people a couple at a time. #9News pic.twitter.com/bqZgj4FF6f  Nelson Garcia (@9NewsEducation) January 14, 2017Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,16-Jan-17
 Anonymous Just Took An Interest In Donald Trump’s Russian Lady Pee Saga (TWEETS),"Donald Trump once again attacked our intelligence community for spreading  fake news  on Sunday, but this time he received a response he probably didn t want.

The recordings were released by Gawker, which was killed off thanks to an aggressive legal attack campaign spearheaded by a guy Trump wants to put on the Supreme Court and carried out by Melania Trump s lawyer.Will Trump s election be enough to rally the Anons to action? Maybe. Are they exactly the heroes we need right now? Probably.Featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla)/screengrab",News,15-Jan-17
 Trump Finally Watched Alec Baldwin Mock His Russia Pee Party On SNL And Went BALLISTIC On Twitter,"It took Donald Trump all day, but he apparently got around to watching the cold open Saturday Night Live delivered last night and threw a temper tantrum about it.Alec Baldwin made his triumphant return as Trump on SNL this weekend and nailed a re-enactment of Trump s first press conference in six months.The questions, of course, were all about the dossier alleging that Trump paid prostitutes to pee on his bed at the Ritz Carlton in Moscow. No, no,  Baldwin s Trump told the media when asked about the pee parties.  I m not talking about the pee-pee. It didn t happen. It wasn t as cool as it sounds. Next question. And then he had to answer a question about the  golden shower  report. I do not want to talk about the pee-pee. I want to talk about what is really important. I want to bring a thick stream of jobs back. The biggest strongest steadiest stream you ve ever seen. Here s the full video via YouTube.Normally, Trump would have whined about SNL on Twitter at 3 a.m., or during regular morning hours, but this time he waited until Sunday afternoon to do it.Trump attacked NBC as a network first, and then trashed Saturday Night Live along with the cast and called their skits about him a  hit job. .@NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017Yes, a man who is about to take over the toughest job in the world is literally once again obsessing over how he is being portrayed on a satire comedy program.He threw a temper tantrum over something he should be able to ignore, thus proving that he is incapable of focusing on the job at hand, and that he is a petty, thin-skinned bully.Needless to say, Twitter mercilessly mocked him for it.@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews uh have you ever watched The Apprentice?

 Trump Demands Apology From The Media And Gets Told To Go F*ck Himself,"Donald Trump, the pathetic man who has yet to apologize for all the hateful and divisive things he said throughout his campaign, is demanding an apology from the media.Seriously.Trump has been lashing out at the media and the intelligence community all weekend over a dossier revealing that he paid prostitutes to pee on the bed in the presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton hotel in Moscow, and also reveals that his campaign colluded with Russia to win the election.He whined about the media during his first press conference in six months, resorting to calling CNN and Buzzfeed  fake news  for running the story.Now Trump is crowing because legendary reporter Bob Woodward, who shall now be known as a sell-out, agreed with him that the dossier should never have been reported on, which would have hidden information from the American people. His demand for an apology was written in all caps, even though he has failed to apologize for any of the insults and offensive statements he said during his campaign.Thank you to Bob Woodward who said,  That is a garbage document it never should have been presented Trump s right to be upset (angry)  Donald J.

 Atlanta Mayor And Newspaper DESTROY Trump For Attacking Their City And Rep. John Lewis,"Donald Trump called Atlanta a  crime infested  city that is  falling apart  in response to Rep. John Lewis calling him illegitimate. That was a YUUUGE mistake.One of America s most influential southern cities just hit back at Trump for attacking the congressman who represents them in a scathing editorial on the front page of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Sunday.Earlier this week, Rep. Lewis stated his belief that Trump is an illegitimate president. In response, Trump attacked Lewis on Twitter and the district Lewis represents, which includes the city of Atlanta, Georgia.Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk   no action or results. Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017Trump literally accused Lewis of being  all talk  and  no action.  This comes from a wealthy prick who dodged the draft during the Vietnam War and obtained his riches through inheritance while Lewis was busy fighting for civil rights and voting rights, and getting beaten by police for it during the Civil Rights Movement. Indeed, Lewis has been a tireless crusader for equal rights and a tireless public servant for the city of Atlanta, the state of Georgia, and the United States.Trump immediately drew backlash for his attack, including from Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed..@RepJohnLewis is an American hero & a national treasure. Period. Full stop. (1/3) pic.twitter.com/SN9W4uY31c  Kasim Reed (@KasimReed) January 14, 2017That PEOTUS Trump would attack Congressman Lewis on MLK Day weekend for  all talk no action  when he bled to actually  Make America Great  Kasim Reed (@KasimReed) January 14, 2017is why far less than half the country supports him at the dawn of his presidency. #HeStoodUpForUs #LetsStandForHim  Kasim Reed (@KasimReed) January 14, 2017And the Atlanta Journal-Constitution followed that up with a blistering defense of the city and Lewis.The newspaper pointed out that many Atlanta residents slammed Trump for ignoring Lewis  accomplishments and informed Trump that Atlanta boasts a strong and thriving downtown area with great neighborhoods.The congressional district that Lewis represents includes many of Atlanta s crown jewels as well as pockets of poverty. It runs from Buckhead to Decatur, over to Atlanta s Westside and reaches south to include Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and parts of Clayton County. Georgia went for Trump, but the 5th Congressional District and the city of Atlanta as a whole remain solidly Democratic and supported Hillary Clinton over Trump in November.The district that Trump described as in  horrible shape  includes Emory University and Morehouse College, as well as Spelman College and Georgia Tech. The Coca-Cola headquarters is just one of that district s many, high-profile corporate residents. Lewis represents Midtown s shiny residential high-rises and the pricey Intown neighborhoods filled with renovated homes, the Beltline and Ponce City Market.The newspaper also pointed out that Trump once sought to build a skyscraper in the same city he is now calling  horrible  and  crime infested. Atlantans understood Saturday that a political fight was playing out. But, the city wondered, did Trump, who once aspired to add his own skyscraper to the city s skyline, really think Atlanta was a depressing, dangerous place to live? In short, Trump is a hypocritical bully who will do anything to attack someone who criticizes him, even if it means flat-out lying.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",News,15-Jan-17
 Trump Whines About How Divided Our Nation Is And Gets SHAMED For Being A Hypocrite,"After a year and half of doing nothing but dividing Americans on the campaign trail, Donald Trump is now whining about how divided this country has become.Once again using Twitter as his platform to display his hypocrisy, Trump had the gall to forcefully and angrily complain that America is too  untrusting  and divided and declared that things will change when he takes office on January 20th. You know, because Trump is delusional and thinks that he is the magic solution to all of America s problems.For many years our country has been divided, angry and untrusting. Many say it will never change, the hatred is too deep. IT WILL CHANGE!!!!  Donald J.
